We collect such Personal Information when you provide it to us, such as when you:</p>

                    <li>Otherwise communicate with us.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Several of the services that we offer require registration as a condition of use. We may also receive Personal Information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.</p>
                <p>Please note that Ziff Davis is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in our forums, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, or other publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile or other areas that allow users to upload or post content.

                <h3 class="policy-subheading">Part 2: <span class="italicized">Other Information We Collect:</span></h3>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Cookies</span> are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. Please see our <a href="http://corp.ign.com/policies/cookie-eu" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> for more information, including a more in-depth explanation of what cookies are, the different types of cookies used on Ziff Davis sites, and how to change or delete them.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Log Files.</span> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality. </p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Web Beacons</span> are electronic files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Pixel Tags</span>, also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user’s computer to a third party website. Used in conjunction with cookies, Ziff Davis may use pixel tags to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns. Pixel tags are also used as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement, and they are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose. We use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Local Shared Objects</span> (“LSOs”) are found in technologies such as HTML5 or Flash to store user settings and video viewing history. Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use HTML5- or Flash-based LSOs to collect and store information.  Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">IP Addresses</span> are a unique string of numbers that identifies each computer attached to the Internet. We use IP Addresses to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may connect information about your IP Address to known corporate information and use associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market business-to-business services to the originating corporation or corporations. IP Addresses that we collect are sometimes linked to personally identifiable information. We use registration and email addresses that you provide together with IP Addresses and other information that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy. By combining the information, we are better able to understand our users and to better market services and products to our users.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Third Parties.</span> To improve the quality of some of our services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties. For example, if you access My IGN (my.ign.com) using a third party connection or log-in (such as Google+, Facebook or Yahoo!), we may also collect your user ID, username or email address associated with that third party service or any information you have made public in connection with that service or the third party shares with us. In addition, we may use data collected by a third party operator/licensee of localized versions or editions of PCMag.com, IGN.com, or AskMen.com. </p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Social Media Widgets.</span> Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, which include the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP Address, track which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our sites. <span class="bolded underlined">Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</span></p>

                <a name="what-we-provide-to-third-parties"></a>
                <h3 class="policy-subheading">What We Provide to Third Parties:</h3>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Statistical Reports and Mailing List</span>. The aggregate statistics that describe our online audience—which are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites—help us sell advertising and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and our brands. In addition, we make some information collected by our <a href="http://www.ziffdavisb2b.com" target="_blank">B2B</a> and <a href="http://www.emedia.com" target="_blank">emedia</a> divisions, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer's name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g. sale) to third party providers of goods and services when such information is provided in connection with webcasts and white papers or other sponsored downloads.  Please note that we only take such actions in connection with emails collected by PCMag, Toolbox.com, ITtoolbox, HR World, Inside CRM, IT Management, IT Security, Voip-News, and Web Hosting Unleashed. Please see the sections <a href="#webcasts">Webcasts</a> and <a href="#white-papers">White Papers/Other Sponsored Downloads</a> below to learn more. To learn how you can make choices about how this information is used or shared, please visit the <a href="#change-and-control">How You Can Change or Control What is Collected</a> section below.  </p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Email Deployment, Data Analysis, E-Commerce, and Other Services</span>. We provide customer lists, email addresses and other information to third party companies and contractors who provide us with specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, and customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, data and website hosting and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf, and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own permanent use. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service. They should also maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
                <p>Please note that we engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing the sale of subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, or other services. These service providers have access to or are provided with certain Personal Information (including credit card information) in order to provide us with the applicable service.</p>
                <a name="webcasts"></a>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Webcasts</span>. At times we produce and host sponsored webcasts for a variety of companies (“Sponsors”). Data collected during the registration process and the actual event may be shared with those Sponsors and others. The data is governed by our Privacy Policy and the third party’s privacy policy, and it may be used by us and the Sponsor for follow-up purposes.</p>
                <a name="white-papers"></a>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">White Papers/Other Sponsored Downloads.</span> Ziff Davis hosts product listings and offers informational downloads for a variety of third party vendors. When registration is required in order to receive or view the download, some or all data collected during product registration and/or Ziff Davis website registration may be shared with the vendor (and other third parties) in order to send information related to the topic of the white paper or product download.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Contests, Competitions, Sweepstakes and Prize Draws</span>. Data collected during the registration for contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws is used by us and may be shared with sponsors. Please read the contest rules carefully before you submit your data.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Co-Branded Sites and Services</span>. When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Ziff Davis), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner. Use of your information by such partners is subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">E-commerce</span>. When shopping on some of our sites or pages, users may need to provide personally identifiable information to third party partners that is necessary to fulfill an online order, including name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card number (with expiration date), and any of the above information needed to send a package to a gift recipient. <span class="bolded">Ziff Davis does not request, collect, store or have access to any credit card information.</span> If a user creates an account, the credit card information above will not be stored under their account. When placing an order, credit card information will be immediately entered onto a secure server of a PCI-compliant third party. We partner with a number of third parties to process and fulfill orders, send transactional emails, collect payment/credit card information and ensure delivery of downloads and packages. While these third parties may have access to Personal Information in order to perform their duties, they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</p>

                <h3 class="policy-subheading">What Third Parties and Ziff Davis May Collect:</h3>
                <a name="ad-serving"></a>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Online Ad Serving</span>. Ziff Davis and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our sites. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookie, pixel tag and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of Web and email advertisement and to create a record of interaction with our site content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites, or for reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on our sites. We will also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data. Ziff Davis and/or these third party advertisers may collect non-Personal Information about you for online behavioral advertising purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising from us in the future. <span class="bolded">The specific providers we use are subject to change.</span></p>

                <a name="what-we-do-with-collected"></a>
                <h3 class="policy-subheading">What Ziff Davis does with the Information It Collects</h3>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Personal Information</span>. How we use Personal Information is described in the section <a href="#what-we-provide-to-third-parties">What We Provide to Third Parties</a>.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Emails</span>. We use email addresses to send offers of services or products (and as set forth in the section <a href="#what-we-provide-to-third-parties">What We Provide to Third Parties</a>). Any recipient will be able to unsubscribe from receiving these emails by following the instructions at the bottom of the email.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Other Information: Ad Serving and Ziff Davis</span>. At times we display ads both on our network of owned and operated websites and on non-Ziff Davis websites. When you visit one of our websites or view ads that we serve off of our network elsewhere on the Internet, you may see multiple kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results and graphical ads shown on web pages. Sometimes these ads are based on the content of the page on which they appear. Other times these ads are generated by matching the ad to your interests as inferred from your browsing activities collected online. Either way, Ziff Davis tries to show you relevant ads, and to do so, we may use information we know or receive about you, such as your gender, location or interests.</p>
                <p><span class="italicized underlined">Interest-based Ads</span>. We use cookies, Javascript, pixel tags and other technology to collect information about (i) your visit to our sites and other third party partner websites that we do not own or operate but with whom we have agreements and (ii) your interaction with emails we deliver (“Online Data”). We analyze what pages you visit on our sites and the third party sites, what products or services you view, and whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you. We use this information to send you interest-based ads. All such data is also collected anonymously, and is aggregated with other data we collect and/or similar data collected by partners to create segments, groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location derived from your IP Address, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using our sites and services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.</p>
                <p class="bolded">We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your contact information or other data that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address), which we obtained as described above under <a href="#what-we-collect">Personal Information</a> and in some situations we combine the Online Data with your email address.</p>
                <p>We will engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data; and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These efforts do not result in the collection of personally identifiable information such as name or address; and we do not intentionally collect data that we consider to be sensitive, such as financial, health, or medical information or data concerning  racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or sex life. This data is not sold or transferred to any third party. Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this Online Data is retained for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire.
