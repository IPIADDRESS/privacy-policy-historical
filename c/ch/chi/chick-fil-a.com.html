        <h3>The <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> Franchise System</h3>
        <p>The Chick-fil-A franchise system is a restaurant network made up of company-operated, franchised, and licensed <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> restaurant businesses.  <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> franchisees (â<span class="underline">Franchised Operators</span>â or â<span class="underline">Operators</span>â) own and operate their own individual franchised businesses.  <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> licensees (â<span class="underline">Licensees</span>â) are granted a license to use <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span>âs trade name and marks in the sale of <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> products at <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> licensed locations.  Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee.  Please see the <span class="strong">Franchised Operator and Licensee Websites</span> section for more information regarding a Franchised Operatorâs or Licenseeâs website.</p>

Traffic Data does not typically include Personal Information, but rather is anonymous information that is helpful for our marketing purposes for improving your experience on our Sites.</p>
        <p><span class="italic">Cookies</span>.  We also use cookies, which are small text files that are stored on a userâs computer and allow websites to remember information about users (â<span class="underline">Cookies</span>â).  We use Cookies to monitor how our Sites are used and to help personalize your online experience.  Most browsers automatically accept Cookies.

        <h3>Information Security</h3>
        <p>We seek to keep your Personal Information secure and implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to help us protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.  When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information.  We also request that our third-party service providers use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or use.  However, no method of electronically transmitting or storing data is ever completely secure, and therefore, we cannot guarantee that your information will never be accessed, used, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>


        <h3>Links, Third-Party Websites, and Social Media Platforms</h3>
        <p>Our Sites and communications may contain links to other third-party websites, including, without limitation, the websites of Franchised Operators and Licensees, and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare (â<span class="underline">Linked Sites</span>â).

        <h3>Franchised Operator and Licensee Websites</h3>
        <p><span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span> Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties and may own, operate, and maintain a website for his, her, or its franchised or licensed restaurant business.  We do not:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, you should carefully review the privacy policy of each Franchised Operator or Licensee website that you visit.  Questions or concerns regarding any Franchised Operatorâs or Licenseeâs website should be directed to the Franchised Operator or Licensee, or to the Franchised Operatorâs or Licenseeâs site administrator or webmaster.</p>
        <p>We may, subject to certain terms and conditions, allow a Franchised Operator or Licensee to link to our Sites, provided that the Franchised Operator or Licensee agrees to abide by our current Privacy Policy in operating any such linked website.  <span class="no-wrap">Chick-fil-A</span>, however, is not responsible or liable for any Franchised Operator or Licensee website, even if it is linked to this Site, or for any Franchised Operatorâs or Licenseeâs online conduct and privacy practices.  </p>
