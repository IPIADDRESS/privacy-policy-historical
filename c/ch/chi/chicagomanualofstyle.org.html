      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>The following policy applies to all Web pages of The University of Chicago
      Press, including but not limited to www.press.uchicago.edu and www.chicagomanualofstyle.org unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <h3>Visitor Information</h3>
      <p>Our Web server log automatically collects and stores information from
        each site visitor. This information does not identify you personally.
        We automatically collect and store only the following information about
      your visit:</p>
      <ul class="fix_square_bullets">
        <li><span class="list_text">The Internet domain (for example, yourcompany.com or youruniversity.edu)
          and IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever
        you are online) from which you access our Web site.</span></li>
        <li><span class="list_text">The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site,
        and other details about your software and hardware configurations.</span></li>
        <li><span class="list_text">The date and time you access our site.</span></li>
        <li><span class="list_text">The pages you visit within our site.</span></li>
        <li><span class="list_text">If you linked to our pages from another Web site, the URL address
        of that Web site. </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>We use this information to manage and improve our Web site. Some data
        may be traceable to an individual, but we do not normally seek to identify
        visitors to the Web site unless we believe that someone is using our
      site improperly.</p>
      <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
      <p>We sometimes create a special file called a cookie to store log-in or
        other information on a user's computer. A cookie is a small amount of
        information that a Web site transfers to the hard drive of a user's computer.
        We use cookies to simplify users' access or to tailor our services to
        users' needs and interests. In some cases, we offer users the choice
        of having their user name or password stored in a cookie. However, we
      do not store credit card numbers in cookies.</p>
      <h3>Communication with Users</h3>
      <p>Through our Web site, we solicit comments and questions and offer users
        the opportunity to receive informational or promotional materials, including
        information about books and services of interest to them. A user who
        communicates with us for any of these purposes may be asked to provide
        standard contact information (e.g., name, mailing and e-mail addresses,
        and telephone numbers). We do not disclose this information except as
        described herein. In some instances we may ask registered users to choose
        whether to receive e-mail updates about our products and services, and
        we will honor the choices made. However, notwithstanding a user’s
        choice, we reserve the right to e-mail customers on occasions when we
      think it is important.</p>
      <h3>Customer Information</h3>
      <p>We collect individually identifiable information from persons who wish
        to purchase products or subscribe to services via this Web site, in order
        to complete business transactions, deliver products and services, administer
        individual accounts, provide customer support, and meet government regulatory
        requirements. Unless you instruct us otherwise when you submit an order
        using our secure online server, we will add some or all of your contact
        information to our customer lists. From time to time, you may receive
        catalogs or e-mail notices from us describing publications we think may
        be of interest to you. We may also from time to time sell mailing lists
        (which would include your name and mailing address but not your e-mail
        address or telephone number) to others, or exchange such lists with others,
        as a result of which you may receive promotional materials from them.
        If you do not want to receive mailings from us or from those who use
        our mailing lists, please let us know by writing to the e-mail address
      or the postal address provided at the end of this notice.</p>
      <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
      <p>Information may be shared with contractors who directly support the
        Internet services we provide and who use the information only in accordance
        with this policy. In the normal course of business, we may share information
        with auditors, lawyers, or contractors, but we require that recipients
        use the information only for the purpose of the disclosure. When necessary
        or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court order
        or subpoena or when otherwise legally required. We may also disclose
        information if appropriate to protect our Web site or our legal rights,
        including but not limited to our right to enforce the Terms and Conditions
      of Use of this Web site.</p>
      <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>1. The transmission of data or information over the Internet
        is not secure and is subject to possible loss, interception, or alteration
        while in transit. The University of Chicago Press does not assume any
        liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as
        a result of any e-mail between you and us, or any transmissions between
        you and this Web site, including those that may contain your personal
      information.</p>
      <p>2. While we will take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard
        the privacy of personal information you provide us and to treat such
        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, in no event will
        your provision of such information be deemed to be in confidence, create
        any fiduciary duty to you on our part, or result in any liability to
        you on our part in the event that such information is inadvertently released
      by us or accessed by third parties without our consent.</p>
      <p>3. This Web site may contain links to other sites, but The University
        of Chicago Press is not responsible for the content or privacy practices
        of those sites.</p>
      <p>4. We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information
        from anyone under the age of thirteen without prior verifiable parental
        consent. If we become aware that a site visitor under the age of thirteen
        has provided personal information without prior verifiable parental consent,
        we will remove his or her personally identifiable information from our
        files. Please note that we may maintain a record of that person’s
        name and address in a “do not register” file to prevent subsequent
      registration of that minor.</p>
      <h3>Updates to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>The University of Chicago Press may from time to time review and revise
        this Privacy Policy. We will update the version number and effective
        date (see below) when we do. If we make a major change in the way that
        we use, disclose, or protect customer information, we will highlight
        the change in the policy.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about anything in this Privacy
        Policy, please feel free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@press.uchicago.edu">privacy@press.uchicago.edu</a>,
        or write to us at The University of Chicago Press, Attn: IS Department,
