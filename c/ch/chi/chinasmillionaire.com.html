                        information collection practices and of the ways in which your
                        information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so
                        please check back periodically to review this information.</p>



                    <p><b>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</b><br>
                        chinamillionaire typically receives specific data about its website
                        visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as
                        when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services,
                        open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for
                        employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these
                        activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a
                        purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or
                        request certain types of information. When you provide personally-
                        identifiable information to chinamillionaire through one of our
                        websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most
                        cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do
                        not, want chinamillionaire to use this information for additional
                        purposes. You may also request that chinamillionaire not use your
                        information by sending an e-mail to: support@chinamillionaire.com<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
                            /* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t="currentScript"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute("cf-hash"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute("data-cfemail");if(a){for(e="",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */</script>,

                        chinamillionaire services. Absent any instructions from you,
                        chinamillionaire may use information you provide to inform you about
                        additional services and products offered by the chinamillionaire family
                        of companies, chinamillionaire authorized agents, and other goods and
                        services providers with whom chinamillionaire has relationships and
                        whose offerings might be of interest to you. chinamillionaire will not,
                        however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless
                        we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of
                        imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those
                        chinamillionaire sites where you may provide chinamillionaire with
                        credit card or other ordering information via the web, chinamillionaire
                        protects and secures this information by employing commercially
                        customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of
                        which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic
                        Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any
                        feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the
                        like, chinamillionaire will treat that portion of the information as
                        non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed
                        in this privacy statement, chinamillionaire assumes no obligation to
                        protect such information from disclosure.

                        chinamillionaire sites visited. chinamillionaire gathers this
                        information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and
                        website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies,
                        including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to provide the
                        visitor with tailored information about chinamillionaire services).
                        chinamillionaire does not combine information collected in this way with

                        to chinamillionaire. chinamillionaire cannot protect any information you
                        may disclose in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy

                    <p><b>D. Exceptions and Limitations:</b><br>
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing and in compliance with applicable laws,
                        chinamillionaire (i) cooperates fully with state, local, and federal
                        officials in any investigation relating to any content (including
