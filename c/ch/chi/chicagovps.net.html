<h3>ChicagoVPS Privacy Policy</h3>
<p></p><p>Effective Date: Monday, September 9th, 2012.</p><p></p>
<h3>1. Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>
<p></p><p>Your privacy is important to ChicagoVPS. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Types of Information Collected</h3>
<p></p><p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.</p><p></p>
<h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>

By purchasing our services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate, complete and updated information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have ordered our services, we may be in communication with you about your account. These communications are essential to our relationship with you and to our ability to provide you with quality services that are responsive to your needs. As a result, we may maintain information about our communications with you for future use.</p><p></p>
<h3>2.1.1 Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personal Information to others. We do provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personal Information to operate our sites and to deliver our services.
