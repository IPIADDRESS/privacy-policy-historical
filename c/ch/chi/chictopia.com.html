<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the personal
	  information collected about users of the online dating service accessible
	  via the Website located at www.Chictopia.com and related URLs (the "Service")
	  and how such information may be used or disclosed by Chictopia.com, LLC. ("Chictopia").</p>
	<p>The term "You" (and its variants) refers to You as a user of
    the Service and the term "Us" (and its variants) refers to Chictopia. </p>
	<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
As part of the operation of the Service We collect and may disclose information
  about You. By accepting the Chictopia.com Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy,
  You consent to Our use and disclosure of Your personal information as described
  in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject
  to the terms of the Chictopia.com Terms of Use.</p>
	<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
	  We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages
	  of the Service. "Cookies" are small files placed on Your hard drive
	  that assist Us in providing customized services. Certain features of the Service
	  are only available with the use of a "cookie." We use this information
	  to determine Our members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
	  understand and serve You and other members. This information may include the
	  URL of the website that You visited prior to the Service (whether this URL
	  is on the Service or not), the URL of the website You next go to (whether
	  this URL is on the Service or not), what browser You are using and Your Internet
	  Protocol address. Most cookies are "session cookies" meaning that
	  they are automatically deleted from Your hard drive at the end of a session.
	  You are always free not to accept cookies if Your browser permits.</p>
	<p>We may use a third party advertising company to serve ads on Our behalf across
	  the Internet. That advertising company may also collect anonymous information
	  about Your visits to the Service. This is primarily accomplished through the
	  use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or
	  an action tag, which is placed on various Web pages within the Service or
	  in an HTML e-mail that allows the third party advertising company to collect
	  anonymous information. There may also be a number of services offered by external
	  service providers that help You use the Service. If You choose to use these
	  optional services and in doing so disclose information to the external service
	  providers or grant them permission to collect information about You, then
	  their use of Your information will be governed by their private policies,
	  if any.</p>
	<p><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong><br>
	  We use information in the data files We maintain about You, and the other
	    information We obtain from Your current and past activities on the Service
	    to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Our Terms of Use.
	    We may review the data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve
      disputes.</p>
	<p>We may use personally identifiable information about You to improve Our marketing
	  and promotional efforts, to analyze usage of the Service, improve Our content
	  and product offerings, and customize the Service content, layout, and features. </p>
	<p>We may use Your information to contact You and to deliver information to
	  You that may be targeted to Your interests, such as banner advertisements,
	  administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to
	  Your use of the Service. You agree to receive this information. If You do
	  not wish to receive this information, You may opt out of the receipt of certain
	  communications. To learn how to do so please go to the "Help" section
	  of the Service. </p>
	<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br>
	  Although we use industry-standard efforts to protect the personal information
	    We collect via the Service, we cannot guarantee that this information will
	    not be accessed by the government or third parties in certain circumstances.
	    We may be required by law to disclose information to the government, law
	    enforcement agencies or third parties. In addition, third parties
	    may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications
	    and members may abuse or misuse Your information that they collect from
	    the Service. Accordingly, You should not expect that Your personally identifiable
      information or private communications will remain private in all circumstances. </p>
	<p>We do not sell personally identifiable information about You to third parties
	  (provided that we may sell such information to a third party in connection
	  with an acquisition of all or part of our business). However, the following
	  describes some of the ways that Your personally identifiable information may
	  be used or disclosed.</p>
	<p>We aggregate personally identifiable information of Our members and disclose
	  such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and
	  other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. We do not disclose
	  to these entities any information that could be used to identify You personally.
	  We do not disclose certain information, such as Your name, email address,
	  password, credit card number and bank account number, to marketing advertisers.
	  We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on Our behalf. These
	  companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. </p>
	<p>We may require that you submit certain financial information, including Your
	  credit card billing information. We will use this information to bill You
	  for use of Our Services and products. By making a purchase, or engaging in
	  any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information
	  on the Service, You consent to Our providing Your financial information to
	  Our service providers and to such third parties as We determine necessary
	  to support and process Your transactions. These third parties may include
	  the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process and support
	  Your transactions. By purchasing, or registering for, or making reservations
	  for products or services of third parties offered on the Service, or by participating
	  in programs offered on the Service that are administered by third parties
	  and that require You to submit financial information in order to use them,
	  You consent to Our providing Your financial information to those third parties.
	  These third parties will be authorized to use Your financial information in
	  accordance with Our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in
	  accordance with their own privacy policies, over which We have no control,
	  and You agree that We are not responsible or liable for any of their actions
	  or omissions. </p>
	<p>We may share data collected via the Service, including personally identifiable
	  information about You, with Our parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries. Our parent,
	  affiliates and subsidiaries will follow privacy practices no less protective
	  of such personal information than Our practices described in this Privacy
	  Policy. It is possible that We could merge with or be acquired by another
	  business entity. Should such merger or acquisition occur, We would share some
	  or all of Your personal information with the merger partner or acquiring party.
	  The acquiring entity or newly combined entity will follow the practices disclosed
	  in this Privacy Policy with respect to such information. </p>
	<p>We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries and with third parties to enforce
	  laws. You authorize Us to disclose any information about You to law enforcement
	  and other government officials as We in Our sole discretion believe necessary
	  or appropriate in connection with any investigation of fraud or other activity
	  that is illegal or may expose Us or You to liability. </p>
	<p><strong>Your Use of Other Members' Information</strong><br>
	  Our services may include access to instant messaging and chat rooms. As
	    a member You have access to members' identification numbers or user names
	    and You might gain access to other contact information of other members
	    through the use of the Service. You may not use such information in
	    any manner that is not authorized by Us and the applicable member. In all
	    cases, You must give members an opportunity to remove their information
	    from Your information databases, including email lists. Under no circumstances
	    may You disclose personally identifiable information about another member
	    to any third party without Our consent and the consent of such other member.
	    You may not add a member to an mail list (email or physical mail) without
      that member's express consent. </p>
	<p><strong>Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Profile</strong><br>
	  After registration You can review the information You submitted
	    during registration. For instructions on how to change the information, contact info@chictopia.com. </p>
	<p>We may retain in Our
	  files information You have requested be removed from Our active databases
	  for certain purposes, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and
	  enforce the Terms of Use. Moreover, such prior information may never be completely
	  removed from Our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including
	  stored 'back up' systems. You should not expect that all of Your personally
	  identifiable information will be completely removed from Our databases in
	  response to Your request.</p>
	<p><strong>Control of Your Password</strong><br>
	  You are responsible for all actions taken with Your login information and
	    password, including any fees or charges incurred based on such use. If You
	    choose to share this information with a third party, You are responsible
	    for all actions taken with Your login information and password by such third
	    party. If You believe your password has been disclosed to third parties
      or otherwise compromised in any way You should immediately change Your password.</p>
	<p><strong>Third Party Use of Information</strong><br>
	  This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information
	    We collect from You. If You disclose Your personal information to
	    other parties, whether via the Service or on other sites throughout the
	    Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information
	    You disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of any third
	    parties so You should investigate their policies before You disclose Your
      personal information to them.</p>
	<p><strong>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</strong><br>
	  We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time based on changes in
	    the law, Your comments, or Our need to accurately reflect Our data collection
	    and disclosure practices. We will notify you of such revisions and
	    such revisions shall become effective in accordance with the procedures
    for revising the Terms of Use. </p>
