        Chicory Privacy Policy<br>
        <small>Last revised: September 2013</small>
      </h1>
      <p>At Chicory weâ€™ve created this Privacy Policy in order to
        detail how information you provide us is used and shared.</p>

      <p>By visiting our Website, accessing any Chicory platforms,
        and/or using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy
        Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.</p>

      <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Personal Information</h3>

          <p>When you visit our website (www.chicoryapp.com; known as the
            "Website") or any other Chicory platforms or technology
            including but not limited to Chicory blogs and the Chicory "order
            ingredients" and "save recipe" buttons (known as the "Chicory Recipe
            Widget") on partnered sites we collect personal information about
            you including, but not limited to, name, email address, and any
            information associated with your Facebook or Twitter profiles if you
            have created a Chicory account with social login (collectively the
            "Personal Information").</p>

      <h3>Billing Information</h3>

          <p>All transactions are processed by our partnered online grocers.&nbsp; We
            do not collect, store, or maintain any Billing Information.&nbsp;
            Instead, it is collected and processed through our partnered online
            grocers pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy
            policies and terms of use.</p>

      <h3>Your Activity</h3>

          <p>Information that we automatically collect when you visit the afore
            mentioned websites or use any Chicory platforms or
            technology, such as your IP addresses, browser type and language,
            referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time
            spent on particular pages, pages visited, order information, and
            similar information concerning your use of any and all Chicory platforms
            and technology including but not limited to the Website, blogs, and
            Chicory Recipe Widget. This information enables us:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</li>
            <li>To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to
              customize our site according to your individual interests.
            </li>
            <li>To speed up your searches.</li>
            <li>To recognize you when you return to our site.</li>
            <li>To create products and information based on customer usability
              testing and demand
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h2>How We Use and Share the Information</h2>

      <p>We use the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the
        Information from Your Activity to provide you services; solicit your
        feedback; inform you about our products, services, upcoming events,
        recipes, and special promotions and those of our third-party marketing
        partners; administer and process contests, promotions, and sweepstakes;
        improve our services to you; contact you directly (either through email
        or phone) for problems that occur when using our services.&nbsp; Also, we may
        share the information we collect as described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on
          our behalf.&nbsp; Examples include food services, delivery services,
          marketing assistance, information technology support, and customer
          service. &nbsp;These other companies will have access to the Personal
          Information, the Billing Information, and other information we might
          collect (collectively the Other Information), only as necessary to
          perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.
        </li>
        <li>In order to administer our contests, promotions, and sweepstakes, we
          may share your Personal Information and Other Information with our
          third-party promotional and marketing partners.
        </li>
        <li>In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our
          Services, we might analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in
          order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Services. &nbsp;This
          aggregate information does not identify you personally. &nbsp;We may share
          this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business
          partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to
          describe our products and Services to current and prospective business
          partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
        </li>
        <li>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or
          assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization,
          dissolution, or similar event, the Personal Information, the Billing
          Information, and the Other Information may be part of the transferred
          assets.
        </li>
        <li>To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal
          Information, the Billing Information, and the Other Information when
          required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement
          authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing
          the such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to
          protect the rights, property, or safety of Chicory or
          others.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

      <p>We take appropriate security steps to protect the information we
        collect for you from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
        alteration, or destruction. &nbsp;However, no security system is immune to
        problems. &nbsp;We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we
        guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while
        being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular,
        e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should
        therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us
        via e-mail.</p>

      <h2>Offline Collection, Use &amp; Disclosure of Information</h2>

      <p>In addition to the information we collect online, there is information
        that we will collect offline in certain instances. Such information can
        be collected at Chicory events, Chicory sponsored events, or Chicory
        solicitations.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>

      <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under
        the age of 13 through the Services. &nbsp;If you are under 13, please do not
        give us any Personal Information. &nbsp;We encourage parents and legal
        guardians to monitor their childrenâ€™s Internet usage and to help enforce
        our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide
        Personal Information through the Services without their permission. &nbsp;If
        you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
        Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to
        delete that information from our databases.</p>

      <h2>External Websites</h2>

      <p>The Platform may contain links to third-party websites.&nbsp; Chicory
          has no control over the privacy practices or the content of any
        of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or other websites to
        which we provide links; we especially have no control over any recipe
        websites that Chicory platforms or technology work with.
        Therefore, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy
        policies of those third-party websites.&nbsp; You should check the applicable
        third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other
        websites.</p>

      <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 2013.&nbsp; We may regularly
        change this Privacy Policy and will alert users to changes as
        necessary.&nbsp; Visits to our sites, use any Chicory platforms,
        or use of our services subsequent to Privacy Policy changes is deemed to
        be your acceptance of the new changes. Please refer back to this Privacy
        Policy on a regular basis.</p>
