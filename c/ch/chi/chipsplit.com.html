			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Information Collected.</b><br>
				We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, credit card information, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be "Personal Information."

The Personal Information that we collect may include: contact information, shipping information, billing information, transaction history, web site usage preferences, and feedback regarding our products and services. In addition, when you interact with the Service, our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects the information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, and type of browser used. This is not considered Personal Information. In general, you can visit the ChipSplit.com website without telling us who you are and without revealing any Personal Information about yourself. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Service unless you voluntarily provide it to us.<br></li>
				<li><b>Means of Collecting &amp; Processing Data.</b><br>
				We may automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal Information about you where you provide such information through the Service or other communications and interactions with ChipSplit.com. We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors and service providers that refer you to the ChipSplit.com website. In addition, we may engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support,, process your online transactions and maintain your online accounts. We will have access to any information you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services so that we can process your transactions, maintain your accounts, meet certain business requirements and provide you with promotional offers and information regarding ChipSplit.com and our products and services. We use this Personal Information to process your transactions and support your use of the Service. Subject to clauses 3 &amp; 4 below.

Your Personal Information may also be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents for technical support and to process transactions you initiate on the Service and deliver the products and services you purchase. From time-to-time, we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). By accepting any contest prize or winnings from us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law.

				<li><b>Certain Excluded Disclosures.</b><br>

				We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that you provide to a third-party website that links to or from the ChipSplit.com website or any information collected by any third party administering our affiliate program or any other program, since these third-party websites are owned and operated independent of us.
