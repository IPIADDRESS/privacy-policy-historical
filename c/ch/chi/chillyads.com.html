The primary goal of ChillyAds Classifieds in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience and to assist your navigation throughout ChillyAds Classifieds. <br> 
<br> 
When you are asked for personal information on Chilly Ads Classifieds, you are sharing that information with "ChillyAds Classified Ads" Classifieds alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However, some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal information being revealed to other users of "ChillyAds Classifieds. For example, when you enter personal information on the ad posting form, this information will generally be included in your ad, unless specifically stated otherwise. <br>

<b>With whom your information may be shared:</b><br> 
 <br> 
Other than information displayed as part of your profile, as a general rule, "ChillyAds" Classifieds will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared.<br> 
 <br> 
<b>Policy Updates:</b><br> 
 <br> 
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.<br>
