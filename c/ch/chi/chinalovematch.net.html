<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px">
<div>a. Third parties engaged by CLM.NET to perform functions on its behalf, such as processing credit card information, mail outs, debt collection, marketing, research and advertising</div>
<div>b. Third parties authorized by you to receive information held by CLM.NET</div>
<div>c. Other third parties, as required by law</div>
</blockquote>
<h3>CLM.NET storage and security of personal information:</h3>
<div>1. All information is stored on the CLM.NET systems. Safeguards including physical, technical (firewalls, SSL encryptions etc) and procedural methods are used to protect this data.</div>
<div>2. You can update your contact and profile information at any time by logging onto CLM.NET website and following the appropriate links.</div>
<div>3. Communications with other members are deleted from our systems on a regular basis.</div>
<div>4. Other personal information provided voluntarily by you in response to surveys, competitions etc is deleted on a regular basis as soon as possible after the end of the event.</div>

<h3>Accessing personal information CLM.NET holds about you:</h3>
<div>1. You can access all the contact and profile information we hold about you at any time, simply by logging on to the CLM.NET site. If you have forgotten your login details, <a href="http://www.chinalovematch.net/getpassword.asp"><strong>click here</strong></a> to have your password sent to you.</div>
<div>2. If you would like to know what other information we hold about you, please contact us by email at <u><a href="mailto:service@chinalovematch.net">service@chinalovematch.net</a></u>.&nbsp; Please include your CLM.NET username and tell us the email address on your CLM.NET account</div>
<h3>In case of a question, problem or complaint about our use of your personal information</h3>
<div>Please contact us in any of the following ways by email at <u><a href="mailto:service@chinalovematch.net">service@chinalovematch.net</a></u>.&nbsp; Please include your CLM.NET username and the email address on your CLM.NET account.</div>
<h3>CLM.NET 'cookie' policy</h3>
<div>As a default, we use a feature of your browser called a 'cookie' to assign a user ID. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from the site you are visiting and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are very common and completely normal throughout the Internet. Cookies do not harm your computer nor can they access information stored on your computer. The primary purpose of cookies is to maintain your customized settings on a site. Members that do not accept cookies will be able to log on to the site, but profile identifying information will appear in browser URLs and may compromise account security.</div>
<h3>Balancing Members’ Privacy Needs and Rights:</h3>
<div>1. Please note that as a general policy, CLM.NET does not review the content of private e-mail messages or screen the Profiles posted by CLM.NET members (although it may periodically review the information posted in the public areas of the service) and accepts no responsibility for resolving disputes between members.</div>
<div>2. CLM.NET receives communications from members concerning other members. These may be testimonials, complaints or general information. CLM.NET aims to be as open as possible with all its members, without compromising the privacy of any individuals.</div>
<div>3. If you complain about another member, we may advise that member that a complaint about him / her has been received. However, we will not tell the member who made the complaint without your express permission. Further, if we suspect that the member would be able to identify who made the complaint, we will not advise that a complaint has been made unless we have your express permission.</div>
<div>4. When a complaint about a member is received, no action will be taken unless the complaint is substantiated by evidence. However, a record of the complaint may be made and included in the data held about that member.</div>
<div>5. Communications between two members will be released to either member on request. They will not be released to third parties.</div>
<div>6. If another member has written 'private notes' about you, CLM.NET considers that those notes were written for that member's use only, and to display them to others would be a violation of that member's privacy. Those notes will not as a rule be released to you, even if you request all information held by CLM.NET about you.</div>
<h3>&nbsp;CLM.NET staff use of and access to information;</h3>
<div>CLM.NET employees and contractors may also be members of the site, and their employment may give them access to information not generally available to other members of CLM.NET or the general public.</div>
<div><strong>The following code governs the behaviour of CLM.NET employees and contractors:</strong></div>
<div>1. They will not use personal contact information or other personal information held by CLM.NET for any purpose other than the performance of their jobs and/or contracts.</div>
<div>2. They may not post profiles, and under no circumstances may they contact CLM.NET Members except for the express purpose of performing their employment and/or contract duties.</div>
