							  Welcome to ChineseMenu.com! We want you to know that we respect the privacy of our customers. We have developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of ChineseMenu.com and our services, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. This Privacy Policy also applies to transactions made, and data gathered, by ChineseMenu.com's telephone call centers in connection with associated goods and services. All information you provide to our call centers will only be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This policy describes circumstances in which your use of ChineseMenu.com or our services constitutes your consent for the collection, use and disclosure of your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, as well as other circumstances where your express consent will be obtained. This Privacy Policy is directed towards consumers rather than businesses and is not intended to cover information about businesses or business purpose activities. 
							  </p>
<p>
							  We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our website or services or transacting business with us. By using our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

							  We only collect, use and/or disclose your personal information with your consent. We will ask you for your express consent if you would like to receive offers and/or information from us and/or an event provider. In addition, this Privacy Policy identifies various purposes for which personal information you provide us will be used, such as processing the transaction you requested, processing payment, and preventing fraud.

<p>
							  In General. Information that we collect from you, either online or through our call centers or retail outlets, can generally be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable. Anonymous information is information that is not identified with a specific individual, such as the type of browser being used and what web pages have been accessed. Personally identifiable information ("personal information") is information that you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, user name and passwords. Unless we specifically tell you we are doing so, we do not associate the anonymous information we collect with your personal information. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in Canada, the United States and other countries around the world.

You also may provide information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information. We may also collect anonymous information about you which is described later in this policy.

<h2><span><a name="a5" class="ale">Your choices about collection and use of your information</a><a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a></span></h2>
<p>
							  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to open a My ChineseMenu.com account; purchase products or services; participate in a promotion or survey; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website. 
							  </p>
<p>
							  At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” button and following the instructions to manage your e-mail alerts. When you provide your email address on our website, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive e-mail messages about promotions or special offers from ChineseMenu.com or from third parties to whom we send your information (such as event providers). You may modify your choices with regard to receiving communications from ChineseMenu.com at any time in your My ChineseMenu.com account. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. Please note that changing information in your My ChineseMenu.com account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications, will only affect future activities or communications from ChineseMenu.com. If we have already provided your information to an event provider or another third party with your consent before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party. Moreover, please understand that in the event you elect to opt-out of providing your personal information or permitting us to share it with third parties, and later accept an offer from one of our third party marketing partners, we will share your personal information with that specific third party. 
You will not have the ability to opt-out of receiving transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as event cancellations and other service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys relating to ticket purchases (although your participation in a survey is completely voluntary).

<h2><span><a name="a6" class="ale">With whom we share your information</a><a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a></span></h2>
<p>
							  We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or anonymous information we have collected about you or your activities on our web site or while using our services. 
							  </p>
<p>
							  Personal information. We do not share your personal information with others except with your consent 
							  </p>
<p>
							  Authorized service providers. We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. We require all of our service providers to comply with the safeguards described in this policy.
							  </p>
<p>
							  Business partners. With your consent, we may also share your personal information with businesses with which we partner to offer you products, services, promotions, contests through our website or our services.

When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address, billing and other information relevant to the offer or program to that merchant. These businesses may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you want to learn about a particular merchant's privacy policies, or you do not want to receive communications from a particular merchant, then you must contact that merchant directly. Your personal information is only provided to those businesses whose offers you elect to participate in and not to other businesses advertising on our website. 
							  </p>
<p>
							  Other Situations. By using our services and providing us with your personal information, you consent to our disclosure of your personal information in the following circumstances: 
							  </p>
<p>
							  In response to legal requirements, including in response to a subpoena, a court order, or a request from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; and to defend against legal claims.

							  In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may only use and disclose your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy unless you otherwise consent. 
							  </p>
<h2><span><a name="a7" class="ale">Third-party websites</a>
<a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a></span></h2>
<p>
							  There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. 
							  </p>
<h2><span><a name="a8" class="ale">How you can access your information</a><a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a>

							  </p>
<h2><span><a name="a9" class="ale">Retention policy</a><a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a></span></h2>
<p>
							  If you close your My ChineseMenu.com account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to event providers or to other third parties with your consent, the use and retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. ChineseMenu.com has implemented a retention policy to prevent personal information from being retained for a period that is longer than reasonably necessary to deliver the products and/or services purchased using ChineseMenu.com's services.
							  </p>
<h2><span><a name="a10" class="ale">How we protect your personal information</a><a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a></span></h2>
<p>
							  We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only to the extent such access is required for permitted business functions. We require our authorized service providers to protect your personal information in a similar fashion. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. We communicate your personal information to event providers and authorized service providers using secure connections. 
							  </p>
<p>
							  Although we take appropriate security measures as required by law, no security is perfect. Users should always take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. 
							  </p>
<h2><span><a name="a11" class="ale">Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms</a>
<a href="#top" class="atop">Top</a></span></h2>
<p>
							  We may provide areas on our website where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
