            you have opted to receive or not to receive.</p>
          <p><b>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</b></p>
          <p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on 
            the Website, including but not limited to those described below:</p> 
          <p><b>Registration:</b> You may be asked to complete a registration 
            form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also 
            be asked to chose a user ID and password in order to take advantage 
            of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters 
            or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will 
            have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information 
            to the Website.</p> 
          <p><b>Newsletters and Website Emails:</b> We offer free newsletters 
            to share information with you about the Website, about us and our 
            affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers 
            and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for 
            a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or 
            membership for which you have registered on the Website. Participation 
            is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or 
            not to disclose information to the Website. You may also cancel your 
            free email subscription by emailing <a href="mailto:fanservices@chicagobears.com">fanservices@chicagobears.com</a> 
            or by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the 
            newsletter or email.</p>
          <p><b>Contests or Sweepstakes:</b> We periodically operate contests 
            and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration 
            or the submission of personal information. Participation is voluntary 
            and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose 
            information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information 
            may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery 
            confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest 
            for details about how your personal information will be used).</p>
          <p>We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some 
            of your information on the Website, such as on a winner's page, in 
            the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by 
            applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. 
            In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate 
            or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your 
            information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host 
            of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information 
            and we have no control over the information collected from you. Accordingly, 
            we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy 
            applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.</p>
          <p><b>Surveys or Voting:</b> From time-to-time we may request personally 
            identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or 
            voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity 
            to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.</p>
          <p><b>Games:</b> When you register to play games or trivia on our Website, 
            you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><b>Cookies:</b> As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology 
            called "cookies." A cookie is a unique, random number that 
            is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually 
            identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site.</p>
          <p>Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever 
            your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know 
            how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. 
            In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, 
            like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered 
            users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving 
            information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how 
            and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas 
            are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the 
            Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies 
            allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on 
            the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you 
            advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information 
            collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain 
            an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any 
            time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with 
            a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. 
            Cookies, log files and web-beacons are not tied to a user's personally 
            identifiable information</p>
          <p>Some of our business partners, sponsors or advertisers, use cookies 
            on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
          <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by <a href="http://www.ChicagoBears.com">www.ChicagoBears.com</a> 
            only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>
          <p><b>Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology:</b> Our Website uses 
            a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web 
            beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in 
            images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods 
            to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency 
            with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical 
            methods may involve the transmission of information either directly 
            to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information 
            on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails 
            that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened 
            those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information 
            from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that 
            is personally identifiable.</p>
          <p><b>IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data:</b> We may collect IP addresses 
            and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with 
            the service through which you access the internet, like your ISP (Internet 
            Service Provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, 
            your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also 
            use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report 
            aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example 
            regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts 
            of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable 
            information. Click-stream data is information as the page served, 
            the time, the source of the request, and other such non-personal information. 
            When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the 
            Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors 
            in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and 
            advertising, and the like.</p>
          <p><b>Transaction Information:</b> If you conduct a financial transaction 
            with our Website, such as order information from our Website, buy 
            our merchandise, or subscribe to services offered on our Website, 
            we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain 
            information from you, including contact information, demographic information 
            and financial information. We will use this information to complete 
            the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, 
            products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. For 
            your protection, such information is collected and stored through 
            encrypted means.</p>
          <p><b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</b></p>
          <p>As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:</p>
