	 <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHIDE.IT knows that you care about how your personal information  is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the  following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the CHIDE.IT  website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers CHIDE.IT's treatment of personal  information that CHIDE.IT gathers when you are on the CHIDE.IT website and when  you use CHIDE.IT services.<br>
  This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that CHIDE.IT  does not own or control, or to individuals that CHIDE.IT does not employ or  manage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Personal Information About Users Does CHIDE.IT Collect?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to  provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We only  collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. We  do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose  for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We collect  the following types of information from our users:</p>
<p><strong><em>1) Information You Provide to       Us</em></strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide       to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain       information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our       special features. The personal information you provide is used for such       purposes as: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Registration: In order        for you to use CHIDE.IT services, such as submitting new links to the        website, you must complete a registration form. <br>  
  <br>  
</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Automatic Information: </strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;We receive and store        certain types of information whenever you interact with us. CHIDE.IT        automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on        our server logs from your browser including your IP address, CHIDE.IT        cookie information, and the page you requested. CHIDE.IT uses this        traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends        and administer the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;CHIDE.IT may also add        on any page display the total counts that page has been viewed. This        includes member profile pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Social sharing of        data: CHIDE.IT allows other users to browse stories that you have chided,        submitted, or commented on. This information is made available via your        member profile or within the permalink URL of the story in which you        performed the action on. CHIDE.IT may choose to post this data on other        site features in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Profile information:        CHIDE.IT allows other users to browse your full name and location within your member profile should you provide this        optional information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Syndication: CHIDE.IT        allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the        website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;API: CHIDE.IT will        allow 3rd parties access to all CHIDE.IT data. This is already publicly        available through CHIDE.IT. CHIDE.IT will forever keep private passwords        and blog settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Many companies offer        programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While CHIDE.IT will        not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot        recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Cookies are alphanumeric       identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your       Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us       how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.       CHIDE.IT cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not       combine information collected through cookies with other personal       information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email       address is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;The "help" portion       of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to       prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the       browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable       cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated,       however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of       CHIDE.IT's most attractive features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Some of our business partners       may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we       have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Will CHIDE.IT Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information about our users is an integral part of our business.  We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your  personal information only as described below.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>=&gt;CHIDE.IT Personnel:</strong> <br>
  CHIDE.IT personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants       and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out       their duties in the normal course of CHIDE.IT business. <br>  
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>=&gt;Business Transfers:</strong> <br>
  In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of       transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets       that is transferred. Moreover, if CHIDE.IT, or substantially all of its       assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is       transferred.<br>  
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>=&gt;Protection of       CHIDE.IT and Others:</strong><br>
  We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that       release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our       conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,       or safety of CHIDE.IT, our employees, our users, or others. This includes       exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud       protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>=&gt;With Your Consent:</strong><br>
  Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal       information may be shared with third parties or used for a purpose       incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected,       and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information by opting       out.<br>  
  <br>
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Is Information About Me Secure?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;Your CHIDE.IT account       information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You       need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and       to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared       computer.<br>  
  <br>
</p>
<p>=&gt;Only employees who need       personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer       service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are       kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>What Information Can I Access?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;You can access your personal information on our website and  correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate. </p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;As stated previously, you can       always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use       certain features on our website, such as posting new links.<br>  
  <br>
</p>
<p>=&gt;You are able to add or update       certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What       Personal Information About Users Does CHIDE.IT Collect?" section       above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of       the unrevised information in our records.<br>  
  <br>
</p>
<p>=&gt;You may request deletion of       your CHIDE.IT account by emailing us at support -at - CHIDE - dot -IT.<br>  
  <br>
</p>
<p>=&gt;As explained earlier, the       "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will       direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how       to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how       to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does       not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our       attractive features.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Can Children Use CHIDE.IT's Services?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;You must be 13 years and older to register to use the CHIDE.IT  website. As a result, CHIDE.IT does not specifically collect information about  children.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;CHIDE.IT may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its  sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy  Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to  the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the  CHIDE.IT website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we  use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Conditions of Use</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;If you decide to visit CHIDE.IT website, your visit and any  possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms  of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and  application of law of CHIDE.IT’s place of incorpration.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Effective Date of this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt;This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1st, 2008. </p>
