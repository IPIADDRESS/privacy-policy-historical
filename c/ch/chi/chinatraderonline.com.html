      <p>
      <strong>YOUR PRIVACY   RIGHTS</strong>
      </p><p>The following policy explains our   information gathering and dissemination practices. </p>
      <p><strong>Information   Collected</strong></p>
      <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Personally Identifiable   Information Collected by Chinatraderonline.com<br>
          <br>
        When you register as a new user with   the Chinatraderonline.com Web site (the “Site”), our registration form may require you to   give us certain information such as your first and last name, email address,   date of birth, and zip code. Chinatraderonline.com will also collect other information you   volunteer to us through use of our service that can identify you as a specific   individual. We refer to this information as Personally Identifiable Information   (“PII”). You may always choose not to provide PII, however, this may limit our   ability to provide you with a specific service or particular information. We may   also collect demographic and other data, which may include PII, generally   through surveys and forms which you may or may not choose to participate in. If   you place an order for goods on Chinatraderonline.com or through a Chinatraderonline.com Partner, you   may be required to enter your credit card number and information, as well as   your shipping address and/or other contact information.</p>
      <p>Reviews of products ideas and   merchants will display PII of those users who have posted such reviews, as will   public products lists. The PII displayed on user postings will be limited to first   name and initial of last name.</p>
      <p>2. products Recipients’ Personally   Identifiable Information Added by Users<br>
          <br>
        Once registered, a user will be   able to create profiles for friends and family or any other products recipients. In   order to save such profiles in an account, the user will be required to enter   some PII for the products recipient such as the products recipient’s name, birth date,   gender, and their relationship to the user. This information is stored on the My   products Lists and Saved Profiles area of the user’s Chinatraderonline.com account. As such, any   user should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to entering their   information on the Site. Chinatraderonline.com respects the privacy of the products recipients   entered into our system and will not share any PII of products recipients with third   parties other than for the purposes enumerated under Use of products Recipient’s   Personally Identifiable Information by Chinatraderonline.com   below.<br>
      </p>
      <p>3. Personally Identifiable   Information Collected by Chinatraderonline.com Business Partners<br>
          <br>
        Chinatraderonline.com works with   third-party advertising companies, sponsors and other companies with whom we do   business (“Business Partners”) to place advertising on our site and in email   communications sent to our registered users and other communications related to   the Chinatraderonline.com service. In order to complete a transaction, Business Partners may   collect PII of a products recipient on their respective Web site. Such collection of   PII is governed by that Business Partner’s privacy policy. <br>
        <br>
        Chinatraderonline.com may   correlate or match registered users' information, including PII, with   information held by our Business Partners to target ads or otherwise improve the   effectiveness of our service. Our Business Partners may read or set cookies on   your hard drive, use pixel tags, track which ads you have viewed, or collect   other information about you.<br>
        <br>
        From time to time, Chinatraderonline.com may also have   special offers or promotions that are sponsored by a Business Partner. In order   to participate in these offers, you may be required to follow a separate   registration process. If you consent to receive information from a Business   Partner through an opt-in or opt-out process Chinatraderonline.com may pass your information   to such Business Partner.<br>
        <br>
        Chinatraderonline.com may also offer goods or services for   purchase available by our Business Partners by way of email communications to   our users. If you purchase goods or services offered through Chinatraderonline.com by a   Business Partner, then you may be required to submit PII in order to complete   the transaction and Chinatraderonline.com may provide your PII to such Business Partner for   that purpose.<br>

        In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship   with a Business Partner in which we prominently display their brand name or   trademarks on pages that appear the same as or very similar to the pages of the   Chinatraderonline.com service. These pages are known as "Co-Branded Pages" and these   particular Business Partners are known as “Co-Branded Business Partners.” If the   page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by   clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share your personal   information with the associated Co-Branded Business Partner. Co-Branded Business   Partners may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy   policies. Chinatraderonline.com disclaims all liability for the privacy policies and   procedures on any Business Partner or Co-Branded Business Partner Web site. You   will need to contact the Co-Branded Business Partner to instruct them directly   regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.   Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so   submitted to such Co-Branded Business Partners in the same manner in which we   are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us (see Use   of your PII by Business Partners below). <br>
