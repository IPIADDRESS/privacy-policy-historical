        <b>Chi Health Privacy Policy</b></p>
    <p>
        Chi Health understands how important the privacy of personal information is to our
        users. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and
        about your use of Chi Health and its services. It will explain the choices you have
        about how your personal information is used and how we protect that information.
        We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites owned and operated by Chi Health that are
        intended for use by consumers (non-professionals) for non-commercial personal, family
        or household purposes, including ChiHealth.in, StepUpToLife.com, and others including
        the mobile optimized versions of these sites (we refer to these sites collectively
        as the "Chi Health Web Sites"). However, if you are an employee or health plan member
        who has enabled access to your health record at ChiHealth.in by registering at your
        employer’s or health plan’s website, the privacy policy applicable to your information
        at your employer’s or health plan’s website remains applicable to your personal
        health record at ChiHealth.in. If your employer or health plan account is no longer
        made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to have
        access to your health information from ChiHealth.in, using the same username and
        password, but will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Except where noted, statements
        in this Privacy Policy with respect to the Chi Health Web Sites also apply to the
        Chi Health Mobile Device Application (or "App") for the iOS, Android, Windows and
        Blackberry operating systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        References to "Chi Health" mean Chi Health and Workplace Wellness Solutions Pvt.
        Ltd., including any company that it controls. Chi Health may share information among
        its subsidiaries or group companies or web sites that it owns or controls, but information
        collected under this Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this
        Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Information Collected About You</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>Personal Information</b></p>
    <p>
        If you choose to register or update an existing member profile with Chi Health or
        access certain functionality on the Chi Health Web Sites, you may be required to
        submit Personal Information. "Personal Information" means information that we can
        use to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number or
        email address. Some of our interactive tools and services may request you to submit
        health information, which would also be considered Personal Information. You are
        responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information that you submit
        to Chi Health. Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the
        Chi Health Web Sites and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this
        Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Registration</b></p>
    <p>
        Access to some Chi Health interactive tools and services may be limited to users
        who have registered. Some of our tools (such as certain quizzes or calculators)
        do not retain your Personal Information, while others store your Personal Information
        in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the authorization you provide at the
        time you submit Personal Information in order to use the tool. Chi Health Personal
        Health Records, which allows you a secure place to gather, store, manage and share
        your Personal Information and provides tools and services to better manage your
        health and the health of your family, requires additional registration. It has the
        ability to use Personal Information that you provide to send you personalized emails
        or secure electronic messages. However, Chi Health does not allow any third parties
        to place beacons or cookies or to gather any data about you in connection with your
        use of the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Newsletters &amp; Emails to You</b></p>
    <p>

        be given the option of providing us with Personal Information in order to receive
        recurring informational/promotional newsletters – such as a newsletter relating
        to a specific health condition – via email from Chi Health and/or directly from
        third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you sign up for our email newsletters or at any time, you can choose to opt
        out of receiving additional promotional newsletters from Chi Health or our Sponsors.

        <b>Market Research</b></p>
    <p>
        From time to time, Chi Health may conduct online research surveys through email
        invitations, pop–up surveys and online focus groups. When participating in a survey,
        we may ask you to enter Personal Information. The Personal Information you submit
        in a survey may be used by Chi Health for research and measurement purposes, as
        described below, including measurement of the effectiveness of content, advertising
        or programs. When our market research surveys collect Personal Information we will
        not knowingly accept participants who are under the age of 13. Market research surveys
        conducted by or on behalf of Chi Health will contain a link to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Community, Health Communities, Blogs and Other Public Forums</b></p>
    <p>
        Chi Health features several community areas and other public forums where users
        with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one
        another or where users can post questions for experts to answer. We also offer online
        discussions moderated by healthcare experts. Our communities are open to the public
        and should not be considered private.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Any information (including Personal Information) you share in any online community
            area including a chat room, Health Community, Ask Our Expert posting or online discussion
            is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before
            posting any Personal Information in any public forum. What you post can be seen,
            disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we
            cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As
            with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in
            third-party search engines.</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>If you mistakenly post Personal Information in our Community areas and would like
            it removed, you can send us an email to request that we remove it by using the <i>Contact
                Us</i> link on the Chi Health Web Sites. In some cases, we may not be able to
            remove your Personal Information. If your Personal information has been seen by
            any entity prior to us removing it, Chi Health will not be responsible for the same.</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>Emails You Send to Chi Health</b></p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information,
        ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to Chi Health by email. If you want
        to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or
        proprietary, do not send them in an email to Chi Health.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Non-Personal Information </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if you do not register with or provide any Personal Information to Chi Health,
        we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Chi Health Web Sites.
        "Non-Personal Information" means information that we cannot use to identify or contact
        you. We may also acquire Non-Personal Information about our users from external
        sources. While you may use some of the functionality of Chi Health without registration,
        many of the specific tools and services on the Chi Health Web Sites require that
        you register with Chi Health.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Cookies and Web Beacons </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Chi Health Web Sites and
        your use of other web sites through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons. "Cookies"
        are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to
        view a web site. Every computer that accesses the Chi Health Web Sites is assigned
        a different cookie by Chi Health. "Web Beacons" are graphic image files imbedded
        in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to
        its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some
        other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL
        of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the
        site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that
        server.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third parties under contract with Chi Health may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect
        Non-Personal Information about your usage of the Chi Health Web Sites, including
        which health topics you have viewed. These third party advertising service providers
        may use this information, on our behalf, to help Chi Health deliver advertising
        on the Chi Health Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your
        browsing activity on our sites. Chi Health may further tailor the advertising on
        these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent
        known by Chi Health or these third parties.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Mobile Device Applications ("Apps")</b></p>
    <p>
        When you download and install one of our Chi Health Mobile Apps onto your mobile
        device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be
        used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you
        choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner
        similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies,
        the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser,
        because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number
        cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number
        for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App,
        and please use your mobile device browser to access the Chi Health Web Sites or
        our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device,
        other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device
        uses. Please note that certain Chi Health Mobile Apps require registration either
        to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Chi Health’s Behalf</b></p>
    <p>
        We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and
        preferences of our user community. Sponsors or advertisers on the Chi Health Web
        Sites may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies
        in the banner advertisements served on the Chi Health Web Sites and in emails, special
        promotions or newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may be displayed on
        the Chi Health Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the Chi
        Health Web Sites. Some advertisers use companies other than Chi Health to serve
        their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers")
        may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons
        on the Chi Health Web Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage
        the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on
        the Chi Health Web Sites.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>With Whom Do We Share Your Information?</b></p>
    <p>
        Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you,
        Chi Health will not disclose any Personal Information it gathers from you through

        Chi Health reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to the new party
        in control or the party acquiring assets. In the event of such a change, your Personal
        Information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless
        any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the section below
        that discusses "Changes to This Privacy Policy."</p>
    <p>
        <b>Disclosures to Chi Health Operations and Maintenance Contractor</b></p>
    <p>
        Chi Health contractors sometimes have limited access to your Personal and Non-Personal
        Information in the course of providing products or services to Chi Health. These
        contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services,
        data analysis, research, advertising and marketing assistance and/or content for
        the operation and maintenance of the Chi Health Web Sites. We contractually require
        that our operations and maintenance contractors: 1) protect the privacy of your
        Personal and Non-Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy and 2)
        not use or disclose your Personal or Non-Personal Information for any purpose other
        than providing the limited service or function for Chi Health.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Disclosures to Third Party Web Sites</b></p>
    <p>
        Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the Chi Health
        Web Sites are served on, or contain links to, web sites hosted and operated by a
        company other than Chi Health ("Third Party Web Sites"). Chi Health does not disclose
        your Personal Information to these Third Party Web Sites without your consent, but
        you should be aware that any information you disclose to the other web sites once
        you access these other web sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Chi Health
        does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third
        Party Web Sites. You should review the privacy policy posted on the other web site
        to understand how that Third Party Web Site collects and uses your Personal Information.
        Chi Health makes an effort to make it obvious to you when you leave our website
        and enter a Third Party Web Site, either by requiring you to click on a link or
        by notifying you on the site before you visit the third party site. In addition,
        if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with" followed by the
        name of a company other than Chi Health, then you are on a web site hosted by a
        company other than Chi Health.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How Do We Secure and Retain Your Information?</b></p>
    <p>
        We take reasonable security measures to protect the security of your Personal Information.
        Despite Chi Health's efforts to protect your Personal Information, there is always
        some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems
        or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted.</p>
    <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter Personal
        Information (including personal health information in various tools on our website),
        we encrypt the transmission of that information or use SSL connections (Secure Socket
        Layer) technology.</p>
    <p>
        We will retain your Personal Information as long as your account is active or needed
        to provide you services. At any time you can remove your Personal Information or
        instruct us to remove it, but you should be aware that it is not technologically
        possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to
        Chi Health from our servers. Chi Health tools that collect and store Personal Information
        allow you to correct, update or review information you have submitted by going back
        to the specific tool, logging-in and making the desired changes. We will also retain
        your Personal Information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve
        disputes and enforce our agreements.
