<p class="Text"><span><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons </strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the ChiHealth Web Sites and your use of other web sites through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site. Every computer that accesses the ChiHealth Web Sites is assigned a different cookie by ChiHealth. "Web Beacons" are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Third parties under contract with ChiHealth may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the ChiHealth Web Sites, including which health topics you have viewed. These third party advertising service providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help ChiHealth deliver advertising on the ChiHealth Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites. ChiHealth may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent known by ChiHealth or these third parties.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Mobile Device Applications ("Apps")</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>When you download and install one of our ChiHealth Mobile Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App, and please use your mobile device browser to access the ChiHealth Web Sites or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses. Please note that certain ChiHealth Mobile Apps require registration either to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on ChiHealth’s Behalf</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our user community. Sponsors or advertisers on the ChiHealth Web Sites may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the ChiHealth Web Sites and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may be displayed on the ChiHealth Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the ChiHealth Web Sites. Some advertisers use companies other than ChiHealth to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the ChiHealth Web Sites.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the ChiHealth Web Sites.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>What Choices Do I Have? </strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Updating/Removing Your Personal Information</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>If you do not want your Personal Information used by ChiHealth as provided in this Privacy Policy, you should not register as a member or for any specific tool or application that collects Personal Information. You can correct, update or review Personal Information you have previously submitted by going back to the specific tool or application, logging-in and making the desired change. You can also update any Personal Information you have submitted by contacting us using the contact information listed below.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>If you have registered and desire to delete any your Personal Information you have provided to us from our systems please contact us using the contact information listed below. Upon your request, we will delete your Personal Information from our active databases and where feasible from our back-up media. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to the ChiHealth Web Sites from our servers.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>If you decide that you would prefer not to receive personalized email or secure electronic messages from ChiHealth, you may "Opt-out" of the service by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Cookies</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies, some of the functions and conveniences of the ChiHealth Web Sites may not work properly but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use the ChiHealth Web Sites. It is important to note that in order to use the opt-out services described below, you must not reject all Cookies because these opt-out procedures work by placing Cookies on your browser that enable these opt-out procedures to function. The "opt-out Cookies" are placed, for example, in order to help prevent the placement of Cookies used for the targeting of advertising.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of Cookies. In order to do so, you must Opt-out of such data collection with each individual site.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We work with third party ad networks to display advertising on our Sites. Our ad network vendors use technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our web sites to provide you cookie-based targeted advertising based upon your browsing activity and your interests.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>How Information Collected About You Is Used</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Information collected by ChiHealth about you is used by ChiHealth to:</span></p>
<ul class="Text">

<li><span>Conduct research and measurement activities, including those described below.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="Text"><span>ChiHealth may combine Personal and Non-Personal Information collected by ChiHealth about you, and may combine this information with information from external sources.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We also use Cookies in order to enable us to conduct surveys for our own use and on behalf of our advertisers. These Cookies are used to determine whether you have seen certain content or advertising so that we may request your opinions. We may also use Cookies to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have Cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some surveys.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Research and Measurement Activities</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Information that ChiHealth collects about you may be combined by ChiHealth with other information available to ChiHealth through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. This information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic, geographic, personal interests, product purchase activity or other information. We may report aggregate information, which is not able to be identified back to an individual user of the ChiHealth Web Sites, to our current or prospective advertisers and other business partners. We do not sell or share any Personal Information with any third parties, except contractors performing services on our behalf who agree not to use this information received from us for any purpose other than performing services on our behalf.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>With Whom Do We Share Your Information?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, ChiHealth will not disclose any Personal Information it gathers from you through the ChiHealth Web Sites. We may only release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply with legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described below.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, ChiHealth reserves the right to transfer your Personal Information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets. In the event of such a change, your Personal Information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the section below that discusses "Changes to This Privacy Policy."</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Disclosures to ChiHealth Operations and Maintenance Contractor</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>ChiHealth contractors sometimes have limited access to your Personal and Non-Personal Information in the course of providing products or services to ChiHealth. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, data analysis, research, advertising and marketing assistance and/or content for the operation and maintenance of the ChiHealth Web Sites. We contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors: 1) protect the privacy of your Personal and Non-Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy and 2) not use or disclose your Personal or Non-Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for ChiHealth.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Disclosures to Third Party Web Sites</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the ChiHealth Web Sites are served on, or contain links to, web sites hosted and operated by a company other than ChiHealth ("Third Party Web Sites"). ChiHealth does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Web Sites without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose to the other web sites once you access these other web sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. ChiHealth does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Web Sites. You should review the privacy policy posted on the other web site to understand how that Third Party Web Site collects and uses your Personal Information. ChiHealth makes an effort to make it obvious to you when you leave our website and enter a Third Party Web Site, either by requiring you to click on a link or by notifying you on the site before you visit the third party site. In addition, if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with" followed by the name of a company other than ChiHealth, then you are on a web site hosted by a company other than ChiHealth.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>How Do We Secure and Retain Your Information?</strong></span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We take reasonable security measures to protect the security of your Personal Information. Despite ChiHealth's efforts to protect your Personal Information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter Personal Information (including personal health information in various tools on our website), we encrypt the transmission of that information or use SSL connections (Secure Socket Layer) technology.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span>We will retain your Personal Information as long as your account is active or needed to provide you services. At any time you can remove your Personal Information or instruct us to remove it, but you should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to ChiHealth from our servers. ChiHealth tools that collect and store Personal Information allow you to correct, update or review information you have submitted by going back to the specific tool, logging-in and making the desired changes. We will also retain your Personal Information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</span></p>
<p class="Text"><span><strong>Children </strong></span></p>

The ChiHealth Web Sites do not collect Personal Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. A parent or guardian, however, may use ChiHealth to establish a personal health record and a ChiHealth home page for a minor. The parent or guardian is solely responsible for providing supervision of the minor's use of ChiHealth websites. The parent or guardian assumes full responsibility for ensuring that the registration information is kept secure and that the information submitted is accurate. The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through ChiHealth for the minor.</span></p>
