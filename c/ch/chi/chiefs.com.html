<a name="types"></a><b>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</b>
<p>
The following are the types of information we may collect:
</p><p>
<b><i>Information You Provide Us</i></b><br>
Personal information such as your user ID and password, name, email address, telephone number, physical address, birth date, gender or zip code or other information may be collected via the Site.  
</p><p>

<b><i>Site Usage Information</i></b><br>
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit the Site. For example, we may collect click-stream data and your IP address.
</p><p>
<b><i>Email Communications</i></b><br>
When you open emails from the Site, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened an email from us, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from the NFL PARTNERS and our subsidiaries and affiliates.  Additionally, we keep a record of what emails you have opted to and not to receive.
</p><p>
<b><i>Information from Other Sources</i></b><br>
We may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your personal information. 
</p><p>
<a name="info"></a><b>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED </b><br>
We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:
</p><p>
<b><i>Registration</i></b><br>
You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other subscription based services.
</p><p>
<b><i>Newsletters and Site Emails</i></b><br>
We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site.  You may cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances, in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails. 
</p><p>
<b><i>Contests or Sweepstakes</i></b><br>
We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site which may require registration. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes.  We may ask your permission to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winners page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission.    In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information.  In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.
</p><p>
<b><i>Surveys or Voting</i></b><br>
From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls.  Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information.  At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.
</p><p>
<b><i>Cookies</i></b><br>
As with many Web sites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies.  Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences.  By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies.  Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site.  Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you . If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.  
</p><p>
<b><i>IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</i></b><br>
We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address.  When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address. 
</p><p>
Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Site.  Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information.  When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.  
</p><p>
<b><i>Transaction Information</i></b>
</p><p>
If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information.  We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you.  Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection.
</p><p>
<b><i>Fantasy Games</i></b><br>
When you register to play Fantasy games, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information. 
</p><p>
<a name="use"></a><b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</b><br>
Each of the NFL PARTNERS own the information collected via this Site.  As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:
</p><ul>
<li>contact you about the Site;
</li><li>contact you relating to your membership status;
</li><li>confirm or fulfill an order you have made;
</li><li>monitor or improve the use of the Site;
</li><li>customize the advertising and content you see;
</li><li>monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Site;
</li><li>provide special offers to you from the NFL PARTNERS and/or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties;
</li><li>send you promotional material on behalf of our partners;
</li><li>inform you of a prize you have won.
</li></ul>
<a name="share"></a><b>WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</b><br>
At times, we may share your personally identifiable information with others for various purposes.  The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others:
<ul>
<li><b>Agents:</b> We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Site analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
</li><li><b>Promotional Offers:</b> We may send offers to you on behalf of other partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may opt out in the email or change your preferences. 
</li><li><b>Aggregate Information:</b> We may share aggregate information such as demographics and Site usage statistics to advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information. 
</li><li><b>Opt-in and Opt-out Programs:</b> Throughout the Site you may be presented with opportunities to receive special offers from third parties. An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your information to be shared. If you do choose to have your information shared, in an effort to protect you, third parties who have access to personally identifiable information must abide by the current Site privacy policy.  However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other companies, and you should review the privacy practices of such Web sites prior to providing your personally identifiable information.

</li><li><b>Third-Party Ad Serving &amp; Audience and Traffic Measurement Services:</b> The Site may use a third party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Site or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Site.    Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other Web sites you have visited.  Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Web sites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our Site by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Site cookies, the Site's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.   Please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>  in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad servers we may use.  
</li><li><b>NFL Partners Subsidiaries and Affiliates:</b>  We may share your information (including, without limitation, personally identifiable information) with subsidiaries and affiliates of NFL PARTNERS.

</li><li><b>Business Transfers:</b> The Site or an NFL PARTNER may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, your personally identifiable information, which we have gathered, may be one of the business assets we transfer.
</li><li><b>Legal Process:</b> In the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process your personally identifiable information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order or legal process, which may be without notice to you. 
</li></ul>
<p>
<a name="chatrooms"></a><b>CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, AND MESSAGE BOARDS</b><br>
The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users.  You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so.  If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.  The NFL PARTNERS cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board.  Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy.  Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.
</p><p>
<a name="links"></a><b>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</b><br>
You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites  beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.  If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.
