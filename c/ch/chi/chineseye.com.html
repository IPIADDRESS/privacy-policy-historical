  <h2>Privacy Policy<a name="privacy" id="privacy"></a></h2>
   <h4>The Effective Date of this Agreement is on September 10, 2007.</h4>
   <p class="pIndent">
   ChineseYe is an online application that helps people who are interested in China and Chinese find useful information they can trust by soliciting and aggregating experience. 
To accomplish this, our users share their experiences about Chinese things that are posted to the ChineseYe Site. These experiences can then be accessed and read by other ChineseYe users. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "user" is defined as someone using the ChineseYe Site, and a "friend" is defined as someone you have explicitly invited to share reviews with you. To fulfill the purpose of our site, we need to display a limited amount of personal information, so that users are able to evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular review.
By using ChineseYe, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.
	</p>

ChineseYe  also collects user submitted photos, experiences, and ratings of local service  and service providers.
   </p>
   <p class="pIndent">
   Some information collected is not  explicitly submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information,  IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp
   </p>
   <h4>(2) How We Use Your Information</h4>
   <p class="pIndent">
   Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your experiences may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed. If a person is a friend they can also see your name or email address in their list of friends. In addition, we may sell your experiences to third parties, in which case your first name and last initial and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to users of such third party web sites.
   </p>
   <p class="pIndent">
   Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation, or when sharing a experience). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing the "Account" tab of the web site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message). 
   </p>
   <p class="pIndent">
Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer ChineseYe, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.    
   </p>
   <h4>(3) Transfer of Information</h4>
   <p class="pIndent">
We may share your experiences with third parties. Your first name and last initial, profile photo, any submitted photos of businesses, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your experiences may be transferred to such third parties and displayed on their websites in connection with such third parties' publication of your experiences.   
   </p> 
   <p class="pIndent">
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information. ChineseYe will disclose information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further, ChineseYe may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.   
   </p> 
   <p class="pIndent">
We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of ChineseYe, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company.

   <h4>(5) Use of Cookies</h4>
   <p class="pIndent">
Like most websites, ChineseYe requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience.

   </p>
   <h4>(6) Controlling Your Personal Information</h4>
    <p class="pIndent">
You should be aware that when you voluntarily  disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address)  via experiences, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the experience  site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in  your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties  and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.  Such activities are beyond the control of ChineseYe. Please do not post any personal  information on the ChineseYe site or in other areas that you expect to keep  private.     
    </p>
    <p class="pIndent">
As a registered ChineseYe user, you can  modify your personal information at any time by accessing the "My Ye"  section of the site. Also, upon your request, ChineseYe will use commercially  reasonable efforts to functionally remove you and your personal information  from the site; however, it may be impossible to remove your entry without some  residual information being retained by ChineseYe. Registered users who wish to  close their account should contact <a href="mailto:admin@ChineseYe.com">admin@ChineseYe.com</a>.    
    </p>
    <h4>(7) Security</h4>
    <p class="pIndent">
Your ChineseYe account is  password-protected. ChineseYe tries very hard to protect our users'  information. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that  is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information to those  employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer  service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website,  please <a href="mailto:admin@chineseye.com">contact us.</a> Although we take  appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of  information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that  we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this  Privacy Policy.     
    </p>
    <p class="pIndent">
You hereby acknowledge that ChineseYe is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.     
    </p>
    <h4>(8) Terms and Modifications to this Privacy Statement</h4>

<p class="pIndent">While ChinesEye was started in Beijing, ChinesEye knows no boundaries. We have active our communities in many cities around the country and those are growing every day. Since our site is powered by members like you, wherever you are, so is ChinesEye.</p>
<h4>How about Liuzhou, Chongqing, Wuhan?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">Well, not yet. To date, we are focusing on building up ChinesEye in cities listed on our mainpage, but in time we'll extend our coverage. If you're outside those cities, email us at customer@chineseye.com and we'll make sure you're the first to hear.</p>
<h4>What is the "ChinesEye Fans"?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">The ChinesEye Fans is our way of recognizing and rewarding those users who are active ChinesEye evangelists and role models, both on and off the site.</p> 
<p class="pIndent">The conferring is based on a number of things, some of which include well-written and personal reviews of local businesses and services, being accountable for those reviews (use of a real name and photo, etc.), creating useful lists, and voting on reviews and complementing other users.</p> 
<p class="pIndent">If you think you or someone you know might be ready to be ChinesEye Fans, send us an email telling us why to customer@chineseye.com!</p>  

<h3>Profile</h3>
<h4>How do I verify my ChinesEye account?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">When you've completed the registration process, you will receive an email with a special link. Click it to verify your account. When the verification message arrives in your email in-box, click the verification link, or copy and paste it into your browser. Your account will be verified at this point. If it doesn't work drop us an email — customer@chineseye.com.</p>
<h4>How do I change my basic account information?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">To edit your profile or to change your account preferences, log in and click on the "Account Settings" link that appears at the top of any page. You will be able to edit your account preferences here.</p> 
<h4>What is a friend?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">Users can add you as a "Favorite" reviewer (see the "Add to Favorites" links on user profiles) and in doing so they become your friend. You won't be able to see their identity, but they are showing their appreciation for your passionate reviews and they'll also see your reviews first when browsing any businesses you've reviewed.</p>
<h4>What does "Add as Favorite" mean?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">By clicking this link on a user's profile you'll be showing your appreciation for their reviews by becoming their fan. Also you'll see their reviews first whenever you browse a business they've reviewed.</p>
<h4>What are Bookmarks?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">Similar to bookmarks in your web browser, bookmarks on ChinesEye are a way for you to mark a business or review so you can remember to come back to it later. Bookmark buttons are conveniently located at the top of each business listing and at the bottom of business reviews. Clicking on a bookmark button adds that business to your list. You and others may look at your bookmark list by going to your profile and clicking on the "Bookmark" tab at the top of the profile. Users can always see their own bookmarks but may want to keep it private and prevent others from seeing it. "Private" can be clicked at the top of their listing. "Make Public" is the default and will allow anyone to see your bookmark list.</p>
<h3>Invite</h3>
<h4>How do I invite friends?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">ChinesEye is a much better place when your friends are here. So invite all your friends, family and work colleagues, maybe even some enemies just as long as they have some good reviews! (Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.) Click on the "Invite Friends" tab in the header of our home page, and enter the email addresses of the people you'd like to invite to join your network. </p>
<p class="pIndent">We've already created an invitation message for you, but feel free to personalize it. The invitation will automatically contain your user name as entered in your ChinesEye account settings, and will contain your email address in the "From:" line. When you finished customizing your message, just click “Send”.</p>
<p class="pIndent">The invitation will include a link that brings your friend to ChinesEye, where they'll be able to read more about why ChinesEye is the fun and easy way to make, recommend and talk about what's great in their world. If they accept your invitation, they'll automatically appear in your network. </p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<h4>What does ChinesEye do with my personal information?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">We take privacy very seriously. We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information, unless required to by law. We hate Spam even more than you do. </p>
<h3>Writing Reviews</h3>
<h4>What makes for a great review?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">ChinesEye reviews are useful, funny and cool because people like you take the time to share thoughtful insights on local businesses and services.</p>
<p class="pIndent">The best reviews are personal and experiential, and tend to offer helpful suggestions, perhaps even an insider tip or two. The most useful reviews sometimes make mention of unique qualities that make the business special, or the type of person who might also like this business.</p>
<h4>What should I review?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">Any business, service or place to go with a physical address is fair game for being reviewed on ChinesEye. Say: restaurants, shops, bars, salons, spas, dentists, mechanics, pediatricians, golf courses, parks, museums etc.</p>
<h4>What if I had a bad experience? Can I say something negative?</h4>
<p class="pIndent">Yes, absolutely. We want to hear about your good experiences and your bad ones. Be sure to include all the relevant facts and details.</p>

<p class="pIndent">But whether it's a positive review or a negative one, please keep in mind that your opinions are generally protected but posting false information can have legal ramifications.</p>
