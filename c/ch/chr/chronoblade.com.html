		<p class="important">
			This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive
			when you visit our Site and use our Service. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or
			applications, including any websites, services and applications that you may access through our Service. Unless we
			define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our
			Terms of Service.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>How do we collect and use information?</h5>
		<p>
			Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Service, to administer your use of the
			Service (and, if you have registered an account with us, administer your account), and to enable you to enjoy and
			easily navigate our Service.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Account Information</h5>
		<p>
			When you create an account we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you,
			such as your name and email address (“PII”). We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot
			be used by itself to identify you, such as your gender, birth date or age, and zip code. If you choose to create an
			account using a Social Networking Service, you will provide us with your username (or userID) so that your identity can
			be authenticated by the Social Networking Service account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to link
			your account with the Social Networking Service account and access certain PII, such as your name and email address,
			and other information that your privacy settings on the Social Networking Service account permit us to access.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information Collected Using Cookies
		</h5>
		<p>
			We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text
			files that are saved by your browser when you access our Service. We may use both session cookies and persistent
			cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Service and to tell us how and when you interact with our Service.
			We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Service and to customize and
			improve our Service. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Service and
			close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to
			stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you
			don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions of the Service. Some third-party services providers
			that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this
			Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information Related to Use of the Service
		</h5>
		<p>
			Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person
			uses our Service (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders
			(either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type,
			operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Service, the pages or features of our
			Service to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Service
			that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Service and we analyze (and may
			engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Service by expanding their features and
			functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We generally use IP addresses to fight spam,
			malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how
			our Service is used.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Location Information
		</h5>
		<p>
			In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by
			converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our
			Service for you.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?
		</h5>
		<p>
			We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information Shared with Our Service Providers
		</h5>
		<p>
			We may engage third party service providers to work with us to
			administer and provide the Service. These third-party services providers have access to your information only to the
			extent necessary and for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information Shared with Third Parties
		</h5>
		<p>
			We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with
			third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions
		</h5>
		<p>
			Information that we collect from our users is
			considered to be a business asset and if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or
			asset sale, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be transferred to a third-party as a
			business asset in connection with such a transaction.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others
		</h5>
		<p>
			We may disclose information about you
			to government or law enforcement officials or to private parties as we, in our reasonable discretion, believe it is
			necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests,
			including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property
			and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or
			unethical.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request
		</h5>
		<p>
			We will share your PII with third-party sites or
			platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			The Security of Your Information
		</h5>
		<p>
			We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you from unauthorized access,
			use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing
			information is completely secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Links to Other Sites
		</h5>
		<p>
			Our Service may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party
			website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy
			policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content,
			privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend
			that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Modifying Your Information
		</h5>
		<p>
			You can access and modify your personal information through your account. If you want us to delete any of your
			personal information and/or your account, please <a href="mailto:contact@nway.com?subject=Privacy Policy">contact us</a> with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your
			information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or
			as otherwise required by law.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			International Users
		</h5>
		<p>
			Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province,
			country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your
			jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer your
			information to the United States and process it there (or any other country in which we operate).
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Our Policy Toward Children
		</h5>
		<p>
			Our Service is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn
			that we have collected PII of someone under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as
			possible.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Changes to Privacy Policy
		</h5>
		<p>
			Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
			We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this
			Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Service or by sending you an email or other 
			notification, and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>
			Questions?
		</h5>

			Please contact us at contact@nway.com if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.
