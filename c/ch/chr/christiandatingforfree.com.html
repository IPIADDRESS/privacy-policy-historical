                  <br>
                  BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU  REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS  OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT  UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST  IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.<br>

              <strong>1. &nbsp; CHILDREN’S  PRIVACY</strong>
              <br>
              CDFF does not solicit or  knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the  age of 14.&nbsp; If CDFF obtains actual  knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a  child under the age of 14, CDFF will immediately delete such information from  its database.&nbsp; Because CDFF does not  collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 14, CDFF  has no such information to use or disclose to third parties.&nbsp; CDFF has designed this Privacy Policy in  order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Act (COPPA). <br><br>
                <strong>2. &nbsp; INFORMATION  COLLECTION PRACTICES<br>
                <br>
</strong> <strong>(a) Traffic Data.&nbsp; </strong>Like most website operators, CDFF automatically  gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available,  including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers  accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website  (collectively “<strong>Traffic Data</strong>”).&nbsp; Traffic Data is anonymous information that  does not personally identify You.&nbsp;<br>
<br> 
<strong>(b) Cookies.&nbsp; </strong>A “<strong>Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that  a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to  the website each time the user submits a query to the website.&nbsp; The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the  user as a unique user of the Website.&nbsp; CDFF  uses Cookies to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to  ensure that You do not see the same advertisements or informational messages  repeatedly, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each  time You visit the Website.&nbsp; For  additional information on CDFF’ uses of Cookies, see the section concerning  Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered  Using Cookies, below.
              <br>
              IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE  COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES  BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE  SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT  THE AID OF COOKIES.&nbsp; IF YOU REFUSE  COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. <br><br>
              <strong>(c) Personal Information.&nbsp; </strong>In order for You to use certain of the  Services, You may be asked to provide CDFF certain information that personally  identifies You (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”).  Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) “<strong>Contact Data</strong>” (such as Your name and e-mail address); and (2) “<strong>Demographic Data</strong>” (such as Your age, gender,  ethnicity, height, weight, hair color, likes and dislikes, profession,  education level, marital status, religious affiliation, parental status,  smoking and drinking habits, country, state, city and zip code).<strong> </strong>In each  case, You will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not  gather it surreptitiously.&nbsp; CDFF may  supplement the Personal Information You provide with additional Personal  Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer  reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to CDFF.&nbsp;
  <br>
  You are under no obligation  to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to do so may  prevent You from using certain of the Services.<br><br>
              <strong>(d) Information You Make Public.&nbsp; </strong>The Website contains features (<em>e.g.</em> public profiles, chat rooms,  forums, and message boards) that permit You to upload, post, transmit, display,  perform or distribute content, information or other, including Your Personal  Information.&nbsp; Any information that You  choose to disclose by means of such features becomes public information over  which CDFF is unable to exercise control.&nbsp;  You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Your Personal  Information by means of such features, and You agree to assume all  responsibility for doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br>
              <br>
