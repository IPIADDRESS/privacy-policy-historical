<p><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When you place an order or make a purchase from ChristianAudigier.com, we use your personal information to process your order, send you e-mails to confirm your order or to contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order or purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To serve you better, we may combine information you give us and information about your product interest and purchases with information from third parties, including demographic information and information that is publicly available.</span></p>

</span></p><div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Unfortunately, some credit card transactions are declined. This is most often due to discrepancies in the information entered on the order. Internet-based transaction systems are very sensitive to the accuracy of the information entered for the transaction. Should your order be declined, be sure to verify the following:</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">1. The billing address and shipping address match the billing address on your credit card. Corporate credit card holders may need to inquire about where the credit card statements are billed to;</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">2. Be sure that the Security Code (CVV code) on the back of your card has been entered, and that it has been entered correctly;</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">3. For international orders, spell out your address explicitly and without abbreviations;</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">4. Be sure that you are not missing any information on the form, such as last name or zip code;</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">5. Be sure that the zip code you entered is correct;</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">6. Be sure that you have enough available credit on your account</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">If your transaction is still declined, please email us for assistance, at <a href="mailto:customerservice@christianaudigier.com">customerservice@christianaudigier.com</a> . DO NOT EMAIL YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER TO US.</span></div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="COLOR: #000000">
<p align="center"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: #000000"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Credit Holds and Releases</span></span> 
</span></p><div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When our transaction system requests approval for your order, an electronic request is submitted to the bank that issued your credit card. Often, a bank will issue an approval code for the transaction to our system even though the zip code and/or address or card code you entered is incorrect. When our verification system receives the approval and the status of your address, zip code or card code match, it may decline the order due to a code, address or zip code mismatch. The reason is that the order must pass our Fraud Protection Filters to protect you from unauthorized transactions. The result may be that your bank still is holding funds against your credit limit though your order has been declined by our system. We do not have control over the period of time in which your bank keeps the hold and when they release the hold on your account. This varies greatly between financial institutions. We cannot request that a financial institution release a hold due to the way in which member banks operate. If your transaction has been declined and your bank indicates it is issuing a hold, we recommend waiting two business days before contacting your bank about the status of the hold. By this time, most all holds are released.</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Our transaction policies and procedures have been designed to provide you with the best protection against unauthorized transactions on your account. While at times they may inconvenience the cardholder, we would rather protect your safety than risk shipping an unauthorized order against your account without your approval.</span></div>
<div><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></div>
<div>
<p><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We appreciate your patronage and understanding.</span></p>
