<br><h2>information gathered by luminary publishing, Inc.</h2>When you visit the Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s websites (www.Chronogram.com and www.HVHealthyLiving.com; henceforth referred to as "Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s websites") and interact with the services and tools that reside there, Luminary Publishing, Inc. and the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services to Luminary Publishing, Inc. may collect information on your actions. This type of information is generally collected from two sources; from the server log files and from cookies. How we collect and disseminate information<br><br>The information collected by Luminary Publishing, Inc. is used to create aggregated portraits of our audience, representing anonymous statistical demographic information but never personally identifiable information. This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand whom the Luminary Publishing, Inc. audience is. For example, we may create a report indicating that 40 percent of our readers are married women with one or more children living in their household, so that potential advertisers and partners can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our readers.<br><br>In order to better understand how we collect and disseminate information, please keep reading this document.<br>
<br><h2>electronic newsletters</h2>Luminary Publishing, Inc. offers free electronic newsletters on a variety of topics. If you choose to subscribe to any of our newsletters, currently the only information you will be required to provide is a valid email address. In order to receive these newsletters you must opt-in to receiving them. Generally, Luminary Publishing, Inc. does not share mailing lists from its electronic newsletters with third parties. However, in some situations, Luminary Publishing, Inc. may share its newsletter mailing lists with third parties who provide newsletter fulfillment services on our behalf. In these instances, such third parties will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
<br><h2>surveys and polls</h2>Our surveys typically ask for demographic information (like zip code, age, gender, and other personal information). We may also seek your opinions on various issues and very often these surveys and polls are sponsored by or associated with Luminary Publishing, Inc. advertisers and partners. Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally or shared with advertisers and partners only in the aggregated form. In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any Luminary Publishing, Inc. reader, such personally identifiable information is never provided to third parties without your consent. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only. 
<br><h2>contests</h2>Luminary Publishing, Inc occasionally has contests and giveaways for our readers. We typically ask you for your first and last names, email address and daytime phone number (to notify you if you've won). In some situations, we may need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection. This information is shared with a third party: When you choose to receive information from a third party contest sponsor; or when a contest is hosted by Luminary Publishing, Inc. but administered by a sponsor; we will advise you of this in the contest rules.<br><br>You should carefully review the rules of each contest and giveaway which you enter as they may contain additional important information about Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s or a sponsor's use of your personal information.

We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or the content of non-Luminary Publishing, Inc. websites, and we do not control the practices of any of our advertisers or partners whose links appear on our websites.<br><br>In any instance where personally identifiable information is required to be provided to or shared with Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s advertisers and partners, we will advise you when such advertiser or partner will receive your personal information, and further advise you as to which Privacy Policy will control the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information you provide. Luminary Publishing, Inc. will use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all third party advertisers and partners to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners or sponsors will use information about you, please contact them directly.
