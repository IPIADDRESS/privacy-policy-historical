henceforth referred to as "Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s websites") and interact with the services and tools that reside there, Luminary Publishing, Inc. and the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services to Luminary Publishing, Inc. may collect information on your actions.

This aggregated information is used, among other things, to determine trends and needs, and also to supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand whom the Luminary Publishing, Inc. audience is. For example, we may create a report indicating that 40 percent of our readers are married women with one or more children living in their household, so that potential advertisers and partners can determine which of their products or services are most appropriate for our readers.</p><p>In order to better understand how we collect and disseminate information, please keep reading this document.</p><div class="subhead">Electronic newsletters</div><p>Luminary Publishing, Inc. offers free electronic newsletters on a variety of topics.

Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally or shared with advertisers and partners only in the aggregated form. In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any Luminary Publishing, Inc. reader, such personally identifiable information is never provided to third parties without your consent. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only</p><div class="subhead">Contests</div><p>Luminary Publishing, Inc occasionally has contests and giveaways for our readers. We typically ask you for your first and last names, email address and daytime phone number (to notify you if you've won).

This information is shared with a third party:</p><p> - When you choose to receive information from a third party contest sponsor; or<br>- When a contest is hosted by Luminary Publishing, Inc. but administered by a sponsor; we will advise you of this in the contest rules.</p><p>You should carefully review the rules of each contest and giveaway which you enter as they may contain additional important information about Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s or a sponsor's use of your personal information.</p><div class="subhead">Links to advertiser, partner, and third-party sites</div><p>Luminary Publishing, Inc.'s websites contain links to advertiser, partner, and third-party websites.

Luminary Publishing, Inc. will use commercially reasonable efforts to contractually require all third party advertisers and partners to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners or sponsors will use information about you, please contact them directly.</p><div class="subhead">Information we collect by through IP address and cookies</div><p></p><div class="subhead2">IP Address</div><p>Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to your computer to identify its location.
