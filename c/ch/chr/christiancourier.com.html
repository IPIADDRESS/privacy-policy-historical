You also enable us to personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service.

We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.</p>
<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your email address on this web site and/or registering to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (<span class="caps">ATSR</span>), 16 <span class="caps">CFR</span> ‘310 et seq. and any applicable state and local “do not call” regulations.
