<h3 align="left">
WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p align="left">
There are many places at our sites where you can share your personal information
with us, and where you can communicate with others.<br>
<br>
<strong>Registration.</strong> Some of our sites give you the opportunity to register with
us, and sometimes registration is required before certain site features can be
used. Our registration forms may request your contact information (such as your
name, email address, mailing address, etc.), demographic information (such as
your country, gender, etc.), and profile data (such as your music preferences,
entertainment practices, etc). You may be assigned a site username and/or
password. For our internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with
you and provide the services you have requested, and to provide a more
personalized experience on our sites. For example, your registration may allow
you to use and post to site message boards, create site profiles, etc. We use
aggregate demographic and profile information about our audience in order to
improve our service, for research purposes, marketing/promotional purposes
and/or for industry reporting purposes, among others. By visiting our sites, you
affirmatively consent to our collection and use of your data.</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Newsletters and Other Communications from Us.</strong> Our registered users and
customers may receive newsletters, email communications, or communications
through other channels for, among other purposes, the promotion and marketing of
a product or service from our family of sites and record labels, as well as
other Vivendi Universal companies, and business partners, and we may also offer
other visitors to our sites the opportunity to sign up to receive such
information. When there is a separate sign-up for newsletters, we ask for
contact information such as name and email address, and, sometimes, demographic
and profile information. By visiting our sites, you affirmatively consent to our
collection and use of your data. We use this information in the same manner as
we use the contact information in the Registration process described above. We
may offer our users the choice whether to receive mailings from others that we
think will be of interest. Recipients of our mailings can unsubscribe by
following instructions that may appear at the end of email communications. Note
that in order to keep our registered users informed about the operation of our
services, we may send emails and announcements that are needed for the proper
functioning and administration of our sites and service.<br>
<br>
<strong>Communications with Us. </strong>We have features where you can submit information
to us (such as when contacting us with a question or feedback). We may retain
your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal purposes,
and to help us to serve you better.</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Communications with Friends.</strong> We may offer features where you can send
information to others, such as e-cards or "Tell A Friend" features. We will use
the contact information you enter for your friends to send the email or e-card.<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactive and Community Features. </strong>Our sites may offer interactive and
community features, such as message boards, chat, email accounts, short message
service (SMS), instant messaging, profiles, personal homepages, etc. All information posted or sent
through these features may be publicly available, and you should be aware that
when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, email
address, phone number) through these features, that information can be collected
and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications from other
people. By accessing these features and disclosing personal information, you
affirmatively consent to the distribution of your personal information as
described above. Users' posts may be publicly and/or internally associated with
their profiles/screen-names. Users are solely responsible for the content of
messages they post or send on public forums.<br>
<br>
<strong>Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys.</strong> We may also have contests, sweepstakes
and surveys at our sites. When you enter or participate in them, we request
contact information from you (such as your full name, email address, mailing
address, and telephone number) and may also request demographic or profile
information. We will use the information you provide for the purpose of
conducting the promotion (for example, to contact you if you have won). We may
also use the information to send you newsletters and other information we think
may be of interest. Recipients of our mailings can unsubscribe by following
instructions that may appear at the end of the email communication. Any personal
information we collect may be associated with registration information. We may
share aggregate information with others. We may sometimes partner with sponsors
in offering contests, sweepstakes or surveys, and may share (provide and
receive) information with them. By entering or participating in such contests,
sweepstakes, and surveys, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of
your data.</p>

<h3 align="left">
AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION</h3>

<p align="left">
Our web sites have features that automatically collect information from users to
assist us in creating sites that honor our users' preferences and serve their
interests and needs.</p>

<p align="left">
Some of our sites use cookies, which are small data files containing information
about the user that are stored on the user's hard drive. Some cookies are used
to make login to our sites easier (such as by remembering usernames and
passwords). If users reject cookies, they may be limited in using some areas of
our sites. Cookies can also enable us to track users' movements and target their
interests to enhance their experience at our sites. We may also collect
clickstream data and assign unique identifiers to our users for the same
purposes. Information obtained with these technologies may be associated with
your personal information. </p>

<p align="left">
We or a third-party advertisement server may also use cookies in connection with
targeting advertisements or promotions to users. Our advertisers and other third
parties whose products or services are promoted on our sites may also use
cookies or other technology, and we advise you to check their privacy policies
for information about their privacy practices. </p>

<p align="left">
We may also gather information such as the date, time, browser type, navigation
history, and IP address of all visitors to our site(s). We use this information
for our internal security audit log, trend analysis, and system administration,
and to gather broad demographic information about our user base. We may
associate this information with your personal information.  By visiting our sites,
you affirmatively consent to our collection, use, and distribution of your data.</p>

<h3 align="left">
WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</h3>

<p>Information provided at Artist sites that we host or manage may be shared
with that Artist, including their management, representatives, and any new label
they may join. As with other third parties, we are not responsible for how the
Artists handle the data once they receive it. When we have co-branded or
sponsored services, when we host a site, or when we join with other parties to
provide specific services, we may share (provide and receive) your personal
information with them. By visiting these sites, you affirmatively consent to our
collection, use and distribution of your data. <br>
We may share your information with other third parties with whom we have
business relationships and, in some cases, we cannot control or know their
privacy practices. By visiting our sites, you affirmatively consent to our
collection, use, and distribution of your data.</p>
<p>Other than as set forth in this policy, we do not share your personally
identifiable information with other companies, apart from those acting as our
agents in providing our service to you, and which agree to use it only for that
purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, please be
aware that our parent company, Vivendi Universal, including all its business
units, subsidiaries, affiliates and sites, Universal Music Group's subsidiary
and affiliated companies and sites, entities into which our companies may be
merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations
may be transferred, may obtain from us and be able to use your personal
information. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do
so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other
legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in
special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)
our rights or property. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as
U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to
permit your information to be shared or transferred to third parties without
your permission. </p>
<p>We may share (provide and receive) aggregate information, which is not
personally identifiable, with others. This information may include demographic
data such as the gender and/or geographic location of groups of users, but it
will not include personal information (such as your name or email address). We
use aggregate demographic information about our audience in order to improve our
service, for research purposes, marketing/promotional purposes and/or for
industry reporting purposes, among others.</p>

<h3 align="left">
CHOICE</h3>

<p align="left">
By accepting this privacy policy, you expressly choose to receive certain
communications from us and third parties, and you expressly agree to the privacy
practices described herein. Our sites may also provide you with additional
specific opportunities to select communications you wish to receive. You may
change your privacy preferences, e.g. choose to cease receiving certain
communications, by informing us of your new preferences. We will be able to
honor your new preferences most quickly if you inform us of them by following
the appropriate instructions in any communication you receive from us.
Please be aware that messages you receive from us through SMS and instant
messaging systems (and other systems apart from email) may not include an option
to cease receiving communications; to change your privacy preferences with
respect to those communications, please go to the profile page at the site where
you provided your personal information or direct your instructions to the
Contact identified at the end of this policy.</p>

<h3 align="left">
ACCESS</h3>

<p align="left">
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), we
endeavor to provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data. Please
feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding making changes to
your data.</p>

<h3 align="left">
DATA COLLECTION FROM CHILDREN</h3>

<p align="left">
We strive to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
We do not knowingly collect personal information from U.S. children under 13
without appropriate parental notice and consent. Sites that are directed to
children where personal information is collected should have a Children's
Privacy Policy setting forth our COPPA-compliant practices. At many sites, we
actively screen-out children from data collection and/or use of interactive or
community features. We are committed to protecting children's privacy.</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>NOTICE: Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy">www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy</a> for information from the Federal Trade
Commission about protecting children's privacy online.</strong></p>

<h3 align="left">

SECURITY</h3>

<p align="left">
Security for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to
us. We store your personal information securely, and use special procedures
designed to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized
access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. </p>

<h3 align="left">
MERCHANT/E-COMMERCE AREAS</h3>

<p align="left">
We do not generally make e-commerce offerings at our sites. Some of our sites do
have merchant/e-commerce areas, where users can purchase merchandise. Universal
Music Group does not run those areas of our sites. Personal information
collected at those areas is not shared with Universal Music Group without the
purchasers' consent. At each of those areas, we endeavor to provide a privacy
policy link where users can review the privacy policies that apply to data
collection and use at those areas, and we urge our users to review them. Please
be aware that the site at iClassics.com is an exception, where we do make
e-commerce offerings, and it is covered by a separate privacy policy. Please
review it if you use that site.</p>

<h3 align="left">
LINKS</h3>

<p align="left">
We may provide links to non-Universal Music Group sites. We are not responsible
for those other sites, their privacy policies or how they treat information
about their users, and we advise you to check their privacy policies.</p>

<h3 align="left">
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h3>

<p align="left">
We reserve the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at
any time, so we encourage you to review this policy from time to time. Changes
to this privacy policy are effective at the time they are posted and your
continued use of our sites after posting will constitute acceptance of, and
agreement to be bound by, those changes. </p>
