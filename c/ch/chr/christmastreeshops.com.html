	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
</header>
<article>
	
	<section>
	<h3>Policy Effective Date: This policy became effective on April 18, 2006.</h3>
	<p>At Christmas Tree Shops we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, which is why we do not sell or rent any personal identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. We hope the policy below will answer all of your questions regarding how we treat information gathered from visitors to christmastreeshops.com. Feel free to e-mail us at webmaster@christmastreeshops.com with any questions you might have.</p>
	<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>In order to process your order efficiently, we collect the following information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card number ("Personal Information") when you place an order with us. We also may periodically conduct surveys of visitors to our Web site. This helps us better understand what our customers would like to see from us. We use this information for internal marketing research purposes. We may contact a visitor who responded to a survey for more information, but only if that visitor has told us that they don't mind being contacted.</p>
	<p>With respect to emails that you may receive from us, we capture data related to the opening and click-through from these emails. This information is used for internal Christmas Tree Shops review and analysis only.</p>
	<h2>Use of Information that You Provide</h2>
	<p>At Christmas Tree Shops we collect Personal Information only for the purposes of fulfilling orders, providing a high level of customer service, and gaining knowledge internally regarding our customers’ needs. We do not give or sell Personal Information to any other party, except to our employees and agents whom we rely on to handle this information on our behalf in accordance with the above purposes.</p>
	<h2>Release of Information to Protect Website and Others</h2>
	<p>Christmas Tree Shops may release Personal Information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is necessary to comply with law, protect the rights, properties or safety of Christmas Tree Shops, our users or others, or enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements.</p>
	<h2>How to Opt-out</h2>
	<p>We ask that you tell us when you do not wish to receive periodic e-mails from us. We will only send e-mail for customer service purposes and to those visitors who have indicated that they wish to receive other types of e-mail from us. If at any time you wish to stop receiving e-mail from us, you can always remove your name from our mailing list by sending an e-mail to webmaster@christmastreeshops.com stating that you wish to unsubscribe and indicating in the subject line of the e-mail "NO E-MAIL".	</p>
	<h2>Security of the Information You Provide	</h2>
	<p>Among our top priorities is keeping your Personal Information secure. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt all of your Personal Information before it is transmitted to us. Encrypted information cannot be read or recorded as it travels over the Internet. You can tell you are sending information securely by the unbroken key icon or closed lock icon that should appear at the bottom of your internet browser's window (depending on what browser you use). These icons will appear when you are placing an order on our Web site. In addition, you will see our site address change slightly, from http: to https: indicating a secure server connection is being used. The computers that store your Personal Information are located in a separate facility, which employs the latest in firewall and security technology.</p>
	<p>If you prefer not to disclose your credit card information online, you can always place your gift card order by calling or visiting one of our many stores. Click here to locate the store nearest you and to receive driving directions.</p>
	<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
	<p>We use cookies to provide our customers with streamlined ordering and other useful features. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information while you're at our site. The use of cookies has become an industry standard used by most major Web sites. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent acceptance. Please continue to review our privacy policy from time to time so that you are aware of our current policy with respect to cookies.</p>
	<h2>Intended Users—Use By Children</h2>
	<p>Our gift cards and any other products we may have available for sale on the Christmas Tree Shops website are intended to be purchased by adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Christmas Tree Shops will promptly delete information provided by a child. Simply contact us at webmaster@christmastreeshops.com .</p>
