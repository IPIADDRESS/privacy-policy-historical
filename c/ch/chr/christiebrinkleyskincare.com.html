<br><br><p class="header">Account Information.</p>You can browse our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, debit or credit card information or physical contact information about yourself. If you create an account or purchase any of our products or Services, you choose to give us your personal information and are not anonymous to us.

If you permit a connection between a Social Network and our Services we (and that Social Network) may be able to identify you and to associate information received from the connection with information we already have about you. Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information of any Social Network connected to our Services.

<br><br><p class="header">Surveys And Promotions.</p> From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions.  Participation in these surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions is completely voluntary.

<br><br><p class="header">Information You Post.</p>Any information or content you post when participating with the Services, Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by CB and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public.

If you enable location services for our Services we may collect location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. We may also use this data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the platform you use to access our Services (e.g., Apple, iOS, Google, Android, Windows, etc.) you may be able to control from within the settings on your wireless device or the Service(s) whether location data is collected.

<p class="header">Permission To Contact You.</p> When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or Service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about our Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving, in accordance with law.

<br><br><p class="header">Links To Other Sites.</p> To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third party sites or applications, you should be aware that these external or third party sites are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third party sites or applications to determine how your personal information will be utilized by the proprietors.

<br><br><p class="header">Security.</p> We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control, including to protect your data. SSL is encryption technology that helps safeguard your personally identifiable information against misuse by unauthorized individuals. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personal information, and your use of the Services indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.

<br><br><p class="header">Jurisdiction And Cross-Border Issues.</p> We do not represent or warrant that any of our Services is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Services do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit access to our Services, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion. By using our Services and submitting any personal information, you consent to the transfer of personal information to other countries, such as the United States, which may provide a level of data security different from your country of residence. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning the Services.

<br><br><p class="header">Children’s Privacy.</p> The Services are directed to a general audience and we restrict the use of our Services to individuals age 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13 years of age and if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s personal information from our systems. If you become aware that anyone under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us in accordance with the "Contacting Us" in Section 7 below

<br><br><p class="header">No Rights Of Third Parties.</p> This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Services.

<a name="sect6a" id="sect6a"></a>
<br><br><p class="header">Changes To The Privacy Policy.</p> We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the Services. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Services, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy. You should check the Services frequently for updates. By accessing the Services after the Effective Date you are deemed to consent to our then-current Privacy Policy.

<br><br><p class="header">Your California Privacy Rights.</p> California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please <a href="#sect7">contact us</a>. For all requests, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

<p><strong>EXAMPLES OF TRACKING TOOLS</strong></p>
		<p>
			<strong>Cookies</strong>. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Services.&nbsp; We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Services.&nbsp; Cookies are stored on users' hard drives.&nbsp; We use both "session ID cookies"; and "persistent cookies.";&nbsp; Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser.&nbsp; Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information.&nbsp; Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next.&nbsp; Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.&nbsp; Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.&nbsp; Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.&nbsp; You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.&nbsp; However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please clickwww.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.&nbsp; If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Web Beacons/GIFS</strong>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1×1 GIFs"; or "clear GIFs";) may be included in our web pages and messages.&nbsp; Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.&nbsp; Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Embedded Scripts</strong>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.&nbsp; The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device used to access Services from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>HTML5</strong>. We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iPhone or iPad.&nbsp; HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.&nbsp; Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser "cookies"; file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.&nbsp; To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>e-tags/cache browers/web logs</strong>. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Services.&nbsp; We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types.&nbsp; This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits.&nbsp; We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.&nbsp; We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
