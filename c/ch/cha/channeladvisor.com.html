              <strong>Privacy Policy </strong> </h1>
              <p>ChannelAdvisor Corporation ("<strong>ChannelAdvisor</strong>") provides technology and   services that enable industry-leading companies ("<strong>ChannelAdvisor   Client(s)</strong>") to use online marketplaces to acquire customers   ("<strong>Buyers</strong>") and maximize inventory yield. ChannelAdvisor is committed to   maintaining the privacy of its users, including both ChannelAdvisor Clients and   Buyers. If you have accessed this Privacy Policy by clicking on the privacy   policy link on a site other than the ChannelAdvisor web site, your information   may be collected by ChannelAdvisor as a service to the entity that controls such   other web site and the ChannelAdvisor privacy policy terms will apply to the   collection of your personal information.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy describes the ChannelAdvisor practices for gathering,   storing, using and disseminating information. <strong>By visiting this website you   agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do   not agree with the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use or   access the ChannelAdvisor services. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you   expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable   information as outlined below.</strong> This policy may be changed from time to time.   All changes will be posted to this site and you are encouraged to periodically   check back to this site for any changes to the privacy policy.</p>
              <p><strong>A. INFORMATION COLLECTION<br>
                <br>
              </strong>If you are using the online marketplace services of ChannelAdvisor (the   "Services"), whether through the ChannelAdvisor website or a ChannelAdvisor   Client site powered by ChannelAdvisor, ChannelAdvisor may collect personal   information about you including billing and shipping addresses, credit card   purchasing information, product information and product order information. In   addition, ChannelAdvisor may also collect information about your bidding, buying   and selling history as well as third party comments regarding your bidding,   buying and selling behavior. Bidding and buying history may specifically include   your history with respect to any failure to complete sales on winning bids.   ChannelAdvisor will collect any comments you may send to ChannelAdvisor and any   information you may post to the ChannelAdvisor site or a ChannelAdvisor Client   site powered by ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor may also collect information   through the use of Cookies (as defined below).<br>
                ChannelAdvisor collects   personal information when you: (1) register with ChannelAdvisor, (2) become a   ChannelAdvisor Client, (3) participate in an auction for a product listed by a   ChannelAdvisor Client, (4) complete a checkout page for a product purchased from   a ChannelAdvisor Client, (5) provide comments or submit a problem to   ChannelAdvisor or a ChannelAdvisor Client, (6) request information from   ChannelAdvisor and provide your name or return contact information, or (7)   respond to special offers, contests or surveys. As part of the registration or   checkout process, you may be asked to provide contact and billing information   and other personally identifying information. Providing some of the requested   information is optional and ChannelAdvisor will indicate what information is   required and what information is optional.</p>
              <p><strong>B. COOKIES</strong><br>
                <br>                "Cookies" are data files that may be downloaded to your computer when you   visit the ChannelAdvisor site or a ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by   ChannelAdvisor and permit the ChannelAdvisor server to identify your browser   whenever you interact with the ChannelAdvisor site or a ChannelAdvisor Client   site powered by ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor uses cookies to recognize repeat   visits by users of its site and to collect information about its users'   interactions with the Services. These cookies contain identification information   that enables us to streamline your experiences using the Services. You may set   your browser software to reject cookies, but you will be required to reenter   your login information each time you access the Services, and you may not be   able to optimize the features of the Services. In some cases, you will not be   able to access Services if cookies are disabled. </p>
              <p><strong>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION<br>
                <br>
              </strong>1) <strong>Bidding and Buying Process. If you are a Buyer</strong> and you are involved   in a transaction with a ChannelAdvisor Client (for example, a seller of an item   you are purchasing), we share personally identifiable information about you with   that ChannelAdvisor Client in order to assist you with the bidding and buying   process as well as to assist ChannelAdvisor Clients with the selling process.   ChannelAdvisor will retain your information at ChannelAdvisor to support the   transaction. To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Clients have access to your   personally identifiable information, these entities will treat this information   in no less a secure manner than they treat the personally identifiable   information of customers who purchase directly through the web site of that   ChannelAdvisor Client. If you are a Buyer, you are encouraged to review the   privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Clients that provide the products or   services related to your bid or purchase. You should contact ChannelAdvisor   Clients directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions   concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications   you may or may not wish to receive.</p>
              <p>2) <strong>Customer Support.</strong> Contact information provided by you in connection   with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems,   comments or requests and may be provided to ChannelAdvisor Clients or third   parties as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. </p>
              <p> 3) <strong>Marketing/Special offers/Solicitation from ChannelAdvisor. </strong>ChannelAdvisor may use registration information to provide updates, and   other business purposes related to making available the features and functions   of Services. ChannelAdvisor also may use registration information and checkout   information to make you aware of new products or special offers or promotions.   ChannelAdvisor will abide by requests from you (in accordance with the Section D   below) to discontinue such use. <strong>If you are a Buyer:</strong> (i) you will receive   such information as described in this Section C (3) only if you have opted to   receive such information from ChannelAdvisor as part of your checkout process;   (ii) you may opt out of receiving such information (if you have already opted in   to receive it) by sending a request in accordance with Section D below. As a   Buyer, if you receive communications directly from a ChannelAdvisor Client, you   should contact the ChannelAdvisor Client directly concerning such communications   and review their privacy policies.</p>
              <p>4) <strong>Providing Your Information to Third Parties for Marketing/Solicitation. </strong></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>(i)<strong> If you are a ChannelAdvisor Client (not a "Buyer"), </strong>ChannelAdvisor   may provide certain of your registration information to third parties for use in   marketing and in designing or providing their own services, to send you   information about its products and to notify you if you win a contest. You may   opt-out of ChannelAdvisor providing such information to third parties at any   time by updating your Personal Account Settings or by contacting ChannelAdvisor,   as set forth in Sections D and H below, respectively. You should contact the   third party directly who may already be sending you messages in order to request   these communications stop, and to review their privacy policies.</p>
                <p>(ii) <strong>If you are a Buyer,</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> ChannelAdvisor does not sell your   information to third parties for purposes of marketing or soliciting you; and <strong>(2)</strong> To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Clients (for example, a seller of   an item you purchased) have access to your personally identifiable information   as a result of your bidding or buying (reference C (1) above, where   ChannelAdvisor provides your information to ChannelAdvisor Clients as part of a   transaction you may be involved in with such ChannelAdvisor Client), these   entities may solicit or market to you in accordance with their policies. As a   Buyer, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor   Clients that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase.   You should contact ChannelAdvisor Clients directly and review their privacy   policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such   as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>5) <strong>Bidding, Buying, Selling History. </strong>ChannelAdvisor may use any   information collected related to your bidding, buying or selling history to   generate recommendations and predictions related to likelihood of your   willingness to complete a bid and may submit such history and recommendations to   ChannelAdvisor Clients.</p>
              <p>6)<strong> Other Disclosures.</strong> ChannelAdvisor may disclose your personal   information if required to do so by law or if ChannelAdvisor has a good faith   belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect and/or defend the rights and   interests of ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor may, as permitted by applicable law,   disclose your personally identifiable information to ChannelAdvisor Clients,   other ChannelAdvisor users or third parties in connection with an investigation   of fraud, infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity and you expressly   authorize ChannelAdvisor to make such disclosures.</p>
              <p>7) <strong>Domestic and International Use.</strong> All personally identifying   information collected by ChannelAdvisor may be used in the United States or if   the Services are undertaken by ChannelAdvisor for a foreign ChannelAdvisor   Client, such information may be transferred to that ChannelAdvisor Client   outside of the United States and you consent to any such transfer of information   outside of your country. </p>
              <p>8) <strong>Merger or Acquisition. </strong>If ChannelAdvisor is merged or acquired by   another entity, personally identifiable information may be transferred to such   entity as a part of the merger or acquisition. </p>
              <p><strong>D. REVIEW AND MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING   INFORMATION.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If you are a ChannelAdvisor Client,</strong> you may add, modify or update your   personal information by accessing your account settings from the ChannelAdvisor   home page when you log in to the Services. Through your Personal Account   Settings, you may also determine how and when that personal information is   distributed. </p>
              <p><strong>If you are a Buyer <u>and</u> either (i) you have created a buyer profile,   or (ii) you opted to receive marketing information from ChannelAdvisor (see   Section C(3) above),</strong> you may access, modify, remove, correct or update your   personal information by contacting ChannelAdvisor as set forth in Section H   below. ChannelAdvisor may retain transactional history in order to document a   transaction you may have had with a ChannelAdvisor Client. You should contact   the ChannelAdvisor Client (for example, the seller of an item you have   purchased) directly in order to access, modify or update your personal   information with them.</p>
              <p><strong>E. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
              <p>As a part of the Services, ChannelAdvisor provides links to web sites   operated by third parties. ChannelAdvisor is not responsible for the information   collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party sites.</p>
              <p><strong>F. SECURITY</strong></p>
              <p>ChannelAdvisor stores personally identifiable information obtained through   registration securely and considers it part of the assets of its business. To   prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate   use of information, ChannelAdvisor has put in place physical, electronic, and   managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects   online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You   should consider any communication that you transmit to ChannelAdvisor (such as   data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and   agree that ChannelAdvisor will not be liable or responsible if information that   belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient. </p>
              <p><strong>G. CHILDREN</strong></p>
              <p>ChannelAdvisor uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose   individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The   Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any of   the Services. </p>
              <p><strong>H. FURTHER INFORMATION</strong></p>
