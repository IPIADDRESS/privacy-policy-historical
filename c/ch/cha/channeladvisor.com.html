                  <p>ChannelAdvisor Corporation ("<strong>ChannelAdvisor</strong>") provides   technology and services that enable industry-leading companies   ("<strong>ChannelAdvisor Client(s)</strong>") to use online marketplaces to   acquire customers ("<strong>Buyers</strong>") and maximize inventory yield.   ChannelAdvisor is committed to maintaining the privacy of its users, including   both ChannelAdvisor Customers and Buyers. If you have accessed this Privacy Policy   by clicking on the privacy policy link on a site other than the ChannelAdvisor   web site, your information may be collected by ChannelAdvisor as a service to   the entity that controls such other web site and the ChannelAdvisor privacy   policy terms will apply to the collection of your personal information.</p>
                  <p>This Privacy Policy describes the ChannelAdvisor practices for gathering,   storing, using and disseminating information. <strong>By visiting this website   you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you   do not agree with the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use or   access the ChannelAdvisor services. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you   expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable   information as outlined below.</strong> This policy may be changed from time to   time. All changes will be posted to this site and you are encouraged to   periodically check back to this site for any changes to the privacy policy.</p>
                  <p><strong>A. INFORMATION COLLECTION<br>
                        <br>
                    </strong>If you are using the online   marketplace services of ChannelAdvisor (the "Services"), whether through the   ChannelAdvisor website or a ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by   ChannelAdvisor, ChannelAdvisor may collect personal information about you   including billing and shipping addresses, credit card purchasing information,   product information and product order information. In addition, ChannelAdvisor   may also collect information about your bidding, buying and selling history as   well as third party comments regarding your bidding, buying and selling   behavior. Bidding and buying history may specifically include your history with   respect to any failure to complete sales on winning bids. ChannelAdvisor will   collect any comments you may send to ChannelAdvisor and any information you may   post to the ChannelAdvisor site or a ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by   ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor may also collect information through the use of   Cookies (as defined below).<br>
                    ChannelAdvisor collects personal information when   you: (1) register with ChannelAdvisor, (2) become a ChannelAdvisor Client, (3)   participate in an auction for a product listed by a ChannelAdvisor Client, (4)   complete a checkout page for a product purchased from a ChannelAdvisor Client,   (5) provide comments or submit a problem to ChannelAdvisor or a ChannelAdvisor   Client, (6) request information from ChannelAdvisor and provide your name or   return contact information, or (7) respond to special offers, contests or   surveys. As part of the registration or checkout process, you may be asked to   provide contact and billing information and other personally identifying   information. Providing some of the requested information is optional and   ChannelAdvisor will indicate what information is required and what information   is optional.</p>
                  <p><strong>B. COOKIES</strong><br>
                      <br>
                    "Cookies" are data files that may be   downloaded to your computer when you visit the ChannelAdvisor site or a   ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by ChannelAdvisor and permit the   ChannelAdvisor server to identify your browser whenever you interact with the   ChannelAdvisor site or a ChannelAdvisor Client site powered by ChannelAdvisor.   ChannelAdvisor uses cookies to recognize repeat visits by users of its site and   to collect information about its users' interactions with the Services. These   cookies contain identification information that enables us to streamline your   experiences using the Services. You may set your browser software to reject   cookies, but you will be required to reenter your login information each time   you access the Services, and you may not be able to optimize the features of the   Services. In some cases, you will not be able to access Services if cookies are   disabled. </p>
                  <p><strong>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING   INFORMATION<br>
                        <br>
                  </strong>1) <strong>Bidding and Buying Process. If you are a   Buyer</strong> and you are involved in a transaction with a ChannelAdvisor   Client (for example, a seller of an item you are purchasing), we share   personally identifiable information about you with that ChannelAdvisor Client in   order to assist you with the bidding and buying process as well as to assist   ChannelAdvisor Customers with the selling process. ChannelAdvisor will retain your   information at ChannelAdvisor to support the transaction. To the extent that   ChannelAdvisor Customers have access to your personally identifiable information,   these entities will treat this information in no less a secure manner than they   treat the personally identifiable information of customers who purchase directly   through the web site of that ChannelAdvisor Client. If you are a Buyer, you are   encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Customers that   provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. You should   contact ChannelAdvisor Customers directly and review their privacy policies should   you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for   example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.</p>
                  <p>2) <strong>Customer Support.</strong> Contact information provided by you in   connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those   problems, comments or requests and may be provided to ChannelAdvisor Customers or   third parties as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. </p>
                  <p>3) <strong>Marketing/Special offers/Solicitation from ChannelAdvisor. </strong>ChannelAdvisor may use registration information to provide updates, and   other business purposes related to making available the features and functions   of Services. ChannelAdvisor also may use registration information and checkout   information to make you aware of new products or special offers or promotions.   ChannelAdvisor will abide by requests from you (in accordance with the Section D   below) to discontinue such use. <strong>If you are a Buyer:</strong> (i) you   will receive such information as described in this Section C (3) only if you   have opted to receive such information from ChannelAdvisor as part of your   checkout process; (ii) you may opt out of receiving such information (if you   have already opted in to receive it) by sending a request in accordance with   Section D below. As a Buyer, if you receive communications directly from a   ChannelAdvisor Client, you should contact the ChannelAdvisor Client directly   concerning such communications and review their privacy policies.</p>
                  <p>4) <strong><strong>Providing Your Information to Third   Parties for Marketing/Solicitation. </strong></strong></p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>(i)<strong><strong> If you are a ChannelAdvisor Client   (not a "Buyer"), </strong></strong>ChannelAdvisor may provide certain   of your registration information to third parties for use in marketing and in   designing or providing their own services, to send you information about its   products and to notify you if you win a contest. You may opt-out of   ChannelAdvisor providing such information to third parties at any time by   updating your Personal Account Settings or by contacting ChannelAdvisor, as set   forth in Sections D and H below, respectively. You should contact the third   party directly who may already be sending you messages in order to request these   communications stop, and to review their privacy   policies.</p>
                    <p>(ii) <strong><strong>If you are a   Buyer,</strong></strong> <strong><strong>(1)</strong></strong> Channel Advisor does not sell your information to third parties for purposes of   marketing or soliciting you, <span class="style1">provided   however, we may share personally identifiable information, including credit or   debit account information, with a third party upon your prior consent</span>; and <strong><strong>(2)</strong></strong> To the extent that   ChannelAdvisor Customers (for example, a seller of an item you purchased) have   access to your personally identifiable information as a result of your bidding   or buying (reference C (1) above, where ChannelAdvisor provides your information   to ChannelAdvisor Customers as part of a transaction you may be involved in with   such ChannelAdvisor Client), these entities may solicit or market to you in   accordance with their policies. As a Buyer, you are encouraged to review the   privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Customers that provide the products or   services related to your bid or purchase. You should contact ChannelAdvisor   Customers directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions   concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications   you may or may not wish to receive.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                  <p>5) <strong>Bidding, Buying, Selling History. </strong>ChannelAdvisor may use   any information collected related to your bidding, buying or selling history to   generate recommendations and predictions related to likelihood of your   willingness to complete a bid and may submit such history and recommendations to   ChannelAdvisor Customers.</p>
                  <p>6)<strong> Other Disclosures.</strong> ChannelAdvisor may disclose your   personal information if required to do so by law or if ChannelAdvisor has a good   faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect and/or defend the   rights and interests of ChannelAdvisor. ChannelAdvisor may, as permitted by   applicable law, disclose your personally identifiable information to   ChannelAdvisor Customers, other ChannelAdvisor users or third parties in   connection with an investigation of fraud, infringement, piracy or other   unlawful activity and you expressly authorize ChannelAdvisor to make such   disclosures.</p>
                  <p>7) <strong>Domestic and International Use.</strong> All personally   identifying information collected by ChannelAdvisor may be used in the United   States or if the Services are undertaken by ChannelAdvisor for a foreign   ChannelAdvisor Client, such information may be transferred to that   ChannelAdvisor Client outside of the United States and you consent to any such   transfer of information outside of your country. </p>
                  <p>8) <strong>Merger or Acquisition. </strong>If ChannelAdvisor is merged or   acquired by another entity, personally identifiable information may be   transferred to such entity as a part of the merger or acquisition. </p>
                  <p><strong>D. REVIEW AND MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING   INFORMATION.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>If you are a ChannelAdvisor Client,</strong> you may add, modify or   update your personal information by accessing your account settings from the   ChannelAdvisor home page when you log in to the Services. Through your Personal   Account Settings, you may also determine how and when that personal information   is distributed. </p>
                  <p><strong>If you are a Buyer <u>and</u> either (i) you have created a buyer   profile, or (ii) you opted to receive marketing information from ChannelAdvisor   (see Section C(3) above),</strong> you may access, modify, remove, correct or   update your personal information by contacting ChannelAdvisor as set forth in   Section H below. ChannelAdvisor may retain transactional history in order to   document a transaction you may have had with a ChannelAdvisor Client. You should   contact the ChannelAdvisor Client (for example, the seller of an item you have   purchased) directly in order to access, modify or update your personal   information with them.</p>
                  <p><strong>E. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
                  <p>As a part of the Services, ChannelAdvisor provides links to web sites   operated by third parties. ChannelAdvisor is not responsible for the information   collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party sites.</p>
                  <p><strong>F. SECURITY</strong></p>
                  <p>ChannelAdvisor stores personally identifiable information obtained through   registration securely and considers it part of the assets of its business. To   prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate   use of information, ChannelAdvisor has put in place physical, electronic, and   managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects   online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You   should consider any communication that you transmit to ChannelAdvisor (such as   data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and   agree that ChannelAdvisor will not be liable or responsible if information that   belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient. </p>
                  <p><strong>G. CHILDREN</strong></p>
                  <p>ChannelAdvisor uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose   individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The   Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any of   the Services. </p>
