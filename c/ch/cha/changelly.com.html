The rates remain approximate until the transaction is actually made on the blockchain, which is why the exchange rate at the time of a transaction may differ slightly from the estimated rate that you see when you begin a transaction. To learn more about the process, see {link}","link":"this article"},"trust":{"title":"Why should I trust you?","first-section":"Changelly is one of the most prominent instant cryptocurrency exchanges that has gained the trust of more than 2M users from all over the world.

Mobile app users will no longer be affected by the risks associated with crypto market fluctuations. Soon, the fixed-rate exchanges will also be implemented on the web version. To lock the current exchange rate, the user needs to click on the lock icon, which will result in them getting the exact same amount of crypto as is displayed on the screen. The rate is fixed for 15 minutes, which should be more than enough to carry out the exchange.","second-section":"Alternatively, Changelly offers our lowest fee of 0.25% for all crypto-to-crypto exchanges made at a floating rate."}},"accounts":{"title":"Accounts","enter-email":{"title":"Why do I need to enter my email?","first-section":"Your email is required to create an account that grants you access to your transaction history, password editing and other account settings.

A wallet address is a randomly generated combination of digits and letters that is associated with a particular wallet.","second-section":"Changelly does not provide wallet addresses and never stores user deposits. To exchange cryptocurrencies on Changelly, you need to provide a previously-existing wallet address where you can receive your exchanged currency."},"get-wallet":{"title":"How do I get a wallet address?","first-section":"Just figure out what coin you want to buy and look for a stable compatible wallet. As a rule, each coin has its official wallet client.","second-section":"Note that each wallet has its unique address or a tag with a private key that is required to restore your wallet if you lose it. Changelly will never asks for your private keys. Store them in a safe place and never show them to anyone. If your private keys are stolen, your wallet and all your coins will be lost forever."},"recipient-address":{"title":"What's the recipient’s address?","first-section":"In any transaction there is always a sender and a recipient. The recipient’s address is the wallet address where you will receive the currency you buy. For example, if you want to buy Ether (ETH), you should specify an ETH wallet address in the recipient field, and Changelly will send coins to this address once the transaction is complete.","second-section":"In general, the recipient’s wallet address is a customer's address Changelly will send coins to once a transaction is complete."},"whats-hash":{"title":"What is a hash?","first-section":"A hash (or tx ID) is the unique address of a transaction in a blockchain that acts as a record or proof that the transaction has taken place. Usually, the hash is a combination of digits and lowercase letters (uppercase in the case of XRP). Whenever you make a payment in cryptocurrency, you receive a hash displayed in your wallet. It looks like this:","second-section":"Every hash should be located in a blockchain. If you have any issues with a transaction on our platform, our support team may ask you to provide the hash for the transaction in order to find your payment and resolve the issue.","third-section":"If you do not know where to find the hash, please address the wallet support or FAQ."},"buying":{"title":"How do I buy coins?","first-section":"The exchange process is the same for all coins available on Changelly:","list-items":{"one":"Go to {link}. Select the coin you want to exchange from (i.e. the one you already have) from the upper field, and the coin you want to buy (i.e. the one you will receive) from the lower field. Click the ‘Exchange Now’ button.","two":"Double check the amount specified, the amount you want to get, and click the ‘Next step’ button.","three":"Specify the recipient wallet address and click Next step.","four":"Once again, double check everything carefully. Note that the final amount is estimated, so it may be slightly more or less at the end of your transaction. If everything looks OK, proceed to the next step by clicking ‘Confirm and make payment’.","five":"Now your transaction has been created. You will see a QR code and a wallet address below. This is the address to which you will send us the currency you want to exchange. Go to the wallet where you’re storing the currency you want to exchange and paste this address into the corresponding field. If you use a mobile wallet app, you can just scan the QR code we provide. As soon as we receive your money, we’ll exchange it and send it to the recipient address you provided in step 2.","six":"You can see the status of your transaction in your transaction history. We will notify you as soon as your transaction is completed. Transactions are usually completed within 5-30 minutes. In some cases, waiting time may increase due to network delays.","seven":"After a transaction is finished, you get a receipt with an output transaction hash. This hash is a proof that your transaction is completed."}},"max-min":{"title":"What is the maximal/minimal amount?","section-one":"Changelly doesn’t have set amount restrictions. However, there are some cases when a minimum amount applies:","section-two":"If an amount is very low, make sure that it will cover all costs required by a blockchain. This means that the amount you are going to send and the amount you are going to receive should be enough to cover input and output network fees taken by a blockchain.","section-three":"If your funds to be exchanged are insufficient, you will see a message like this.","section-four":"Please follow the amount recommendations we provide. Otherwise, there is a high risk that your transaction will not go through and your money will be lost.","section-five":"For large amounts, there are no restrictions at all. You’re free to exchange as large a sum as you want. Note that in this case the time of transaction processing will depend on the capacity of the blockchain and the amount of network fees set by your wallet.","section-six":"Tip: in order to prevent market pump/dump, divide a large amount into smaller ones and wait for a couple of hours between sending them. In this case you will not create an overwhelming demand for a currency you want to buy, so that its final rate will be much more profitable."},"network-fees":{"title":"What are network fees?","first-section":"Each time any amount of cryptocurrency is sent or exchanged, the currency goes through a blockchain. This process requires a small fee called a ‘network fee’. The network fee is a commission that a blockchain takes from the amount sent in each currency. It is critical to make sure that the amount you want to exchange on Changelly is enough to cover the exchange fees for both the process of sending your original currency and receiving the new currency you want to buy. If the sent amount is too low to cover the fees of the network, the transaction will not go through and your funds will be lost.","second-section":"Learn about network fees {link}","link":"in this article"},"cancel-tx":{"title":"How do I cancel my transaction?","first-section":"Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible. Once a transaction is made (money is sent to a particular wallet address), it cannot be rolled back. So, if you are going to exchange cryptocurrency, be sure to double check all payment details carefully before sending."},"final-amount":{"title":"Why is my final amount different?","first-section":"All transactions take time to be processed (usually 5-30 minutes). Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the exchange rate is subject to change during the processing time, which means the final rate may be slightly different from what you expected. This happens because Changelly doesn’t fix {link}","link":"currency rates"},"receiving":{"title":"When should I receive my money?","first-section":"Changelly transactions take 5-30 minutes to be processed. If a transaction is large (worth over 1 BTC), processing may take longer, depending on the size of your transaction and blockchain capacity."},"invalid-wallet":{"title":"Why is my wallet address recognized as invalid?","first-section":"Changelly supports most wallets. If your wallet address is recognized as invalid, it is usually for one of the following reasons:","list-items":{"first":"Make sure your wallet address matches the chosen cryptocurrency.","second":"You haven't updated or synced your BCH ABC wallet with a blockchain yet.","third":"There was a typo or character missing in the address you provided. Make sure that the address you specify matches the actual address of your wallet."}},"tx-too-long":{"title":"Why does my transaction take so long?","first-section":"As a rule our transactions take 5-30 minutes to be processed. It your transaction takes longer, this could be due to a variety of factors, including:","list-items":{"first":"Blockchain overload. There are many transactions waiting to go through, including yours. This issue occurs on the Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based blockchains. Unfortunately, the only thing to do is wait. Changelly has no control over a blockchain overload.","second":"Coin updates. We may turn off some coins to update a client. This can take some time. You will get your money as soon as we turn it back on.","third":"DDoS attacks. Every platform is subject to such attacks. Unfortunately, in this case the only thing to do is wait it out.","fourth":"You can read a more detailed explanation of each of the above issues in this article: {link}"},"link":"About delays."},"still-waiting":{"title":"Why is my transaction still waiting for payment if I've already paid?","first-section":"There are several reasons this might be happening:","list-items":{"one":"The transaction hasn't been included in a block. Cryptocurrencies aren't stable, so minor errors sometimes occur. If this happens we will either refund you your money or push the payment through if you can provide the hash (a tx ID) of your transaction.","two":"ETC and ETH confusion. The addresses of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) have the same structure. If you send ETC or ETH, make sure that you've selected the appropriate transaction type on Changelly. For example, if you create an ETH to BTC transaction, make sure that you send ETH, not ETC. Otherwise your transaction will get stuck.","three":"Wrong or missing XEM message. While sending XEM, make sure that you've put the correct message. It's indicated here and looks like a combination of digits and letters. Messages like 'Hey how are you’,  or ‘I love Changelly' are lovely but won’t work, unfortunately.","four":"In case you indicated or forgot to put the valid destination tag for XRP or the valid memo for EOS/Stellar, the transaction won't be processed automatically and you'll have to contact our support team in order for your transaction to be either pushed or refunded manually.","five":"Other internal errors. Even our well-made system can experience lag or other internal issues. If you think this may be the case, please report it to {link}"}},"redeeming":{"title":"What does ‘Not yet redeemed?’ mean","first-section":"In the DASH, DOGE or other Bitcoin based blockchains, you may see the status of your transaction as ‘Not yet redeemed’. It means that your transaction is complete, but it hasn't been used as input for another transaction. In other words, your coins are received, but you haven’t spent it yet. You need to update and sync your wallet in order to see the coins reflected in your wallet."},"direct-sending":{"title":"Can I send coins directly to your wallet without creating a new transaction?","first-section":"All wallet addresses (including memos, destination tags and messages) provided by Changelly are reusable and tied to your {firstLink}. You can send multiple amount of coins to the address generated {secondLink} without creating a new transaction on Changelly. In this case, your coins sent will be automatically exchanged to the same currency and sent to the same wallet address.","firstLink":"recipient address","secondLink":"before"},"hard-fork":{"title":"What is hard fork?","first-section":"A hard fork is a mandatory blockchain update that conflicts with the older version. In other words, you cannot use the currency anymore unless you haven’t upgraded the client. The reason of a hard fork can be fixes for a major bug or blockchain improvements. Hard forks should be supported by all members of the crypto community, otherwise it can lead to blockchain replication."}},"extraId":{"title":"Destination tags, memos and messages","memo":{"title":"What is a memo?","first-section":"A memo is a combination of digits and letters required to assign Stellar to a certain Stellar wallet user. Memos are used in Stellar and EOS wallets and indicated right here.","second-section":"In wallet, a memo should look like this.","third-section":"If you want to buy Steems, make sure that you've specified a correct memo while putting in a wallet address."},"tag":{"title":"What is a destination tag?","first-section":"A destination tag is a short complementary combination of characters required for certain XRP wallets. When buying XRP, make sure that you have specified a destination tag, if required. Likewise, when you send XRP to us, do not forget to include the destination tag, provided near the address you should send to."},"message":{"title":"What is a message?","first-section":"A message is an additional tag that is obligatory for certain XEM wallets. When you send or receive XEM, make sure that you input a message if required. Basically, the message should look like this:"}},"bank-cards":{"title":"Bank card payments","we-accept":{"title":"What currencies does Changelly accept?","first-section":"All bank card transactions are provided by Simplex and Indacoin.
