<p>At ChaCha we recognize that your privacy is important to you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of the ChaCha websites (the “Site”) as well as any of the services, products, software and applications offered by ChaCha (the “Services”), including our online and mobile services.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy summarizes ChaCha’s privacy practices and the uses of the information that ChaCha gathers via the Site and the Services. This Privacy Policy applies to ChaCha Search, Inc., subsidiaries and affiliates, its successors and assigns (collectively “ChaCha”). Please note that ChaCha may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you should check this page periodically for changes. If changes are made, ChaCha will notify users by stating the date the Privacy Policy change is effective. If significant changes to the Privacy Policy are made, it will be prominently indicated on the Site.</p>
