            <p>
                Roger Wilco LLC (“Chatra”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users using Chatra software applications, application programming interfaces, Chatra Webhooks, communication services, networks, and websites, including, but not limited to chatra.io and app.chatra.io (the “Site”).
            </p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site.
                This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
                We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the chatra.io.
                You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.
                Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Chatra Terms of Service, accessible at https://chatra.io/terms-of-service/.
            </p>

            <p>
                As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to this Privacy Policy, we have a separate <a href="https://chatra.io/dpa/">Data Processing Amendment</a> that contains further information for customers and service providers.
            </p>

            <p>
                We use the term “customers” for individuals and businesses who have signed up for a Chatra account, and handle information received from them under the terms of the Chatra Data Processing Amendment.
            </p>

            <p>
                “End users” refers to individuals using goods and services provided by Chatra customers. For example, individuals who use Chatra when seeking assistance for a particular product or service via live chat are likely to be end users.
            </p>

            <p>
                “End user data” (which describes data about end users of Chatra customers) includes but is not limited to first names, last names, phone numbers and email addresses. It’s only used by us to identify you to Chatra customers so they can provide you with customer service, ensuring that they’re able to help you in the way(s) you require.
            </p>

            <p>
                For more information on how we process data on behalf of Chatra customers, please see our <a href="https://chatra.io/dpa/">Data Processing Amendment</a>.

            <h2>
                Information Collection and Use
            </h2>

            <p>
                Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Service.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Personally Identifiable Information
            </h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the course of using the Service, we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you; personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, email address, postal address, phone number, profile photo, and credit card number and other billing information (“Personal Information”).
                </li>

                <li>
                    We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and personalization of your Account (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) history of purchases you make via the Site and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).
                </li>
                <li>
                    We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Chatra Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with chatra newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)
                </li>
            </ol>


            <h3>
                Log Data
            </h3>

            <p>
                When you visit the Site, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “chatra User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data (besides IP) as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
            </p>




            <h3>
                Cookies
            </h3>

            <p>
                Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information and preferences for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Chatra Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.
            </p>

            <p>
                To ensure the functionality of our chat software and to allow the identification of users when they return to our Site, we save user identification token and other information to the local storage and/or cookie in your browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                This includes, but is not limited to, the persisted state, machine state, session ID as well as chat statistics, URLs visited on our website, an individual user ID, the name of the user, the email-address and the number of visits. These tokens are stored locally and are not shared with third parties. By default this information is stored indefinitely.
            </p>

            <p>
                These cookies/local storage entries have key-value storage names that differ from session to session.
