    </div>
    <a name="top"></a>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the website us.changyou.com  and other websites associated with such URL (collectively the “Website”)  operated by Changyou.com (US), Inc. (“CHANGYOU”). By using the Website, you  consent to the practices described herein. We may update this Privacy Policy  from time to time to reflect company and customer feedback. You should  periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of our practices. Your  continued use of the Website following any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes  your acceptance of those changes. </p>
    <h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
    <p> CHANGYOU collects personal identifiable information, such as  your name, address, telephone number, and email address (“Personal  Information”). We also collect anonymous demographic and usage pattern  information which is not unique to you, such as your geographic area, age,  gender, preferences, interests, favorites, log-in frequency, purchase history,  and usage history. This demographic and usage pattern information is not considered  Personal Information except when it is used in conjunction with other  information that personally identifies you.</p>
    
    <p> When you access or use the Website and any features contained therein, we also  automatically collect technical information about your computer hardware and  software. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain  names, access times, and referring web site addresses, etc. This technical  information is not considered Personal Information except when it is used in conjunction  with other information that personally identifies you.</p>
    
    <p> We may aggregate your demographic and/or technical information to help us  understand our users’ trends and needs, and to improve the quality of our  services. Such aggregated data will remove personally-identifying information  and will not be considered Personal Information.</p>
    
    <p> Please keep in mind that any information you post on or send through the  Website’s discussion forums, chat rooms, or messaging functions is publicly  available and not confidential. If you disclose your Personal Information or  other personally sensitive data through such channels, it may be collected and  used by others, and CHANGYOU shall not be liable for any resulting claims,  losses, or damages.</p>
    
    <p> Please also note that when you visit third-party websites linked to or from the  Website, any information you disclose on those third-party websites is subject  to their privacy policies and practices. CHANGYOU shall not be responsible for  the practices of any third-party websites. You should carefully review each  third-party website’s privacy policy. </p>
    <h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>
    <p> We use your Personal Information to: (a) operate the Website  and provide the services we offer; (b) deliver the services you request; (c)  provide technical support; (d) verify any online payment, telephone payment,  and pre-paid card transactions, which are solely processed through third-party  service providers with their own privacy policies for which we are not  responsible; (e) investigate alleged fraud, infringement, or other misconduct;  (f) send you newsletters; and (g) inform you about other products, services,  events, and promotions available from CHANGYOU or its affiliates. We may also  use your Personal Information to contact you via surveys or other research  regarding your opinion of any current and potential services.</p>
    
    <p> We may share Personal Information with our service providers who need access to  such information in order to complete the work they have been engaged to do. In  some cases, such service providers may directly collect Personal Information  from you on our behalf. Although we require such service providers to safeguard  any Personal Information received from us or collected on our behalf, we are  not responsible or liable in any way for the acts or failure to act by any such  service providers.</p>
    
    <p> If you opt-in to receive newsletters, announcements, or advertisements of any  kind from our business partners, we may share your Personal Information with  such third parties, so that they can directly contact you regarding such  offers. You may opt-out of any marketing offers from us or our business  partners by informing us during your account sign-up process or through  communications to us via email at service@us.changyou.com. Your opt-out does  not apply to communications from CHANGYOU regarding any changes or updates to  your account, or the non-marketing use of your Personal Information as  described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <p> We may disclose your Personal Information without notice if required to do so  by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a)  conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us; (b)  protect and defend the rights or property of CHANGYOU; and (c) act under  exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Website or  the public. </p>
    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
    <p> The Website uses "cookies" to save you time and  personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on  your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or  deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can  only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. A  cookie tells the web server that you have returned to a specific page and helps  the web server to recall your customized features. Information transmitted  through cookies is not considered Personal Information unless it contains  information that personally identifies you.</p>
    
    <p> You have the ability to accept or decline cookies; please refer to your web  browser’s instructions. However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not  be able to experience certain interactive features of the Website.</p>
    
    <p> We may use third parties to better understand your user preferences and deliver  targeted advertisements to you. These third parties may also place cookies on  your computer. This policy does not apply to, and CHANGYOU is not responsible  for, cookies placed or data collected by such third parties. </p>
    <h3>Monitoring</h3>
    <p> We may, but are not obligated to, monitor and retain any and  all data you transmit through our servers, including without limitation  communications sent through or posted on the Website’s discussion forums, chat  rooms, and messaging functions, whether or not marked “private” by you. You  acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy with respect to  any such data transmitted, and you consent to any monitoring we may conduct. </p>
    <h3> Security of your Personal Information</h3>
    <p> We use commercially reasonable efforts to secure your Personal  Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We secure the  Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure  environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also  use industry-standard encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)  protocol, to protect certain kinds of information transmitted through the  Website, such as your account password. Unfortunately, there are many factors  beyond our control that could result in disclosure of Personal Information or  any other information that you provide to us, and no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot ensure,  and we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to, the security of  any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. </p>
    <h3> Updating your Personal Information</h3>
    <p> You may review, correct, update, or delete your Personal  Information maintained by us. Please provide us with sufficient proof of your  identity and appropriate documentation of corrections to be made. You can  contact us at:</p>
    <p> Changyou.com (US), Inc.<br> 2700 Augustine Dr, Ste 165<br> Santa Clara, CA, 95054<br>[Email: <a href="mailto:service@us.changyou.com">service@us.changyou.com</a>]</p>
    
    <p> Please note that certain Personal Information, such as your date of birth or  age, cannot be deleted unless you cancel your account. We also reserve the  right to retain your Personal Information after account cancellation if such  information is necessary to resolve any disputes or to comply with legal  requirements. </p>
    <p> <strong>Children</strong></p>
    <p> We do not solicit or knowingly collect any information from  children under the age of 13, and you must be at least 13 years of age to use  the services provided by the Website, including creating a user account. We  encourage parents to obtain additional information about safe use of the  Internet at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy/" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy/</a>, and to instruct your children not  to disclose any Personal Information without first consulting with their  parents. </p>
    <p> <strong>Contact Information</strong></p>
