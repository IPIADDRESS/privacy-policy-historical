          <h2 align="center"><strong>Changemakers Privacy Policy</strong></h2> <h3>Introduction</h3> <p>The privacy of your personal information is  important to Ashoka (“Changemakers” or “we”). This privacy policy (this  “Privacy Policy”) is provided to explain our online information practices and  the choices you can make about the way that your personally identifiable  information (“Personal Information”) is collected and used at the Changemakers website  and all other websites owned or controlled by Changemakers (collectively, the  “Site”).<br>   If you are an employee of Changemakers or  its affiliates, please note that other internal company policies apply to you  related to employee use of company computer systems and networks.<br>   Please note that by using the Site, you agree  to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy  Policy is effective as of March 23, 2010.</p> <h3>Passive Information Collection; Cookies</h3> <p>A cookie is a text-only piece of  information that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk so that the  website can remember who you are. A cookie will normally contain the name of  the internet domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of  the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. We use  cookies to evaluate the general use of the Site. We also use cookies to  identify who you are after you log in or register so that we can tailor your  personal preferences for a more personalized experience. Cookies also insure  that the appearance of the Site conforms to your Internet browser. You usually  can configure your Internet browser to reject cookies. However, if you do so,  you might not be able to access certain pages or use important functions on the  Site. We reserve the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and  techniques related to the use of the Site. In general, we do not link your  identity with information that we collect passively. However, in any situation  where you log in with your username and password, any or all of the information  that is passively collected about your activities on the Site may be linked  with your identity, and therefore may become Personal Information about you.<br>   To learn more about cookies and other  passive tracking technologies and how they may be used on your computer, please  read the help information supplied with your Internet browser software.</p> <h3>Active Information Collection</h3> <p>In general, when you visit the Site you  remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to provide Personal Information  to register, enter a competition, contact us, and conduct other activities and  transactions via the Site. The types of Personal Information collected at the  Site may include any or all of the following, depending on your activities on  the Site: name, address, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, website,  organization (including the organization’s name, website, phone number, and  address), username, password, language, photograph and other Personal  Information that you actively provide to us via the Site.<br>   We also enable you to submit Personal Information  about other people. For example, we request that you provide us with such  information about individuals who you wish to nominate for a competition  sponsored by Changemakers, or to use as references, or who may be interested in  hearing about Changemakers. The following types of Personal Information may be  collected about such persons: name, organization name, email address, phone  number, city, and country.</p> <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3> <p>We use and disclose Personal Information to  provide information about our organization, our competitions, or other issues  of interest.<br>   Except as provided herein, WE WILL NOT SELL  ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE THROUGH THE SITE WITHOUT YOUR PRIOR WRITTEN  CONSENT. We may use Personal Information that you provide to update you on our  activities, let you know about new projects and competitions that we believe  may be of interest to you, and contact you about the outcome of competitions.  If you do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact us  at <a title="Linkification: mailto:connect@changemakers.com" href="mailto:connect@changemakers.com" class="linkification-ext">connect@changemakers.com</a>.<br>   From time to time, we may share certain  Personal Information with other non-profits to enable them to share information  that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share Personal  Information with these entities, please contact us at<a href="mailto:privacy@changemakers.net"> </a><a href="mailto:connect@changemakers.com">connect@changemakers.com</a> and we will take  reasonable measures to avoid sharing such information in the future. Please  note that these other parties are sometimes independent from Changemakers, and  if your information has already been shared with such parties and you wish to  stop all communications from such parties and/or stop any use of the shared  information by such parties, you will need to address such issues with them  directly. <br>   We may share Personal Information with our  partners, affiliates, consultants, suppliers, and providers. We require that  these entities keep your Personal Information confidential and only use your  Personal Information to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not  for any other purpose. <br>   We may disclose Personal Information in  response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law  requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or a law  enforcement agency's request. We also reserve the right to disclose Personal  Information to protect the security of the Site, and to protect ourselves and our  partners, affiliates, consultants, suppliers, and providers against liability.&nbsp; <br>   In the event that Changemakers or a  significant portion of Changemakers’ assets or business is sold, assigned,  merged, or otherwise transferred, Changemakers may transfer your Personal  Information as a part of the transaction. In the event such a transfer occurs, Changemakers  will use reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information subject to the  same protection as it was prior to the transfer. In the event that your  Personal Information becomes subject to a different privacy policy,  Changemakers will use reasonable efforts to notify you of such change. <br>   The Site is not directed to children and Changemakers does not  knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13.</p> <h3>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h3> <p>If you are a registered user of the Site,  you can access and correct certain Personal Information that we collect online  and maintain by clicking on "sign in" and entering your username and  password. If any errors in your Personal Information cannot be corrected by  accessing your account or if you have other questions related to updating or  changing your account information, please contact us using the contact  information below. You may also contact us using the information below to ask  us to remove your Personal Information from our records, electronic or  otherwise.</p> <h3>Use of Anonymous Information</h3> <p>The Site's web servers collect anonymous  logs during user visits to the Site. This information is used to create  aggregate statistics, for example, when the Site is accessed, the pages which  refer visitors to the Site, the type of web browsers visitors use, and which  pages of the Site are viewed. These statistics help us understand how the Site  is used and provide us with valuable information for improving the Site in the  future. From time to time, we may share such aggregate, non-personally  identifiable statistical information with ­­advertisers and our partners,  affiliates, consultants, suppliers, and providers. The type and amount of  information we receive and store depends on how you use the Site. You can  access most of our pages without telling us who you are and without revealing  any Personal Information.</p> <h3>Security</h3> <p>Changemakers tries very hard to protect our  users' Personal Information. Though Changemakers strives to protect this  information, no transmission of data is completely secure. Changemakers will  not be liable under any circumstances for damages resulting from use of  information collected from you or any other visitors to the Site. When you  access your account information, we usually offer the use of a secure server.  The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) of your Internet browser which encrypts the Personal  Information you input before it is sent to us and seeks to prevent anyone from  reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours.<br>   You should be aware that when you  voluntarily disclose Personal Information via competition entries, messages,  forums, postings, or in other areas of the Site, that information, along with  any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected  and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages  from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of  Changemakers.&nbsp; Please do not post any  Personal Information on the Site that you expect to keep private.</p> <h3>Usernames and Passwords</h3> <p>It is your responsibility to safeguard any  username or password that you have received in connection with the Site, and to  notify us if you ever suspect that the security and confidentiality of such  username or password has been compromised in any way. You are solely  responsible for any use of the Site via your username and password.</p> <h3>Links</h3> <p>Please note that third parties may also  collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you  link to their websites through the Site. We do not monitor or control the  information collection or privacy practices of these or any other third  parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their  websites. If you are concerned about how third parties collect and use  information, please review their privacy practices posted on their websites.</p> <h3>Changes to Changemakers Privacy Policy</h3> <p>Our privacy practices, like the online  medium itself, are subject to change. Changemakers may, in its sole discretion,  change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the way we collect  and use Personal Information in the future. Please check this Privacy Policy  frequently and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information  via the Site. All revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site  via a link from the home page of the Site. Your continued use of the Site after  changes in this Privacy Policy indicates your assent to such changes.</p> <h3>International Users</h3> <p>Changemakers collects, processes, stores,  discloses, and disposes of Personal Information that you submit to us in  accordance with applicable United States law. Please note that the Personal Information  you submit to the Site will be transferred to the United States to be processed  by Changemakers in order to provide the Site and its services to you or for  such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you are not a  resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect  and use your Personal Information, as discussed in this Privacy Policy, outside  your resident jurisdiction. In addition, we may store such Personal Information  in the United States, outside your resident jurisdiction. In particular, you  are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection  that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and  self-regulation. Please be aware that United States law may offer different  levels of protection for Personal Information than may be available in your  country.</p> <h3>How to Contact Us</h3> <p>Your privacy is very important to us.  Should you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please  address them to:<br>   Changemakers<br>   1700 North Moore Street<br>   Suite 2000<br>   Arlington, VA 22209<br>   You may also send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@changemakers.net">connect@changemakers.com</a>.</p>    </div>
