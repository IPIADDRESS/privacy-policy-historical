                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For Customers specifically, We collect and store personal information that our Customers submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service.</p>

                <p>If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer’s phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.</p>

                <p>We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers’ use of the Service. Customers’ sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Customer's account.</p>

                <p>We also collect Customers’ user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.</p>

                <p>Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers can opt-out of marketing emails by adjusting their account settings, but we may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts.</p>

                <u>Users of Customer Websites</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For end users of Customer Websites, when an end user visits a Customer Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type. Their session on the Customer Website will be tracked, but each user will remain anonymous. We may use their IP address to identify the general geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information. We also use this information for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends.</p>

                <p>As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose to activate the Service. In connection with the collection of this Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any personal information from users of Customer Websites, provided that (i) Chartbeat does collect IP addresses from visitors to Customer Websites in order to show geolocation information, and (ii) the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Chartbeat, so that URLs containing personal information of end users are not captured by the Service.</p>

                <p>Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and uptime monitoring. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but Chartbeat will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior consent.</p>

                <p>We also collect and use browser header information to help Us understand from which websites a user navigates to a Customer Website.</p>

                <p>Chartbeat is not and shall not be liable for any collection or use of personal information of end users of a Customer Website due to a Customer’s placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer website not in accordance with Chartbeat’s instructions or the documentation.</p>

                  <p>For all types of personal information (from users of our Site, Customers and end users of Customer Websites), We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share personal information with them to provide our products and services. Examples include billing, technical assistance, and customer service. Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Chartbeat’s agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Any agent that we share your personal information with must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the personal information that are no less protective than those set out in this policy.</p>

                  <u>Business Transfers</u>
                  <p>In some cases, Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, information about Customers as well as aggregated and anonymized data is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Chartbeat, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Chartbeat may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <u>Public authorities</u>
                  <p>In some cases, Chartbeat may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Chartbeat remains potentially liable if third party processing personal information received from the European Union or Switzerland on its behalf processes that personal information in a manner which is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).</p>

                <u>Our site.</u>
                <p>We may use cookies in connection with third party services to run analytics on Our Site; these cookies do not collect or use any personal information about users of Our Site or Service.</p>

                <u>Customers' Websites</u>
                <p>We also use cookies on Customer Websites; these cookies help Us understand how users interact with those Customer Websites. Cookies also allow Us to improve the Service.</p>

                <p>If a Customer does not allow the placement of Chartbeat cookies on its Customer Website, the “new vs. returning user” data point in its Chartbeat dashboard will not be accurately reported.

              <li>
                <u>Disabling cookies.</u>
                <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you will not be able to use the Service.</p>

              <li>
                <b>For our European Customers where the EU ePrivacy Directive applies:</b>
                <p>Chartbeat uses two cookies. One cookie (_chartbeat2) is used to register whether a user has visited the Customer Website before (to calculate “new vs returning” users). The other (_SUPERFLY_nosample) is used only if a Customer exceeds its plan’s traffic limit. When the traffic limit is reached the cookie is set and will disable the beacon from that Customer for one hour. The chartbeat2 cookie will remain valid as to any given website visitor or user, until the user elects to disable it. The SUPERFLY_nosample cookie is valid for one hour.</p>
