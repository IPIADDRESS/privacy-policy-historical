<h2>
    b. Customers (those who use the Chartbeat Product)
</h2>
<p>
    For Customers specifically, We collect and store Personal Data that Our
    Customers submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses and
    billing information, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service
    and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the
    Customer's phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the
    Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.
</p>
<p>
    We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and
    browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and
    other uses related to Customers' use of the Service. Customers' sessions on
    Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track
    user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Customer's
    account.
</p>
<p>
    We also collect Customers' user ID and password information to enable them
    to log into and use the Service.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails
    from us when they register for the Service. Customers can opt-out of
    marketing emails by utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein, but
    We may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Customer Visitors (individuals who visit publisher 's websites)
</h2>
<p>
    For Customer Visitors, when a Customer Visitor visits a Customer Website,
    We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website,
    such as their IP address and browser type on behalf of our Customer. Their
    session on the Customer Website will be tracked. We may use their IP
    address to identify the general geographic area from which they are
    accessing the Customer Website. We remove the last octet of the IP address
    and therefore do not store IP addresses or link IP addresses to any
    Personal Data. We also use this information for systems administration
    purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends in connection with Our
    provision of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the
    Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose to activate
    the Service. In connection with the collection of this Traffic Data,
    Chartbeat does not collect any Personal Data from Customer Visitors, (i) so
    long as the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website
    in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Us, so
    that URLs containing Personal Data of Customer Visitors are not captured by
    the Service, and (ii) provided that We do collect IP addresses from
    Customer Visitors in order to show geolocation information but We remove
    the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses in
    a manner that would permit personal identification.
</p>
<p>
    Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and
    uptime monitoring. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that
    from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but
    We will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that
    reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the
    Customer's express prior consent.
</p>
<p>
    We also collect first party cookie IDs on behalf of Customers. Chartbeat
    code, by default, sets and reads a cookie on the Customer's website domain
    containing a randomly-generated user ID for purposes of determining unique
    visitor counts and visitors' loyalty to a site. Such information can be
    classified as Personal Data under the European General Data Protection
    Regulation but it is not stored in a manner that would permit personal
    identification.
</p>
<p>
    We also collect and use browser header information to help Us understand
    from which websites a Customer Visitor navigates to a Customer Website.
</p>
<p>
    Our Customers are required to: (a) make appropriate disclosures using the
    Customer's privacy policy or via statements on the Customer's website(s);
    and (b) obtain all Customer Visitors' consent to the use of cookies, if
    applicable, as required by law. Chartbeat is not and shall not be liable
    for any collection or use of Personal Data of Customer Visitors due to a
    Customer's placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website not in
    accordance with Chartbeat's instructions or documentation.
</p>
<h2>
    4. OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
</h2>
<p>
    We consider that the legal bases for using your Personal Data as set out in
    this Privacy Policy are as follows:
</p>
<h2>
    a. Chartbeat Site Visitors

    identify visitors, administer the Service; (v) make product decisions; (vi)
    notify visitors of changes or updates to the Site; (vii) for systems
    administration purposes; and (viii) to track visitor trends.
</p>
</h2><h2>
    b. Customers
</h2>
<p>
    <u>Our use of your Personal Data is necessary</u>:
</p>
<p>
    1. .to perform Our obligations in connection with the Terms of Use which
    you accept by using the Service and/or to comply with Our contract to
    provide Services to you or (if you are an employee of a Customer) your
    employer; or
</p>
<p>
    2. for Our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for
    example to ensure the security of Our Site). Our legitimate interest are
    to: (i) run, grow and develop Our business; (ii) operate Our Site; (iii)
    allow Us to identify Customers; (iv) provide the Service; (v) notify
    Customers of changes or updates to the Service; (vi) contact you in account
    recovery and other scenarios; (viii) assist in login and other uses related
    to Customers' use of the Service; (ix) perform systems administration
    activities; (x) track visitor trends; (xi) enable you to log into and use
    the Service; (xii) send marketing emails; (xiii) send account related
    emails.
</p>
<p>
    3. If we rely on your consent for us to use your Personal Data in a
    particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your
    consent by contacting us at privacy@chartbeat.com and we will stop doing
    so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for
    us to be able to provide Our Services
</p>
<h2>
    c. Customer Website Visitors
</h2>
<p>
    We are processors of information about Customer Visitors and therefore are
    not strictly required to provide information about the legal basis on which
    We use Personal Data of Customer Visitors. Accordingly, if you are a
    Customer Visitor, you should check the privacy policy of the website that
    you are visiting and that is being operated by Our Customer. Section 3 (c)
    above describes how we process information on behalf of Our Customers.
</p>
<p>
    If We rely on Our legitimate interests for using Personal Data, We will
    undertake a balancing test to ensure that Our legitimate interests are not
    outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which
    require protection of the Personal Data. You can ask Us for information on
    this balancing test by contacting us at privacy@chartbeat.com.
</p>
<h2>
    5. ONWARD TRANSFER - DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES
</h2>
<p>
    Except as expressly set out in this Privacy Policy, We will not sell, lease
    or exchange the Personal Data relating to: (i) Chartbeat Site Visitors;
    (ii) Our Customers; or (iii) Customer Visitors (to the extent that we
    obtain Personal Data), to third parties without first obtaining express
    consent, unless permitted or required by law.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Traffic Data
</h2>
<p>
    For Customers and Customer Visitors, We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic
    Data with that from Our other Customers to provide benchmarking data and
    other functionality, but we will not disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a
    manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or a Customer Website
    without the Customer's express prior consent.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Agents, vendors and service providers
</h2>
<p>
    For all types of Personal Data (from Chartbeat Site Visitors, Customers and
    Customer Visitors ), We employ other companies and people to perform tasks
    on Our behalf and may need to share Personal Data with them to provide Our
    products and services. Examples include billing, technical assistance, and
    customer service. Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy
    protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Chartbeat's agents do
    not have any right to use the Personal Data we share with them beyond what
    is necessary to assist us. Any agent that we share your Personal Data with
    must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the Personal
    Data that are no less protective than those set out in this policy.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Business Transfers
</h2>
<p>
    Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
    information about Customers as well as aggregated and anonymized data is
    typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if
    Chartbeat, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user
    information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or
    acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur,
    and that any acquirer of Chartbeat may continue to use your Personal Data
    as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>
    d. Public authorities and compliance with law
</h2>
<p>
    Chartbeat may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to a lawful
    request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law
    enforcement requirements, prevent illegal activity, or comply with any
    legal obligation.
</p>
<h2>
    e. Enforce Our Terms of Use and agreements
</h2>
<p>
    We may disclose your Personal Data to third parties in order to enforce or
    apply Our Terms of Service, or any other agreement or to respond to any
    claims, to protect Our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect
    the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity.
</p>
<h2>
    f. Protect rights and property
</h2>
<p>
    We may disclose your Personal Data to protect the rights, property, or
    safety of Chartbeat, Our staff, Our Customers or other persons. This may
    include exchanging Personal Data with other organizations for the purposes
    of fraud protection.
</p>
<p>
    In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss
    individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield,
    Chartbeat remains potentially liable if third party processing Personal
    Data received from the European Union or Switzerland on its behalf
    processes that Personal Data in a manner which is inconsistent with the
    Privacy Shield Principles (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not
    responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).
</p>
<h2>
    6. HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
</h2>
<p>
    We keep your Personal Data for no longer than necessary for the purposes
    for which the Personal Data is processed. The length of time for which We
    retain Personal Data depends on the purposes for which We collect and use
    it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish,
    exercise or defend Our legal rights.
</p>
<p>
    Except as required by applicable laws or in order to defend any actual or
    possible legal claims, We will take reasonable steps to return or
    irretrievably delete all personal data processed on behalf of Our Customers
    when it is no longer required to exercise or perform Our rights or
    obligations under Our Terms of Service, and in any event within 90 days of
    expiry or termination of Our Terms of Service.
</p>
<h2>
    7. CHOICE, ACCESS AND YOUR RIGHTS
</h2>
<h2>
    a. Your Authorization Required
</h2>
<p>
    Whether you are a Chartbeat Site Visitor, a Customer or a Customer Visitor,
    We will not use or share your Personal Data other than as set forth in this
    Privacy Policy, or as you have explicitly authorized, without obtaining
    your consent.
</p>
<p>
    If at any time We would like to disclose your Personal Data to a third
    party in a manner not described above, We will provide you with an
    affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice. To limit the use and disclosure of
    your Personal Data, you may also submit a written opt-out request to
    privacy@chartbeat.com. Customer Visitors specifically have the right to opt
    out of data tracking by visiting https://static.chartbeat.com/opt-out.html
</p>
<h2>
    b. Email Opt-Out.
</h2>
<p>

<h2>
    8. COOKIES
</h2>
<p>
    Like many other websites, We use a standard technology called "cookies."
</p>
<p>
    Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive. They can
    help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient.
</p>
<h2>
    a. Our site
</h2>
<p>
    As set forth above, we may use cookies in connection with third party
    services to run analytics on Our Site.
</p>
<h2>
    b. Customers
</h2>
<p>
    Cookies allow Customers to login without entering their user ID and
    password each time they use the Service.
</p>
<h2>
    c. Customers' websites
</h2>
<p>
    We also use cookies on Customer Websites; these cookies help Us understand
    how Customer Visitors interact with those Customer Websites. Cookies also
    allow Us to improve the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If a Customer does not allow the placement of Chartbeat cookies on its
    Customer Website, the "new vs. returning user" data point in its Chartbeat
    dashboard will not be accurately reported. If you choose to remove
    Chartbeat cookies, please refer to the documentation for your browser.
</p>
<h2>
    d. Disabling cookies
</h2>
<p>
    Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will
    prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on
    the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on
    acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If a Customer disables
    cookies, it will not be able to use the data tracking capabilities of the
    Service.
</p>
<h2>
    e. For Our European Customers where the EU ePrivacy Directive applies:
</h2>
<p>
    Chartbeat uses several cookies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>_cb: </strong>
        This cookie stores a visitor's unique identifier (relative to your
        specific site) for Chartbeat tracking on your site. This cookie has a
        395 day duration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>_chartbeat2: </strong>
        This cookie stores timing information about when this visitor has
        visited your site before. This enables us to distinguish between new,
        returning, and loyal visitors. This cookie has a 395 day duration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>_cb_svref</strong>
        <strong>:</strong>
        This cookie stores the original referrer for this site visitor -- for
        example, this will store the fact that a visitor arrived to your site
        via Twitter, past the first page view, so that when a visitor
        recirculates to a different article page, we still know that they
        originally arrived on your site via Twitter. This cookie expires after
        30 minutes but the timer is reset if a visitor visits a new page on
        your site before the cookie expires. This cookie has a 30 minute
        duration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>_chartbeat4</strong>
        <strong>:</strong>
        This is a short-lived cookie that carries leftover engagement data from
        one page to the next, to make sure that we can send it to our servers
        successfully from the next page. This ensures that we capture as much
        engagement data as possible. This cookie has a 1 minute duration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>_chartbeat5</strong>
        <strong>:</strong>
        This is a short-lived cookie that carries click information from one
        page to the next. This enables us to track which links on a page were
        clicked on to display to editors in real-time. This cookie has a 1
        minute duration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>_v__chartbeat3</strong>
        <strong>:</strong>
        This is used by our video tracking system. It is a video-specific
        visitor identifier. This cookie has a 1 minute duration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>_v__cb_cp:</strong>
        This is used by our video tracking system. It briefly stores leftover
        data from a previous video view session as a visitor navigates from one
        page to the next. This cookie has a 1 hour duration.
    </li>
</ul>

    Personal Data. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before
    disclosing your Personal Data to third parties.

    ads to Chartbeat Visitors and Customers.
</p>
<h2>
    11. VOLUNTARY PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA
</h2>
<p>
    Please be aware that whenever one voluntarily discloses Personal Data
    online - e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through

    with this Privacy Policy. Each of Our employees and agents are aware of Our
    security policies; Personal Data is only available to those employees and
    agents who need it to perform their jobs.
