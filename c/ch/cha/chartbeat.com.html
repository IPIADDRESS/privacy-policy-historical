"Terms of Service" as used herein shall refer to Our online terms of use as well as the terms of any master service agreement or other agreement governing use of the Service. Customers agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and to have read and understood this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms used here and defined in the Terms of Service shall have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Service. Any order forms or additional agreements to which Customers agree governing the provision of optional Chartbeat features shall take precedence over the terms of this Privacy Policy to the extent of any differences, so please read such order forms or additional agreements carefully.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses activities on Our Site and Service.</p>

          <li>
            <h2 id="notification-of-changes">NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h2>

            <p>If We change this Privacy Policy and seek to use personal information which has already been collected and stored by Us in a manner which is different from that stated at the time of collection, We will either notify the relevant website visitors and/or Customers via e-mail or otherwise in some manner through the Site or Service.</p>

            <p>If We make any material changes in Our privacy practices that do not affect personal information already collected and stored by Us, We will post a notice on Our Site notifying users and/or Customers of the change.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2 id="what-information-we-collect-and-how-we-use-it">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT.</h2>

            <p>We use the information We collect from Chartbeat Site Visitors , Chartbeat Customers, and Customer Visitors to create a secure and personalized service.</p>

            <p>a. <u>Chartbeat Site Visitors (which includes Customers who visit the Site)</u></p>
            <p>For Chartbeat Site Visitors, We collect and store Site use data, such as IP address and browser type, and We use analytics services which set and collect cookie IDs for purposes of understanding Chartbeat Site Visitors' loyalty to the Site. We use the IP addresses to assist in login and other uses related to use of the Service. Chartbeat Site Visitors sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends.</p>
            <p>We may also collect user ID and password information to enable returning Chartbeat Site Visitors to log into the Site.</p>
            <p>Finally, Chartbeat Site Visitors may provide personal information to us in order to download marketing materials, or in order to opt-in to receive marketing emails. Chartbeat Site Visitors can opt-out of marketing emails at any time by utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein.</p>

            <p>b. <u>Customers (those who use the Chartbeat Product)</u></p>
            <p>For Customers specifically, We collect and store personal information that Our Customers submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses and billing information, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service.</p>
            <p>If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer’s phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.</p>
            <p>We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers’ use of the Service. Customers’ sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Customer's account.</p>
            <p>We also collect Customers’ user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.</p>
            <p>Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers can opt-out of marketing emails by utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein, but We may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts.</p>

            <p>c. <u>Customer Visitors  (individuals who visit publisher ‘s websites)</u></p>
            <p>For Customer Visitors, when a Customer Visitor visits a Customer Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type on behalf of our Customer. Their session on the Customer Website will be tracked. We may use their IP address to identify the general geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website. We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses or link IP addresses to any personal information. We also use this information for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends in connection with Our provision of the Service.</p>
            <p>As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose to activate the Service. In connection with the collection of this Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any personal information from Customer Visitors, (i) so long as the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Us, so that URLs containing personal information of Customer Visitors are not captured by the Service, and (ii) provided that We do collect IP addresses from Customer Visitors in order to show geolocation information but We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses in a manner that would permit personal identification.</p>
            <p>Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and uptime monitoring. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but We will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior consent.</p>
            <p>We also collect first party cookie IDs on behalf of Customers.   Chartbeat code, by default, sets and reads a cookie on the Customer's website domain containing a randomly-generated user ID for purposes of determining unique visitor counts and visitors' loyalty to a site.  Such information can be classified as personal information under the European General Data Protection Regulation but it is not stored in a manner that would permit personal identification.</p>
            <p>We also collect and use browser header information to help Us understand from which websites a Customer Visitor navigates to a Customer Website.</p>
            <p>Our Customers are required to: (a) make appropriate disclosures using the Customer's privacy policy or via statements on the Customer's website(s); and (b) obtain all Customer Visitors' consent to the use of cookies, if applicable, as required by law. Chartbeat is not and shall not be liable for any collection or use of personal information of Customer Visitors due to a Customer’s placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website not in accordance with Chartbeat’s instructions or documentation.</p>

            <br>
            <p><u>c. Customer Website Visitors</u></p>
            <p>We are processors of information about Customer Visitors and therefore are not strictly required to provide information about the legal basis on which We use personal information of Customer Visitors.  Accordingly, if you are a Customer Visitor, you should check the privacy policy of the website that you are visiting and that is being operated by Our Customer.  Section 3 (c) above describes how we process information on behalf of Our Customers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If We rely on Our legitimate interests for using personal information, We will undertake a balancing test to ensure that Our legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.  You can ask Us for information on this balancing test by contacting us at privacy@chartbeat.com.</p>

          <li>
            <h2 id="onward-transfer">ONWARD TRANSFER - DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
            <p>Except as expressly set out in this Privacy Policy, We will not sell, lease or exchange the personal information relating to: (i) Chartbeat Site Visitors; (ii) Our Customers; or (iii) Customer Visitors (to the extent that we obtain personal information), to third parties without first obtaining express consent, unless permitted or required by law.</p>
            <p>a. <u>Traffic Data</u></p>
            <p>For Customers and Customer Visitors, We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from Our other Customers to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but we will not disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or a Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior consent.</p>
            <br>

            <p>b. <u>Agents, vendors and service providers </u></p>
            <p>For all types of personal information (from Chartbeat Site Visitors, Customers and Customer Visitors ), We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on Our behalf and may need to share personal information with them to provide Our products and services. Examples include billing, technical assistance, and customer service. Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Chartbeat’s agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Any agent that we share your personal information with must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the personal information that are no less protective than those set out in this policy.</p>
            <br>

            <p>c. <u>Business Transfers</u></p>
            <p>Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, information about Customers as well as aggregated and anonymized data is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Chartbeat, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Chartbeat may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <br>

            <p>d. <u>Public authorities and compliance with law </u></p>
            <p>Chartbeat may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, prevent illegal activity, or comply with any legal obligation. </p>
            <br>

            <p>e. <u>Enforce Our Terms of Use and agreements</u></p>
            <p><u>We may disclose your personal information to third parties in order to enforce or apply Our Terms of Service,</u>or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect Our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity.</p>
            <br>

            <p>f. <u>Protect rights and property</u></p>
            <p>We may disclose your personal information to protect the rights, property, or safety of Chartbeat, Our staff, Our Customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal information with other organizations for the purposes of fraud protection.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Chartbeat remains potentially liable if third party processing personal information received from the European Union or Switzerland on its behalf processes that personal information in a manner which is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).</p>

            <p>h. <u>Right data portability</u></p>
            <p>You have a right to ask Us to provide your personal information to a third party provider of services.</p>
            <p>This right only applies where We use your personal information on the basis of your consent or performance of a contract; and where Our use of your information is carried out by automated means.</p>
            <br>

            <p>i. <u>Right to object</u></p>

            <h2 id="cookies">COOKIES</h2>
            <p>Like many other websites, We use a standard technology called "cookies."</p>
            <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient.</p>
            <br>

            <p>a. <u>Our site</u></p>
            <p>As set forth above, we may use cookies in connection with third party services to run analytics on Our Site.</p>
            <br>

            <p>b. <u>Customers</u></p>
            <p>Cookies allow Customers to login without entering their user ID and password each time they use the Service.</p>
            <br>

            <p>c. <u>Customers' websites</u></p>
            <p>We also use cookies on Customer Websites; these cookies help Us understand how Customer Visitors interact with those Customer Websites. Cookies also allow Us to improve the Service.</p>
            <p>If a Customer does not allow the placement of Chartbeat cookies on its Customer Website, the “new vs. returning user” data point in its Chartbeat dashboard will not be accurately reported. If you choose to remove Chartbeat cookies, please refer to the documentation for your browser.</p>
            <br>

            <p>d. <u>Disabling cookies</u></p>
            <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If a Customer disables cookies, it will not be able to use the data tracking capabilities of the Service.</p>
            <br>

            <p>e. <u><b>For Our European Customers where the EU ePrivacy Directive applies:</b> </u></p>
            <p>Chartbeat uses two cookies. One cookie (_chartbeat2) is used to register whether a Customer Visitor  has visited the Customer Website before (to calculate “new vs returning” users). The other (_SUPERFLY_nosample) is used only if a Customer exceeds its plan’s traffic limit. When the traffic limit is reached the cookie is set and will disable the beacon from that Customer for one hour. The chartbeat2 cookie will remain valid as to any given website visitor, until the visitor elects to disable it. The SUPERFLY_nosample cookie is valid for one hour.</p>
