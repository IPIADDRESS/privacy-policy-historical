<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

Effective October 1, 2008<br><br>

  This privacy policy
  describes how we collect and use your data. Betaworks, LLC. owns and operates
  CHARTBEAT.COM. If you have any questions or comments regarding CHARTBEAT.COM's
  privacy policy or its enforcement, please contact us at legal [AT SIGN]
  betaworks.com.
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</b> CHARTBEAT.COM collects information our users submit to us such as
      their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify
      them of changes or updates to our service. CHARTBEAT.COM also collects information 
      from users that is unique, but
      cannot be linked to a specific individual, such as IP address and browser
      type. A user's session will be tracked, but each user will remain
      anonymous. We gather this information for systems administration purposes
      and to track user trends. We do not link IP addresses to any personally
      identifiable information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>COOKIES.</b> Like many
      other Web sites, CHARTBEAT.COM uses a standard technology called "cookies."
      Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive -- not
      on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more
      convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and
      password each time they use CHARTBEAT.COM. Cookies help us understand how
      members use CHARTBEAT.COM, which allows us to improve upon the service.
      Members who
      disable cookies will not be able to use CHARTBEAT.COM.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b> CHARTBEAT.COM uses personal information to create a
      secure and personalized service for our members. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b> We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal
      data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless
      required by law or to protect your membership.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES.</b> The CHARTBEAT.COM site may contain links to other Web sites.
      Please be aware that CHARTBEAT.COM is not responsible for the privacy
      practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide
      any information directly to parties other than CHARTBEAT.COM, different
      rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information
      disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before
      disclosing your personal information to third parties.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS.</b> CHARTBEAT.COM may choose to deploy advertising on the service
      that is delivered to users through a third party's advertising server.
      Information about users' visits to CHARTBEAT.COM, such as number of times
      they have viewed an ad (but no personally identifiable information), would
      be used to serve ads to users on this
      site.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS, AND PUBLIC FORUMS.</b> Please be aware that whenever members
      voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards,
      chat areas, file uploads, events, and listings - that information becomes
      public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal
      information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited
      messages from other parties.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN.</b> In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
      Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly provide access to CHARTBEAT.COM to
      persons under the age of thirteen (13). If CHARTBEAT.COM later learns that
      any member is under the age of thirteen (13), we will take appropriate
      steps to remove the member's information from the database and we will
      restrict this individual from future access to the CHARTBEAT.COM
      service.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>UPDATING AND DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b> Users who leave the service may choose to have their
      personal information deleted by contacting legal [AT SIGN] betaworks.com.
      
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>OPT-OUT OF EMAIL.</b>
      Users of CHARTBEAT.COM may choose not to receive email notifications at
      their registered email addresses. To opt out of the announcements, follow the instructions at the
      bottom of the e-mail.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>SECURITY PROCEDURES.</b>
      CHARTBEAT.COM has implemented security measures to protect member
      information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard
      practices such as encrypted storage, firewalls and password protection
      systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information.
      Each of our employees is aware of our security policies, and your
      information is only available to those employees who need it to perform
      their jobs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>CONSENT.</b> This Privacy
      Policy is a part of the CHARTBEAT.COM Terms of Use policy. By using
      CHARTBEAT.COM, users are using a service provided by CHARTBEAT.COM and they
      agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Some terms
      may be defined in the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy only addresses
      activities from our servers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.</b> If CHARTBEAT.COM changes its policy and seeks to use your
      personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated
      at the time of collection, you will be notified via e-mail. In addition,
      if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not
      affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a
      notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where
      we post the notice, we will also e-mail users who have opted to receive
      communications from us to notify them of the changes in our privacy
      practices.
