        <p><strong>Effective Date: April 14, 2017</strong></p>

        <p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes how Chartbeat, Inc. ("Chartbeat", "We" or "Us") collects and uses personal information relating to: (i) users of our websites, including chartbeat.com (collectively, the “Site”); (ii) registered users of the Chartbeat service ("Customers"); and (iii) end-users of our Customers' websites on which the Chartbeat service is implemented ("Customer Websites"). Certain sections of this Privacy Policy are only relevant if you are a user of our Site; others are only relevant if you are a Customer, or an end-user of Customer Websites.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or comments regarding this privacy policy or its enforcement, please contact Us at <a href="mailto:privacy@chartbeat.com">privacy@chartbeat.com</a>.</p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <h2>CONSENT</h2>

            <p>By visiting the Site and using the Chartbeat service (the "Service"), you agree to our use and processing of your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>If you are a Customer using the Service, this Privacy Policy is a part of Our Terms of Service. "Terms of Service" as used herein shall refer to Our online terms of use as well as the terms of any master service agreement or other agreement governing your use of the Service. You agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms used here and defined in the Terms of Service shall have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Service. Any order forms or additional agreements to which you agree governing the provision of optional Chartbeat features shall take precedence over the terms of this Privacy Policy to the extent of any differences, so please read such order forms or additional agreements carefully.</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses activities on our Site and Service.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h2>

            <p>If We change this Privacy Policy and seek to use personal information which has already been collected and stored by Us in a manner which is different from that stated at the time of collection, We will either notify the relevant users and/or Customers via e-mail or otherwise in some manner through the Site or Service.</p>

            <p>If We make any material changes in Our privacy practices that do not affect personal information already collected and stored by Us, We will post a notice on Our Site notifying users and/or Customers of the change.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>NOTICE AND DATA INTEGRITY – WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT.</h2>

            <p>We generally use the information We collect from users of Our Site, Customers of our Service, and end users of Our Customer Websites to create a secure and personalized service.</p>

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <u>Users of our Site</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For users of our Site, We collect and store account information, such as user email addresses, names, billing information, as well as Site use data, which includes how users interact with Our Website. We use that data to allow Us to identify users, administer the Service, make product decisions and notify users of changes or updates to the Site.</p>

                <p>If a users decides to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer’s phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.</p>

                <p>We also collect other information from users, such as IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses to assist in login and other uses related to use of the Service. User's sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a user's account.</p>

                <p>We also collect user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.</p>

                <p>Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers can opt-out of marketing emails by adjusting their account settings, but we may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <u>Customers</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For Customers specifically, We collect and store personal information that our Customers submit to Us, such as their names and e-mail addresses, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service.</p>

                <p>If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer’s phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.</p>

                <p>We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and browser type. We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers’ use of the Service. Customers’ sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends. We may link IP address and other information to a Customer's account.</p>

                <p>We also collect Customers’ user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.</p>

                <p>Finally, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers can opt-out of marketing emails by adjusting their account settings, but we may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <u>Users of Customer Websites</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For end users of Customer Websites, when an end user visits a Customer Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type. Their session on the Customer Website will be tracked, but each user will remain anonymous. We may use their IP address to identify the general geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information. We also use this information for systems administration purposes, abuse prevention and to track user trends.</p>

                <p>As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose to activate the Service. In connection with the collection of this Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any personal information from users of Customer Websites, provided that (i) Chartbeat does collect IP addresses from visitors to Customer Websites in order to show geolocation information, and (ii) the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Chartbeat, so that URLs containing personal information of end users are not captured by the Service.</p>

                <p>Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and uptime monitoring. We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but Chartbeat will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior consent.</p>

                <p>We also collect and use browser header information to help Us understand from which websites a user navigates to a Customer Website.</p>

                <p>Chartbeat is not and shall not be liable for any collection or use of personal information of end users of a Customer Website due to a Customer’s placement of the Chartbeat code on the Customer website not in accordance with Chartbeat’s instructions or the documentation.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>


          <li>
            <h2>ONWARD TRANSFER - DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.</h2>

            <p>Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, we will not sell, lease or exchange the personal information relating to: (i) users of our Site; (ii) our Customers; or (iii) any end user of our Customers' websites (to the extent that we obtain personal information), to third parties without first obtaining their express consent, unless required by law.</p>

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                  <u>Traffic Data</u>
                  <p>For Customers and end users of Customer Websites, We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from our other Customers to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but we will not disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or a Customer Website without the Customer’s express prior consent.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <u>Agents</u>
                  <p>For all types of personal information (from users of our Site, Customers and end users of Customer Websites), We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share personal information with them to provide our products and services. Examples include billing, technical assistance, and customer service. Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, Chartbeat’s agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Any agent that we share your personal information with must agree, via contract, to provide adequate protections for the personal information that are no less protective than those set out in this policy.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <u>Business Transfers</u>
                  <p>In some cases, Chartbeat may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, information about Customers as well as aggregated and anonymized data is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Chartbeat, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Chartbeat may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <u>Public authorities</u>
                  <p>In some cases, Chartbeat may be required to disclose personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Chartbeat remains potentially liable if third party processing personal information received from the European Union or Switzerland on its behalf processes that personal information in a manner which is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles (unless Chartbeat can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>CHOICE.</h2>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <u>Your Authorization Required</u>
                <p>Whether you are a user of our Site, a Customer or an end user of a Customer Website, We will not use or share your personal information other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as you have explicitly authorized, without obtaining your consent.</p>

                <p>If at any time We would like to disclose your personal information to a third party in a manner not described above, We will provide you with an affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice. To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, you may also submit a written opt-out request to <a href="mailto:privacy@chartbeat.com">privacy@chartbeat.com</a>.</p>

                <p>Except as set out above and below specifically in relation to our Customers, personal information will not be used to directly market the Service unless that possible use of the information has been disclosed to you and you have authorized us to permit such disclosure.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Email Opt-Out.</u>
                <p>As noted above in relation to our Customers specifically, Customers are automatically opted-in to receive marketing emails from us when they register for the Service. Customers may choose not to receive marketing emails from Us and can opt out of such e-mails through their account settings.</p>
              </li>

                <u>Accessing Personal Information.</u>
                <p>Users of the Site, Chartbeat's Customers and end users of our Customers' Websites, may request access to personal information which is collected and used by Chartbeat in accordance with this Privacy Policy, so that they can correct it.</p>

                <p>Note that We do not retain IP addresses, browser information or header information relating to users of our Customers' Websites for more than a temporary period of time in order to provide the Service, and as such, that information cannot be accessed or modified once deleted.</p>

                <p>Chartbeat acknowledges that EU and Swiss individuals have the right to access the personal information/data that we maintain about them. An EU or Swiss individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his query to privacy@chartbeat.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

                <u>Deletion - Customers only.</u>

                <b>For our European Customers where the EU ePrivacy Directive applies:</b>
                <p>Chartbeat uses two cookies. One cookie (_chartbeat2) is used to register whether a user has visited the Customer Website before (to calculate “new vs returning” users). The other (_SUPERFLY_nosample) is used only if a Customer exceeds its plan’s traffic limit. When the traffic limit is reached the cookie is set and will disable the beacon from that Customer for one hour. The chartbeat2 cookie will remain valid as to any given website visitor or user, until the user elects to disable it. The SUPERFLY_nosample cookie is valid for one hour.</p>
