      <h3>Effective Date: May 15, 2018</h3>

<p>ChargePoint® has created this privacy policy to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy of its customers and users. This privacy policy applies to this website, including the portion of the website accessed by ChargePoint customers and users (collectively, the "Web Site"), and the service offered by ChargePoint, including through use of the ChargePoint Smart Cards (the "Service"). By using this Web Site and the Service or by transmitting information to us by email or other electronic means, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>

<h3>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We may change and update this privacy policy from time to time, so you should check back to this page for the updated policy. For any significant changes affecting your personally identifiable information, we will post a more prominent notice to the Web Site of the change. If you disagree with any change, you must stop using the Service.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we will consider your continued use to be acceptance of the change.</p>

<h3>2. Information Collection and Usage</h3>

<p>ChargePoint collects different kinds of information through the Web Site and the Service, and uses this information in different ways.</p>

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit the Web Site we collect certain demographic information (such as your IP address, type of Internet browser and operating system you use, pages viewed, the URL that you visited before you came to&nbsp;our Web Site, and the URL to which you next go) in order to understand how users navigate through the Web Site and to improve your experience using the Web Site.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information. If you sign up for the Service or use the Service or&nbsp;send email or other communication to ChargePoint, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Web Site and Service. In registering for the Service, we need to get some information from you (like name, title, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card or other means of payment, etc.). When using the Service, you may be asked for additional information to help identify you. All of this information used to specifically identify you is called "User Information" in this privacy policy. We only collect User Information that you provide to us or have given us permission to collect.</p>

<p>When you use our Service, we collect certain demographic information (such as your ChargePoint charging station location and charging duration) in order to understand usage patterns and to improve your experience using our Service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We use the User Information in order to process the application, to provide the Service to the customer and users and to otherwise communicate with you as a customer or user regarding the Service. Please keep in mind that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of the Service, such as service announcements, notices about new features or information on the Service, administrative messages and communications regarding your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also may use the User Information to provide advertisements from ChargePoint or its partners to you, but you will have the opportunity to opt-out of these communications.</p>

<p>From time to time, you may receive offers through ChargePoint from other businesses. These offers may require you to provide information to them if you choose to accept their offers. You should remember that these offers are made by the businesses themselves and not by ChargePoint. You should always be sure to read the terms of service and privacy policies of these businesses before providing any information to them so that you can understand their intended uses for your information. ChargePoint may receive information from these regarding your response to their offers so that ChargePoint may better tailor your user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From time to time, we may also collect information via online surveys or polls. Participation in these surveys or polls is entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aggregated Information. ChargePoint may also analyze and compile information on patterns of usage of the Service. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. We may use this information to improve the Service and provide this information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Cookies. Please refer to our “Cookies and other similar technologies” policy for information on how we use cookies and similar technologies. Like most websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to provide users an efficient experience in using the Website as well as certain web analytics tools for the purpose of analysing your use of the Website and the Service, compiling reports on the Website and the Service activity for ChargePoint and providing ChargePoint other services relating to activity on the Website and the Service. So we do recommend that you read and understand that policy as well.</p>

<ul>

	<li>(b) to our service providers and other contractors for the purposes of providing Service to us (such contractors are prohibited from using User Information for any other purpose),</li>
	<li>(c) for bill collection;</li>
	<li>(d) to resolve customer disputes or inquiries;</li>
	<li>(e) to a Program Partner (as defined herein) (but only if you are participating in an offer or program offered by ChargePoint in conjunction with one of its partners (each, a "Program Partner")), in order for ChargePoint and the Program Partner to provide the Service, confirm that you are eligible to participate in such offer or program (e.g., by sharing and verifying the VIN of your vehicle), and for the Program Partner to understand your usage patterns and to improve its offer or program with ChargePoint or other offers, programs or services offered by the Program Partner;</li>
	<li>(f) in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of ChargePoint’s business assets; and</li>
	<li>(g) where we are legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties for the purposes of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance.</li>
</ul>
