      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#666600">DoubleClick 
        Privacy Statement</font></p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Internet user privacy 
      is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, our advertisers and our Web publishers. 
      The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust 
      of our users. Below is information regarding DoubleClick's commitment to 
      protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet. 
      </font> 
      <p> 
      </p><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#666600">User 
        Information</font></h3>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All users who receive 
      an ad targeted by DoubleClick's technology remain completely anonymous to 
      DoubleClick. In the course of delivering an ad to you, DoubleClick does 
      not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your 
      name, address, phone number or email address. DoubleClick does, however, 
      collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such 
      as the server your computer is logged onto or your browser type (for example, 
      Netscape or Internet Explorer). The information collected by DoubleClick 
      is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness 
      on behalf of DoubleClick's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically 
      request it. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To enable DoubleClick 
        to compile meaningful reports for its client Web sites and advertisers 
        and to better target advertising to you, DoubleClick collects the following 
        types of non-personally-identifiable information about users who are served 
        ads via DoubleClick technology: </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Your IP address (a 
        unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet). Information 
        which DoubleClick can infer from the IP address includes the user's geographic 
        location, company, and type and size of organization. Your domain type 
        (i.e., .com, .net, or .edu.). </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Standard information 
        included with every communication sent on the Internet. Information which 
        DoubleClick can infer from this standard information includes your browser 
        version and type (i.e., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system 
        (i.e., windows or DOS), browser language (i.e., Java or Unix), service 
        provider (i.e., MindSpring or AOL), your local time, etc. Clickstream 
        information (i.e., DoubleClick can measure how you utilize the pages you 
        visit within a site). </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On occasion, affiliated 
        advertisers or Web publishers may provide DoubleClick with anonymous demographic 
        information so that you may receive ads that more closely match your interests. 
        This information is afforded the same stringent privacy protections as 
        the DoubleClick-generated non-personally-identifiable data. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DoubleClick believes 
        that its limited use of the non-personally-identifiable data benefits 
        you because it enhances the functionality and effectiveness of the advertisements 
        you view which are delivered through the DoubleClick technology. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are some cases 
        when a user voluntarily provides personal information in response to an 
        ad (a survey or purchase form, for example). In these situations, DoubleClick 
        (or a third party engaged by DoubleClick) collects the information on 
        behalf of the advertiser and/or Web site. This information is used by 
        the advertiser and/or Web site so that you can receive the goods, services 
        or information that you requested. Where indicated in some requests, DoubleClick 
        may use this information in aggregate form to get a more precise profile 
        of the type of individuals viewing ads or visiting the Web sites. </font>
      </p><p> 
      </p><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#666600">Cookies 
        and Opt Out</font></h3>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DoubleClick, along with 
      thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience. 
      DoubleClick's cookies cannot be used to determine any personally-identifiable 
      information about you and do not damage your system or files in any way. 
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here's how it works. 
        When you are first served an ad by DoubleClick, DoubleClick assigns you 
        a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. 
        Then, when you visit a Web site on which DoubleClick serves ads, DoubleClick 
        reads this number to help target ads to you. The cookie can help ensure 
        that you do not see the same ad over and over again. Cookies can also 
        help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site. This information 
        helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While we believe 
        that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness 
        of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, 
        they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web 
        advertising. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you do not want 
        the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to 
        deny or accept this feature. To find out more about this procedure, please 
        click here. </font>
      </p><p> 
      </p><h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#666600">Accepting/Declining 
        Cookies</font></h3>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To eliminate cookies 
      you may have currently accepted, and to deny cookies in the future, please 
      follow this procedure: </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you are using 
        Netscape Navigator 3.0, go to the Options Menu, to Network Preferences 
        and then to Protocols. Check the box that says "Show an alert before accepting 
        a cookie." Then go into your Netscape folder (usually c:\program files\netspace\navigator) 
        and delete the file which is called "cookies.txt." Under Windows 95, you 
        could also use the Find feature on the start menu to simply find the file 
        called Cookies.txt. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In Internet Explorer 
        3.0, go to the View menu, then to Options, then to Advanced. Check the 
        box that says "Warn before accepting cookies." Then go into your cookies 
        directory (usually c:\windows\cookies) and delete all the files you have 
        there. Once you delete these files, you will have no more cookies, and 
        you will be prompted each time a Web site attempts to send a cookie to 
        your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel the 
        cookie. </font>
      </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you are using 
        Netscape 4.0+, go to "Edit" in the menu bar, click on "Preferences", click 
        on "Advanced", and check the box that says "Warn me before accepting a 
        cookie". Now go to your "Start" button, click on "Find", click on "Files 
        and Folders", type "cookies.txt" into the search box that appears, and 
        click "Find Now". When the search results appear, drag all files listed, 
        into the "Recycle Bin". Now shut down and restart your Netscape. </font>
      </p><p>
