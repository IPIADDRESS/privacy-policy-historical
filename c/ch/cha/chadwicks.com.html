		<div class="privacyCenterText">
			We use cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on our websites. Cookies are small files or records that we place on your computers' hard drive to collect information about your activities on the sites. There are absolutely no personally identifiable pieces of information stored anywhere in these files, and they are used solely by Chadwicks and metrostyle to enhance your shopping experience and to allow us to serve you better in the future. These cookies transmit information back to the computers at Chadwicks and metrostyle; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the sites; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of some of our marketing e-mail campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of visitors served.<br>
			<br>
			Most people do not even know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Chadwicks.com and metrostyle.com sites or most other websites because web browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie acceptance altogether. However, if you refuse cookies, you will be unable to order from the Chadwicks.com and metrostyle.com sites using the Shopping Cart. You will still be able to browse our selection, but the order process requires that your Web Browser be set to allow cookies. Moreover, by not allowing cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience could be adversely affected.</div>
