        systems such as "Web beacons," which monitor your use of our Web sites. 
        Tracking systems (Web beacons or Web bugs) are small strings of code that

        of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, 
        the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon 
        appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types 
        of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of 
        any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding 
        with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you 
        received and opened our e-mail. <br>
