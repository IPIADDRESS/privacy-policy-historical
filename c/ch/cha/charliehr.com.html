Unless you or your Users adjust your/their browser settings to refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you/they log on to our Website.</p>
<p>WHERE WE STORE PERSONAL DATA ABOUT YOU</p>
<p>The information we obtain from you and your Users (including, without limitation, Client Data) may be moved to and stored at a destination within the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"). Staff members operating within the EEA who work for or on behalf of us may process this information. Such staff members may, among other things, be involved in the processing of payment details, the provision of support services and the delivery of your and your Users’ request(s) for us to provide services. When submitting your and your Users’ personal data, you are agreeing to such processing, transfer or storage as outlined above. We will ensure at all times to take all reasonable steps necessary to maintain the security of your data in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that the information we obtain from you and your Users (including, without limitation, Client Data) may be processed by our service providers based in, countries outside of the EEA for the purposes of providing you with the Service. Such countries do not always provide the same level of data protection as the UK; however where such transfers of data occur, we do put in place contracts that include security obligations on our service providers to ensure that your and your Users’ personal data is protected in accordance with UK standards.</p>
<p>We store the data you and your Users provide us with on our secure servers. In the event of us giving you or your Users (or you/they choosing) a password which grants you/them access to specific areas within our Website or Service, it remains your/their responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of this password. This includes the responsibility to refrain from sharing your/their password with other parties.</p>
<p>Because the transmission of data via the Internet cannot be assumed completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any of your or your Users’ data transmitted to our Website or Service; you are therefore responsible for any risk associated with such transmission. We will however at all times take all reasonable steps to ensure the transmission of your and your Users’ data is executed as securely as possible, and upon receipt of your/their data we will continue at all times to enforce strict security procedures and features in an attempt to prevent any unauthorised access.</p>
<p>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>The information we hold about you and your Users may be used in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you and your Users with the Service, including administration and management of your account</li>
<li>To allow you to upload, store and access Client Data</li>
<li>To enable Users to access certain aspects of Charlie and limited Client Data pertinent to themselves</li>
<li>To provide you and Users with user support</li>
<li>To moderate your account</li>
<li>For research and analytics purposes (for example, to improve the quality of the Service)</li>
<li>To ensure security for you, the Users, our staff and other users of the Service</li>
<li>To comply with applicable Laws, court orders, government and law enforcement agencies’ requests</li>
<li>To provide you and Users with online personalised services and targeted advertising</li>
<li>To send you further information about our services for which we think you may have an interest. This information will be supplied only where you have given consent</li>
<li>To send you further information about our services based on a request we have received from you</li>
<li>To fulfil the obligations we have in relation to any contracts we have in place with you (including, without limitation, the EULA)</li>
<li>To provide you with notification about any changes to our services</li>
</ul>
<p>We will never supply your data to third parties unless under the conditions stated beneath this section of our policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may aggregate and anonymise personal data (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, sensitive personal data) and use and share such aggregated and anonymised personal data with third parties for statistical purposes and for the purpose of data analytics, product development, service improvement.</p>
<p>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>Disclosure of your personal data (including, without limitation, Client Data) to third parties will only occur if:</p>
<ul>
<li>We sell or purchase any business or assets. In such case, we may authorise the disclosure of your personal data to prospective sellers or buyers of such business or assets</li>
<li>All or the substantial majority of our assets are sold to a third party. In such case, your personal data may be one of the transferred assets</li>
<li>We are required to disclose your or your Users’ personal data in order to fulfil any legal obligation, to enforce our EULA, or to protect the property, rights or safety of Charlie, users of our services or others. In such case, information may be exchanged with third party companies or organisations in order to prevent fraud or reduce credit risk</li>
</ul>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that we may also disclose personal data (including, without limitation, Client Data) with: (i) our service providers involved in the provision, distribution, delivery and support of the Service, including the storage of any Client Data; (ii) fraud prevention agencies; (iii) law enforcement agencies, regulators, courts and public authorities; and (iv) emergency services.</p>
<p>Our service providers have to follow our express instructions when processing the personal data you or your Users provide and they must comply with appropriate security measures to protect such personal data, and we do not allow them to use this information for their own commercial purposes.</p>
<p>YOUR RIGHTS</p>
<p>You retain the right to request us to refrain from processing your data for the purposes of marketing. To exercise such right, you may reply to any information we send you, detailing your request that we refrain from sending any marketing correspondence, or you can exercise this same right by contacting us electronically via email at hello@charliehr.com. If at any time we intend to use your data for such marketing purposes however, it is standard practice for us to make you aware in advance of collecting such data.</p>
<p>We may at times provide links on our Website to third party websites, including without limitation those owned or managed by our partner networks, affiliates or advertisers. These websites have separate privacy policies, and we therefore cannot accept any responsibility for the content. As such, choosing to follow these links is a choice you make at your own risk, and we advise that you check these websites' individual privacy policies before submitting any personal data.</p>
<p>ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>In accordance with the Act, you retain at all times the right to access any data we hold about you. You may exercise this right by making a request in accordance with the Act, and any such request may carry a £10 fee which will cover the administration costs incurred in providing you with any details of the data we hold about you.</p>
<p>HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL DATA FOR</p>
<p>The periods for which we keep information depend on the purpose for which the information was collected and the use to which it is put. We will not keep personal data for longer than necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.</p>
<p>Some information such as such as the date, time and duration of your activity on Charlie, your and your Users’ phone number and IP address will be held for up to one year, for instance if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations, or is in accordance with industry practice.</p>
<p>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>If at any time we make a change to our privacy policy, we will update this page to reflect such change. Where we feel it appropriate, we will notify you by email, however we recommend you review this page periodically to ensure you remain happy with the latest version.</p>
