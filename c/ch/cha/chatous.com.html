<h1>Chatous Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Chatous.com ("Chatous") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on our website, located at www.chatous.com ("Site"). By using Chatous, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Policy.</p>

<b>1. Information We Collect</b>
<p>Chatous collects two types of data about users: (1) information that you or others voluntarily submit to us (described below under “User-Supplied Information”) and (2) technical data automatically collected from all visitors to Chatous (described below under “Automatically Collected Data”).</p> 

<p>User-Supplied Information: In using Chatous, for example when you register with us, engage in a chat, or if you send us an email, you will provide Chatous with data generally called “personally identifiable” information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving Chatous permission to use and store that information consistent with this policy.</p>

<p>Profile Information: Before starting to chat, you can optionally provide personal information such as age, gender, and a screen name. You can also optionally chose whether your location (based on IP address) is shared on the site. By doing so, you understand and authorize us to use all the information exposed to us pursuant to this Privacy Notice and also understand that this information will be shared with users you engage with on our Site. We will use this information to provide you a better experience when using our Site.</p>

<p>Chat Data: Chat conversations on the site are screened by an automated system for spam and select messages may be read by a human being in order to improve Chatous' anti-spam software or for other quality control purposes.
 </p>

<p>Automatically Collected Data: Chatous automatically logs non-personally identifiable information such as Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique user ID, the content and pages that you access on Chatous and the dates and times that you visit the Site. In addition, if you come to the Site via a link from another site, we may also track the source of that link.</p>

<p>Information Regarding “Cookies”: Like many other websites, Chatous may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. Chatous may use cookies to track user traffic patterns as described above. Chatous may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Chatous. Persistent cookies can be removed. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, however, some features on the Chatous may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Please review your web browser “Help” file to modify your cookie settings.</p>


<b>2. Information From Other Sources</b>
<p>We may collect information about you from other sources, including from partners, and from commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases). The following are examples of information we may collect from other sources:
</p><p>Data you authorize us to access through your use of Facebook Connect. In general, the types and amount of personally identifiable information we collect vary depending on the activity. Chatous endeavors to limit the collection of personally identifiable information to information we believe is minimally necessary to achieve our stated collection purposes.</p>

<b>3. Use of Information</b>
<p>Chatous uses personally identifiable information to establish and enhance our relationship with you.  Chatous may use the information that you provide, or that we collect, to operate, maintain, enhance, and deliver the various features and services found on the Site; as well as to track user-generated content and users to comply as a service provider with the DMCA and other applicable laws. Chatous uses all of the information that we collect from users to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Site works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. Further, Chatous may use automatically collected data to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit Chatous; (b) monitor your participation in various sections of the Chatous; (c) customize our service to you, including by providing you with recommendations and (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. We may use your e-mail address for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Chatous updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security-related notices.</p>

<b>4. Disclosure of Information</b>
<p>Chatous does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside vendors, contractors, or agents who help us manage our business activities. Such entities only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and for no other purpose than to provide us with necessary services. Chatous may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or under the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, U.S. copyright or trademark laws) or respond to a court order, subpoena, judicial or other governmental requirement or warrant in a manner required by the requesting entity. Chatous also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect Chatous from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to Chatous; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Site; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Chatous, our Users, or others. In the event that Chatous is acquired by, merged with, or our assets are transferred to, another entity, such entity may be able to use your personal information under the terms of this Privacy Notice.</p>

<b>5. Children</b>
<p>Chatous does not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides their personal information to Chatous through this website represents that they are 13 years of age or older. If Chatous learns that personally identifiable information of persons under the age of 13 years has been collected on the Site without verifiable parental consent, then Chatous will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>

<b>6. Data Security</b>
<p>Chatous takes reasonable measures to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot, therefore, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Chatous, and you do so at your own risk. Please know that although we make our best efforts to keep your information secure, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<b>7. International Visitors</b>
<p>The Site is hosted in the United States. If you visit Chatous from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from laws of the United States, then please understand that you are transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those jurisdictions to the United States for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Notice. By providing your personally identifiable information to Chatous you consent to that transfer.</p>

<b>8. Third Parties</b>
<p>Except as expressly provided otherwise, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information that Chatous collects from you or that you disclose to us. If you disclose your information to others besides Chatous different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Chatous does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
