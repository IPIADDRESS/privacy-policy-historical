            <h3>Forums, Message Boards, Q&amp;A, Groups, Blogs, Etc.</h3>
            <p>When you post any message to a forum, message board, Q&amp;A, group, blog or any other public forum within the Website where users can post their observations and comments on designated topics, your basic information will be available for all registered users to see. This basic information consists of your username. You should not post any information about you or any other person to a forum, message board, Q&amp;A, group, blogs or other public forums within the Website if you want to keep such information private or you are required by law to do so. Information you post to public forums within the Website is considered public information and may be used by us and third parties. As with any public forum on any website, this information may also appear in third party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN etc. We do not control the information indexed and cached by search engines.</p>
            <h3>Log Data</h3>
            <p>When you visit the Website, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information about your use and your visit to the Website ("Log Data"). The Log Data may include information such as your computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, time and date of your requests, your browser type, what software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Website, access times and dates, your location, mobile network information and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Website and for the Website's technical administration, to improve the CMGG Platform's functionalities and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to the users' needs. We only use pseudonymous data for these purposes, unless personal information is required – e.g. for the prosecution of illegal activities on our Website. In any case, we delete or anonymize personal information after a reasonable time, which shall be no longer than four weeks.</p>
            <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
            <p>Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track the use of the Website. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer and allows CMES to recognize you as a user when you return to the Website using the same computer and web browser. You can control how websites use cookies by configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie controls). If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the Website. Like the information you enter at registration, cookies and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Website.</p>
            <p>One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you have logged in to your account. The next time you visit the CMGG Platform, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as a registered user, so you will not need to log in before using the CMGG Platform.</p>
            <p>Additionally, if you log out of your account you will need to re-enter your password the next time in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. That means that they will no longer collect or store information after you close your web browser.</p>
            <p>In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third parties, please click <a href="#third-parties">here</a>. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Website. CMES does not store personal data in the cookies.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereinafter referred to as "Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", small text files placed on your computer to help websites analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Due to the activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (E.E.A.). Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Data that is anonymized cannot be used to identify anyone and therefore does not require protection under many laws, including under E.U. law. Data that is not anonymized may be subject to protections. Google has confirmed that personal data that  is transferred from the E.E.A. to a country outside the E.E.A. will have adequate safeguards, confirming to E.U. law. On behalf of CMES, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, CMES points out that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) including its processing by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: The current link is http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</p>
            <p>Alternatively to using the browser plugin or in the browser on mobile devices, you may click the following link to prevent the collection by Google Analytics in the future: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">download link</a>. By doing so, a cookie will be placed on your device. In case you delete your cookies, you will have to click the link again.</p>
            <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
            <p>We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to users through our Website. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research companies.</p>
            <p>To deliver these ads properly, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by CMES so the ad networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.</p>
            <p>Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad networks’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website. You can control how websites use web beacons by configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie controls).</p>
            <p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. CMES does not provide personal data to any advertiser or any other third parties.</p>

            <h2 class="header-small">Do You Share My Personal Information?</h2>
            <h3 id="third-parties">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
            <p>CMES takes the privacy of users very seriously. Thus, we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personal data with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties do not retain, share, or store any personal data except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements that limit their use of such information.</p>
