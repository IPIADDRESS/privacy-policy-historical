<p>We at ChallengePost have created this Privacy Policy because we know you
care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy
Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the
ChallengePost website located at <a href="http://www.challengepost.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.challengepost.com</a> and its affiliated
websites (collectively referred to as the “Site”), and how we may use and share
that information. By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices
described in this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.</p>

<p>In this Privacy Policy, the words “we,” ‘us” and “our” refer to
ChallengePost.</p>

<h2>Safe Harbor Certification</h2>

<p>In light of the international nature of our business, ChallengePost complies
with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework
as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and
retention of personal information from European Union member countries and
Switzerland. ChallengePost has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor
Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data
integrity, access, and enforcement. For more information about the Safe Harbor
program, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

<h2>Collected Information and Use</h2>

<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you
will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally
identifiable information to ChallengePost (“Personally Identifiable
Information”). Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, email
address, password, and your location. Personally Identifiable Information will
not be publicly displayed on the Site unless you give us permission to display
specific information (such as your full name). Your password and email address
will never be publicly displayed.</p>

<p>You may enter additional content including your username, biography,
challenge ideas, wishes, photos, profile image, questions, suggestions,
solutions, or other content or submissions (collectively referred to as the
“User Content”). User Content may be viewable by the public. It is your
responsibility to ensure that you do not submit any User Content that you do
not want publicly displayed, and that nothing you submit includes proprietary
information, information that’s illegal to make public, or personal information
about you such as your social security number.<br></p>

<p>We use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide in a manner that
is consistent with this Privacy Policy. For instance, we will use the
Personally Identifiable Information you input during the registration process
to administer access to the Site and to award prizes by ChallengePost or the
creator of the challenge. We also use your Personally Identifiable Information
and other non-personally identifiable information collected through the Site to
help us improve the content and functionality of the Site and to better
understand the users of our Site. In addition, we may use your Personally
Identifiable Information to update you about the Site and the challenges we
power. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such
information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>

<p>ChallengePost, or a third party service provider that does not have access
to your Personally Identifiable Information, may collect statistics about the
behavior of visitors to the Site. Our servers may automatically record
information that your browser sends whenever you visit a ChallengePost website.
These server logs may include information such as the page(s) you visited, your
Internet Protocol address, ChallengePost cookie information, web browser type,
browser language, and the date and time of your request. ChallengePost uses
this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server(s), analyze trends
and administer the Site.</p>

<p>Individual challenges may require you to submit additional&nbsp;information
on the submission form and may include additional terms and&nbsp;conditions
relating to privacy. If there is a conflict between this Privacy&nbsp;Policy
and the terms posted or emailed for, or applicable to, a specific
challenge,&nbsp;the latter terms shall control with respect to that challenge
only.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>Like many websites, we use “cookie” technology to collect additional website
usage data and to improve the Site and our service. A cookie is a small data
file that we may transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies
to collect Personally Identifiable Information. ChallengePost may use both
session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact
with the Site and our service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web
traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the SIte and our service.</p>

<p>You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies, but some ChallengePost
features and services may not function properly if your cookies are
disabled.</p>

<h2>Sharing your Information</h2>

<p>ChallengePost is not in the business of selling your information. We
consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personally
Identifiable Information with certain third parties including those set forth
below:</p>

<h3>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</h3>

<p>ChallengePost, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to
perform certain business-related functions. For example, we may pass your
Personally Identifiable Information to our designated service provider(s) in
order to process payments, send mailings, and maintain databases. When we
employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them
only with the information that they need to perform their specific
function.</p>

<h3>Advertisers</h3>

<p>ChallengePost may aggregate your information with information of other
users, and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for
marketing and promotional purposes. However, ChallengePost will never disclose
your Personally Identifiable Information to advertisers and other third parties
for marketing and promotional purposes without your express consent.</p>

<h3>Challenges, Activities and other Events</h3>

<p>ChallengePost may enter into collaborative relationships with other third
parties on the Site with respect to challenges, activities or events. If you
participate in these challenges, activities or events, you may be asked to
provide Personally Identifiable Information or to answer questions that seek
your personal information. We may transfer your Personally Identifiable
Information to third parties in conjunction with such challenges, activities or
events.</p>

<p>Specifically, if you register for an individual challenge in&nbsp;order to
receive updates and enter a submission, ChallengePost may share your
Personally&nbsp;Identifiable Information with the challenge creator
or&nbsp;relevant Sponsor(s). If&nbsp;you enter a submission to a challenge,
ChallengePost may share your Personally&nbsp;Identifiable Information and other
information included in the submission with&nbsp;the challenge creator
or&nbsp;relevant Sponsor(s).</p>

<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>

<p>ChallengePost may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the
rights or property of ChallengePost, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect
the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against
legal liability.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>

<p>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In
the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar
event, challenges, activities or events may be part of the transferred
assets.</p>

receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the
“unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any ChallengePost marketing

always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription
databases. &nbsp;You cannot opt-out of receiving transactional e-mails related
to your account with ChallengePost. Personally Identifiable Information
provided to us that is contained in a submission to a challenge may not be

challenge, per the rules of each competition. Requests to remove such
information from a submission may be made after a challenge is over by emailing
us at &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@challengepost.com.</a></p>

the Site does not knowingly accept registrations from children under thirteen
years of age. and we do not intend to collect any Personally Identifiable

thirteen ask their parents for permission before sending any information about
themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

<p>If you suspect that your child under the age of thirteen has created an
account on the Site, please let us know by e-mailing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@challengepost.com</a>.</p>

<p>Although ChallengePost.com does not knowingly accept registrations from
users under the age of thirteen, minors can still enter and win contests by
having their parents or guardians register for ChallengePost.com on their
behalf. In cases where a challenge is open to children under thirteen, those
representing children under thirteen will be required to submit a parental
consent notice before their child’s submissions will be eligible to win the
contest.</p>

<p>By using the Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do
not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. Your continued
use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you

transactions are transmitted to a secure financial gateway, and we endeavor to
protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Credit card information is stored in an
encrypted form by Authorize.net, our payment gateway provider. However, we are
unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated
or compromised or that your data will remain secure under all
circumstances.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>ChallengePost is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of
your Personally Identifiable Information. You, too, need to strive to protect
against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing
off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>

the Site. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by
posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this
Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>

privacy is subject to this privacy policy and our Terms of Service, including
limitations on damages and application of Delaware state law.</p>

somewhere else, your actions are no longer subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
