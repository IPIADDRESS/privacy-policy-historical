  <p>Effective May 23, 2018</p>
<p>We at Devpost (formerly ChallengePost) have created this Privacy Policy because we know you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the Devpost website located at <a href="https://devpost.com">www.devpost.com</a> and its affiliated websites (collectively referred to as the "Site"), and how we may use and share that information. By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, the words "we," "us" and "our" refer to Devpost.</p>
<h2>Collected Information and Use</h2>
<p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Devpost ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, email address, password, and your location. Personally Identifiable Information will not be publicly displayed on the Site unless you give us permission to display specific information (such as your full name). Your password and email address will never be publicly displayed.</p>
<p>You may enter additional content including your biography; links to your Twitter, GIthub, Facebook, and LinkedIn profiles; a link to your personal website; a profile image; software projects and updates; comments, photos, a screen name, skills, college or university, degree type, major, grade point average, graduation date, employment history, jobs you have applied to, questions, suggestions, solutions, or other content or submissions (collectively referred to as the "User Content"). User Content may be viewable by the public. It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not submit any User Content that you do not want publicly displayed, and that nothing you submit includes proprietary information, information that’s illegal to make public, or personal information about you such as your social security number.</p>
<p>We use the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. For instance, we will use the Personal Information you input during the registration process to administer access to the Site and to award prizes by Devpost or the creator of a hackathon. We also use your Personal Information and other non-personal information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site and to better understand the users of our Site. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to update you about the Site and the hackathons we power. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>
<p>Devpost, or a third party service provider that does not have access to your Personal Information, may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Site. Our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a Devpost website. These server logs may include information such as the page(s) you visited, your Internet Protocol address, Devpost cookie information, web browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. Devpost uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server(s), analyze trends and administer the Site.</p>
<p>Individual hackathons may require you to submit additional information on the submission form and may include additional terms and conditions relating to privacy. If there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms posted or emailed for, or applicable to, a specific hackathon, the latter terms shall control with respect to that hackathon only.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our service. A cookie is a small data file that we may transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect Personally Identifiable Information. Devpost may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the SIte and our service.</p>
<p>You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies, but some Devpost features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<h2>Sharing your Information</h2>
<p>Devpost is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with certain third parties including those set forth below:</p>
<h3>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</h3>
<p>Devpost, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. For example, we may pass your Personally Identifiable Information to our designated service provider(s) in order to process payments, send mailings, and maintain databases. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them only with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<h3>Advertisers</h3>
<p>Devpost may aggregate your information with information of other users, and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, Devpost will never disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes without your express consent.</p>
<h3>Hackathons, Jobs, Activities and other Events</h3>
<p>Devpost may enter into collaborative relationships with other third parties on the Site with respect to hackathons, jobs, activities or events. If you participate in these hackathons, jobs, activities or events, you may be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information or to answer questions that seek your personal information. We may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties in conjunction with such hackathons, jobs, activities or events.</p>
<p>Specifically, if you register for an individual hackathon in order to receive updates and enter a submission, Devpost may share your Personally Identifiable Information with the hackathon creator or relevant sponsor(s) of the hackathon ("Sponsor(s)"). If you apply for a job, Devpost may share your Personally Identifiable Information and other information with the job poster in order to complete, analyze, or enhance your job application.</p>
<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Devpost may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Devpost, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, hackathons, activities or events may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
<h2>Accessing and Modifying Personally Identifiable Information and Communication Preferences</h2>
<p>You may access, review, and/or make changes to Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us by logging in on the Site, clicking on your username, then clicking "settings". In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located on the bottom of any Devpost marketing e-mails. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases. You cannot opt-out of receiving transactional e-mails related to your account with Devpost. Personally Identifiable Information provided to us that is contained in a submission to a hackathon may not be edited after the competition submission deadline until the conclusion of the hackathon, per the rules of each competition. Requests to remove such information from a submission may be made after a hackathon is over by emailing us at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:support@devpost.com">support@devpost.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Devpost is not directed at individuals under thirteen years of age, the Site does not knowingly accept registrations from children under thirteen years of age. and we do not intend to collect any Personally Identifiable Information from such individuals. We recommend that minors over the age of thirteen ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p>If you suspect that your child under the age of thirteen has created an account on the Site, please let us know by e-mailing <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:support@devpost.com">support@devpost.com</a>.</p>
<p>Although Devpost.com does not knowingly accept registrations from users under the age of thirteen, minors can still enter and win contests by having their parents or guardians register for Devpost.com on their behalf. In cases where a hackathon is open to children under thirteen, those representing children under thirteen will be required to submit a parental consent notice before their child’s submissions will be eligible to win the contest.</p>
<h2>Your Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>By using the Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
<h2>Credit Card Security</h2>
<p>Devpost does not store credit card information. Any credit card transactions are transmitted to a secure financial gateway, and we endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Credit card information is stored in an encrypted form by Stripe, our payment gateway provider. However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your data will remain secure under all circumstances.</p>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Devpost is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personally Identifiable Information. You, too, need to strive to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>
<h2>Archives</h2>
<p>Devpost may keep copies of user information, or other content provided by you, after their removal from the site in archive storage. This archive storage may include past versions of stored items that have since been modified or deleted.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy at any time by simply posting such modification on the Site. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<h2>Conditions of Use</h2>
<p>If you decide to visit the Site, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this privacy policy and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages and application of Delaware state law.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Devpost.com has links to other websites. Once you follow a link to somewhere else, your actions are no longer subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</h2>
<p>The servers that store Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site are operated in the United States or at one of our other data centers located outside the United States. Please be aware that your Information may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your country of origin.
