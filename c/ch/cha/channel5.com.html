We may collect data about you and your use of the website in one of three ways.
<br>
<b>I)</b> We may ask you for information about yourself when you register for one of our fan clubs, enter a competition, register for promotions, request brochures or information or provide information or comment to a particular programme. You are in control of the information you provide about yourself but if you choose not to share your information with us some of the areas of the website may not be accessible to you.
<br>
<b>II)</b> We may collect anonymous information about your use of the website from cookies. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser. Most browsers accept them automatically but they can be deleted and you may set your browser so you do not receive cookies in the future. We may match information gathered from cookies to the information you choose to give about yourself.
<br>
<b>III)</b> We may also collect Internet Protocol addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration. We do not link these addresses to any person's name or other identifying information.
<br><br>
<b>Use of Data</b>
<br>
The principle reason for collecting data about you is to improve the service we offer and to try and ensure you get the most from the website. We may also retain data for security administration, legal, and maintenance purposes. The use of cookies enables us to recognise you when you return to the website. This saves your time by avoiding re-registration and helps us understand what interests you on the website allowing us to make the information we provide relevant to you. By using the data collected we can provide you with information about Five via the website by e-mail or SMS.
<br><br>
<b>Third Parties</b>
<br>
We will not pass on your data to third parties unless you have explicitly given us permission to do so when providing us with that data or where this is necessary to provide you with the goods or service you have requested. If you decide to authorise us to do so we will only disclose your data to selected and reputable third party companies we think may be of interest to you. This may involve sending your data outside the European Economic Area. 
<br><br>
<b>Chat Rooms</b>
<br>
The Five website provides chat rooms and may make news groups available to users. Users of these services are warned that such chat rooms and news groups are public discussion forums. Any personal information supplied by users is widely accessible. Five and our related companies are not responsible for the content posted on these services. Use or exchange of profane or sexually explicit comments or material on the website chat rooms is prohibited. In particular users must not make sexually explicit or suggestive comments to minors.  The posting of any unlawful material is also prohibited.
<br><br>
<b>How you may amend data submitted by you</b>
<br>
We have designed the website to make it easy for you to access information held about you and to amend personal data you have submitted on any online membership registration form. When you log in you will be given a link that allows you to edit your details. If you require any further guidance on updating the details we hold about you, please contact, in writing, either the Five Duty Office or the Five Webmaster. Whenever you are contacted by e-mail you will be told how to opt out of being updated by e-mail in the future.
<br><br>
<b>Links to other websites</b>
<br>
We use links to improve your experience of our website. We will always seek to make these links clear, so that you know you have left our website. However, please be aware that third party websites are owned and run by other companies and organisations and we cannot accept responsibility for any information you choose to divulge to a linked website, or any contracts you may enter into via or with a linked website.

<b>Users 16 and under</b>
<br>
If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide personal information to the website. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.
