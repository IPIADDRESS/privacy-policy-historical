          <h2>Types of Information Collected</h2>
          <p>In order to provide this site and our numerous services, we collect two types of information on our site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
          <p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that identifies you specifically. When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities; however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personally identifying information. When ordering products or services on the site, you may also be asked to provide payment information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
          <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. This information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and your interactions while on our site. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a network, such as the World Wide Web. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</p>
          <h2>Collection Methods and Use of Information</h2>
          <p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you on this site unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you (a) register for our services and register your e-mail address with us; (b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) sign up for special offers from us or from selected third parties; (d) send e-mail messages, submit forms, post to forums, or transmit other information by telephone, e-mail or letter; or (e) submit your payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our site. We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.</p>
          <p>In addition, we, or our third-party ad server, search provider and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and/or software, to administer our site, and to gather demographic information. Our third-party ad servers may also provide us with reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our site.</p>
          <p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to (a) to provide our services to you, (b) to allow us to properly maintain this site and our services and to make improvements or upgrades when necessary, (c) to provide you with technical support and for system maintenance, (d) to inform you of new products or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to your inquiries or send administrative notices, (e) to prevent fraud, including the unauthorized use of this site or our services or violations of applicable policies and terms of service, or (f) to ensure our own compliance with the law. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you, including any website terms of use or this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h2>Release of Information</h2>
          <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you have affirmatively agreed to such disclosure. Charter may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with some of our same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes. We do provide some of our services or provide parts of this site through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners, and other third parties. We and our service partners may use your Personally Identifiable Information to deliver these services and to operate our site.</p>
          <p>As part of our business activities, if we enter into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information as part of the transaction.</p>
          <p>Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation or when otherwise permitted by applicable law. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use this site for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
          <h2>User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h2>
          <p>If you do not wish to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this site, then you should not provide it when requested or otherwise provide your information to this site. However, some parts of this site or our service may not function without the requested information. If you would like limit our use of your Non-Personally Identifiable Information to target advertisements on this site, please <a href="https://connect.charter.com/cas/portal/settings/charterweboptout.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a>. We may, from time to time, send you marketing messages (e.g., email, direct mail, telephone calls, etc.) regarding our products and services. If you do not want to receive these marketing messages from Charter Business, please follow the opt-out instructions in the message or send your Charter Business opt-out request by calling 1- 800-314-7195.</p>
          <h2>Security of Information</h2>
          <p>Charter takes the security of your Personally Identifiable Information seriously. We take such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter to Personally Identifiable Information. Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information when it collects such information over this site. Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. Charter limits access to databases containing Personally Identifiable Information to authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the use and release sections above.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
          <p>You need to help protect the privacy of your own information. You should not give Personally Identifiable Information to strangers or others whom you are not certain have a right or need to the information. You also must take precautions to protect the security of any Personally Identifiable Information that you may transmit by using encryption and other techniques to help prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your Personally Identifiable Information. You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks in your home or elsewhere. Charter will never ask you to provide account sign-in passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information through unsolicited email messages. If we request such information from you, we will always direct you to Charter's website. You should, however, be aware of imposter websites pretending to be Charter's. If you have received an email requested that you sign in or provide information that you suspect was not sent by Charter, DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINK IN THE EMAIL but use your own browser to go to Charter's site. If you are directed to a website that you not believe is Charter's, please contact Charter at 1- 800-314-7195 or forward the full email (with full Internet headers) to phishing@charter.net. Charter will also not ask for you Internet account password over the telephone.</p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>When you use our site we may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies may store Personally Identifiable Information and/or Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, your computer, or your preferences so that you may more easily use our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain a more secure site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case.</p>
          <p>We partner with one or more third-party service providers to display advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on your computer or utilize other means such as, web beacons, clear GIFs, pixel tags or other similar technologies, to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visit to our site and to target advertisements for our products and services. We and our third-party service provider will collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, your interaction with our products and services, and whether you responded to a particular ad. If you would like more information about how we target advertisements on this site and to know your choices about not having this Non-Personally Identifiable Information used by our third-party service providers for this purpose, please <a href="https://connect.charter.com/cas/portal/settings/charterweboptout.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a>. Other advertisers may also place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to them. Because a "Do Not Track" protocol has not yet been finalized, this site's information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that it provides to you, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.</p>

We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies.

          <h2>Note to California Customers Regarding Your Privacy Rights</h2>
          <p>California law requires Charter provide to you, upon request, certain information regarding the sharing of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

If you make a request by using the below Website Privacy methods of contact, Charter will provide you with the number of its same-branded affiliates in California and a list of personal information that it may have shared with some or all such same-branded affiliates.</p>
          <h2>Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</h2>
