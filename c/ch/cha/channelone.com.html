								<p><i>We at ChannelOne.com care about your safety and privacy. That's why we've set up this area of our site to tell you about our Online Privacy Policy. We'll tell you what personally identifiable information of yours may be collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information that ChannelOne.com has about you; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </i></p><p></p>

								<p><strong>CHANNELONE.COM PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
Thank you for visiting <a href="http://www.channelone.com" target="blank" class="color_blue">www.channelone.com</a> ("the Site")!  The Site is strongly committed to protecting your privacy.  The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform users of the Site as to what information we collect and how and why we use such information.  The Site is a website owned and operated by Channel One, LLC.
</p><p>
Disclosure Regarding Collection and Use of Personal Information
Through the Site, users may enter Personal Information about themselves. This Policy explains our online information collection and use practices and the choices you can make about the way we use and share such information. Please take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your Personal Information. Please note that our online information collection and use practices may differ from our practices regarding information obtained offline.
</p><p>
<strong>REMEMBER: IF YOU MAKE USE OF THE SITE, REGISTER WITH THE SITE, REQUEST INFORMATION THAT WE MAY OFFER OR SUBMIT INFORMATION IN ANY WAY TO OR THROUGH THE SITE YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. AS WE UPDATE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICES, THIS POLICY MIGHT CHANGE, SO PLEASE REVIEW IT FROM TIME TO TIME.</strong></p><p></p>
							
						
							
								<p></p><p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
 
We may collect information about you through a variety of methods, such as games, quizzes, contests, participation in our chat rooms, forums or the like or from other documents that you submit to us, transactions in which you may engage with us or our affiliated companies, via phone or through other modes of communication or through visits that you may make to the Site. This Policy applies to all personally identifiable information that we collect and maintain about our users, including any contact information (e.g., name and address), financial information (e.g., account and credit history), federal loan history information (e.g., loan amount, loan type, school and lender) or identifying information (e.g., social security number, date of birth) that we may obtain in connection with providing services ("Personal Information").  You may view or change your information at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@channelone.com" class="color_blue">privacy@channelone.com</a>. </p><p></p>
							
						
							
								<p></p><p><strong>Other Collected Information</strong><br>
We also may collect certain non-Personal Information (i.e. generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS), the IP address you are using to connect to the Site and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink). </p><p>
<strong>How We Use Your Personal Information </strong><br>

The Site uses your Personal Information to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications and to get in touch with you when necessary. For example, the Site may use your Personal Information to communicate with you or to send you information that you have requested. In addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey.  We do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy. Thus, we may also share Personal Information provided online with companies affiliated with or owned directly or indirectly by our parent company, <a href="http://www.alloymarketing.com" target="blank" class="color_blue">Alloy, Inc.</a> ("Alloy").  Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on Personal Information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy and your expressed preferences.  For example, a family company may send to you an e-mail regarding special offers and announcements about products or services that it thinks might be of interest to you. A family company may also contact you offline. If you want to opt-out from Channel One's database (or from that of a family company) using the Personal Information you provided in these ways, please <a href="mailto:privacy@channelone.com" class="color_blue">email us</a>. </p><p>
 </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>Updating or Removing Your Personal Information </strong><br>
Please <a href="mailto:privacy@channelone.com" class="color_blue">email us</a> at any time to update or remove your Personal Information.</p><p>
<strong>How We Share Your Personal Information</strong><br>

We will not share with third parties the Personal Information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); (d) with other persons or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make material changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. Examples of us sharing your Personal Information for the purposes submitted are if you participate in a third-party survey or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to such third party so that they can send to you directly the information you requested. We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending an e-mail). As stated above, we do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy and may also share Personal Information provided online with companies affiliated with or owned directly or indirectly by Alloy.  Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on Personal Information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. If you want us to stop sharing your Personal Information among Alloy-owned companies, please <a href="mailto:privacy@channelone.com" class="color_blue">email us</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally, with your consent, we may share the Personal Information you provide online with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline. We will seek to obtain your consent either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). Companies with whom we might share your Personal Information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers. If you want us to stop sharing your Personal Information with these companies, please <a href="mailto:privacy@channelone.com" class="color_blue">email us</a>. If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your Personal Information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies. 
</p><p>
If we do share Personal Information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your Personal Information. </p><p>
<strong>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information</strong><br>

We sometimes use the non-Personal Information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.   </p>
							
						
							
								<p><strong>Email Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
If you would prefer not to receive email updates from us that may relate, for example, to new services or offerings, or other email notifications, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by <a href="mailto:privacy@channelone.com" class="color_blue">emailing us</a>.</p>
							
						
							
								<p></p><p><strong>Collection of Information by Others</strong><br>

The Site may contain links to other websites, including links that are placed there by us, such as third-party advertisements or text hyperlinks.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all users of the Site to be aware of when they leave the Site, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects Personal Information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Site, through the Site.</p><p>
We may offer additional e-mail services or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain information.</p>
							
						
							
								<p></p><p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>

To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other Personal Information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to provide the Personal Information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. </p><p>

We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how the Site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to the Site). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. If you do that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit the Site in order to participate in certain functions of the Site. You should also know that companies that advertise on the Site (and their agents) might use their own cookies. This policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. </p><p>
<strong>Clickstream Data</strong><br>

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "Clickstream Data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-Personal Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve the Site. Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregate. </p>
							
						
							
								<p></p><p><strong>Supplementing Information</strong><br>

From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources. </p><p>
<strong>Discussions and Community Tools</strong><br> 

We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may use publicly posted information. </p><p>
<strong>Our Commitment to Security</strong><br>

We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online as well as offline. Whenever Personal Information is passed on to non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we require that they also have in place the appropriate safeguards. We cannot, however, guarantee that they do so. </p><p></p>
