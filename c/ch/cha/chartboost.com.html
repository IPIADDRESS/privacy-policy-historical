	website at www.chartboost.com, (the "Site") and Chartboost's other online services. If you have any
	concerns about privacy on the Site, please send an email to privacy@chartboost.com and we will try to
	address it.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">1 - COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</div>
	
	<p>You may be asked to provide personal information in certain felds on this website. The personal information
	collected on this site is used for the purpose for which it is requested:</p>
	
	<ul class="numbered">
	
		<li>Contact information for potential clients or persons seeking business information is collected in order to
		contact those persons to provide information about our services. This information may be stored on our
		servers in the United States. Such information is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal
		course of business, but can be amended or deleted upon request. To update your information, please
		contact your account manager or sales representative.</li>
		
		<li>Contact information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address, submitted by
		existing customers with questions, concerns, complaints, or technical support questions, is used only to
		respond to those inquiries. This contact information may be stored on our servers in the United States.
		Such information is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business. To update
		your information, please contact your account manager.</li>
		
		<li>When you sign up for an email newsletter or alerts about our products and services, Chartboost will use
		your email address to deliver the newsletter or alerts requested. To review or delete your information or
		to opt-out of any newsletter, please follow unsubscribe instructions in that email.</li>
		
		<li>In order to obtain materials for certain materials directly from our website, you have to register at this
		site. During the registration process, you may be asked for certain information, which may include your
		name, your email address, the company for which you work, and your country. This registration
		information is used to validate users when they visit the site. It is also used to send you additional
		promotional information about our services. If you were entered in a Chartboost promotion in

	</ul>
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">2 - COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</div>
	
	<p>The ads.chartboost.com and www.chartboost.com websites (Chartboost Sites) use cookies. A "cookie" is a
	small text fle that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that may be
	used at the Chartboost Sites: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie gets entered by
	your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your computer and remains in this "Cookies" folder after you
	close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. A
	session cookie is held temporarily in your computer?s memory and disappears after you close your browser
	or shut off your computer. Chartboost Sites may also use Web beacons (also called "clear GIFs" or "pixel
	tags") in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page.</p>
	
	<p>If you have arrived at this website by clicking on a banner ad for one of our products or services, a session
	cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an identifcation number for the ad that you clicked on, or will
	contain an identifcation number for the site that you were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad. This
	session cookie helps Chartboost's Marketing Department determine which of our ads attract the most
	visitors. If, after you arrive at our site, you choose to request further information from us about our products
	and services, the personal information that you provide in that request will be linked to the information in the
	session cookie. This also helps Chartboost's Marketing Department measure the effectiveness of our advertising. This "linking" will not be used to target future advertisements to you or to send you emails about
	future goods and services. You will receive emails about our products only if you tell us on the product
	request page that you want us to send them to you. Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once
	you have closed your browser. If you return to our site via another one of our ads, you will appear as a new
	visitor unless and until you provide further personal information.</p>
	
	<p>Chartboost Sites may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log fles (such
	as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity at this site to better understand how
	the website is used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your experience at this site. Information from
	website analysis cookies or about website usage is not combined with information from any other
	Chartboost cookie. We use a third-party email technology to send emails that you have agreed to receive.
	Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, Chartboost may serve ads on this and other websites using our own ad serving technology. In
	doing so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your computer and will use
	non-personal information about your browser and your activity at this site to serve ads on this and other
	sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">3 - INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE</div>
	
	<p>In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of the information or service that you
	have requested, Chartboost may provide your information to such third party, or such third party may collect
	information from you on our behalf. By written agreement, these third parties are required to implement
	similar security measures and to process your information only as authorized by Chartboost to fulfll the
	service(s) that they have been contracted to provide. Other than these entities, who act on our behalf,
	information you provide at this site will not be transferred to unrelated third parties, unless we have your
	permission to do so. However, please note that personal information provided to this site may be subject to
	disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders. In addition, we may also
	disclose personal information to third parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, merger or
	amalgamation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">4 - AD SERVING</div>
	
	<p>When we serve a text ad on a Chartboost site or app or on the sites or apps of our partners, those ads may
	be served based on a variety of factors, including: your recent search or content activity, the language we
	believe you prefer when performing such activity, and standard log information, including cookie information,
	IP address, browser/device type, device operating system or platform, unique device identifer and the date
	and time of your request.</p>
	
	<p>When we serve text and display ads on certain Chartboost services and Chartboost partner sites and apps,
	those ads may be served based on a variety of factors including: the content, domain, and language of the
	page or app where the ad is displayed; and the standard log information described above. To serve ads that
	are relevant and tailored to your interests, we may use information about your activity on Chartboost partner
	sites and apps or Chartboost services that use the Chartboost system. Some of these sites, apps and
	services also may use non-personally identifying information, such as demographic data, to provide relevant
	advertising. Our Chartboost partners and Chartboost services may display ads from both Chartboost
	advertisers and other third-party ad serving companies, including other ad networks, provided they comply
	with Chartboost's third-party ad serving requirements.</p>
	
	<p>When we serve an ad to you, we may generate a cookie based on your mobile device?s unique identifer,
	which is a permanent number assigned to your device by its manufacturer or carrier partner. A cookie is a
	text fle, consisting of a series of random numbers and letters that serves as a pseudonymous identifer for
	your browser, but does not identify you. We use cookies or other technologies to record information about
	what ads you are shown, as well as what ads you click and other actions you take on our sites, apps and
	services. Cookies allow us to serve more relevant and useful ads to you. The following describes how our
	cookies work to support our advertising services and conversion tracking, and how you can opt out of
	generating these cookies.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">5 - ADVERTISING COOKIES</div>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">The Chartboost Cookie</div>
	
	<p>Chartboost uses the Chartboost cookie on Chartboost partner sites and apps and certain Chartboost
	services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. When you use an app
	and view or click on an ad served through these apps, we may generate the Chartboost cookie and
	associate it with your device.</p>
	
	<p>You may view and manage your advertising preferences or opt out of the generation of the Chartboost
	cookie at any time, as described below.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">How we use the Chartboost cookie information</div>
	
	<p>We use the advertising cookie information collected on Chartboost partner sites and apps and certain
	Chartboost sites and apps to:</p>
	
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>
			Enable the following ad serving features:
			<ul>
				<li>Frequency Capping: Prevents users from seeing the same ad over and over
				again;</li>
				
				<li>Spam fltration: Uses cookies as one of many signals that allow us to identify
				invalid clicks (or ad queries) and to protect our advertisers from fraudulent
				behavior;</li>
				
				<li>View-Through Conversions: Provides insight to advertisers on how many people
				who were exposed to an ad, didn?t click, but subsequently visited the advertiser?s
				website;</li>
				
				<li>Interest-Based Advertising: Allows advertisers (including Chartboost) to serve
				ads to users on Chartboost partner apps and certain Chartboost apps and
				services based on online activity and interests associated with the Chartboost
				cookie and to serve subsequent ads to you after you leave that advertiser?s
				website.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Audit, research, and analyze the data in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services;</li>
		<li>Ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly; and</li>
		<li>Develop new services.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The advertising cookie information described above is provided to advertisers and publishers who use our
	advertising services. In addition, Chartboost or our advertising and publishing customers may use web
	beacons in conjunction with the Chartboost cookie to collect information about your exposure to a particular
	advertisement.</p>
	
	<p>Chartboost will not combine Chartboost cookie information from Chartboost partner apps or Chartboost
	services that use the Chartboost cookie with:</p>
	
	<ul class="disc">
		<li>Your personally-identifying information without your opt-in consent; or</li>
		
		<li>Information collected by Chartboost's advertising customers without their explicit permission. With
		such permission, Chartboost may use and combine that information only in accordance with the
		Chartboost Privacy Policy.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">6 - MANAGING YOUR ADS PREFERENCES</div>
	
	<p>Chartboost strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising. Based on activity on our Chartboost
	partner sites and apps and Chartboost services that use the Chartboost cookie, we may associate the
	cookie with relevant interest categories. Chartboost then uses these categories to show interest-based ads
	on these sites and apps. Chartboost will not associate sensitive interest categories with the Chartboost
	cookie (such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive fnancial categories)
	and will not use these categories when showing you interest-based ads.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">7 - CONVERSION TRACKING</div>
	
	<p>Chartboost also uses a cookie to measure advertising performance for advertisers who have opted-in to
	conversion tracking on Chartboost and its Chartboost partners. The conversion tracking cookie is generated
	when a user clicks on an ad delivered by Chartboost where the advertiser has opted-in to tracking. These
	cookies expire within 30 days and are not personally-identifable. If this cookie has not yet expired when the
	user visits certain pages of the advertiser?s website, Chartboost and the advertiser will be able to tell that the user clicked the ad and proceeded to that page. Each advertiser gets a different cookie, so no cookie can be tracked across advertiser websites and apps.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">How we use the conversion cookie information</div>
	
	<p>We use the information collected by the conversion cookie to provide aggregate conversion stats to
	advertisers who have opted-in to conversion tracking. Advertisers are able to see the total number of users
	who have clicked on their ad and proceeded to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag, but they do not
	have access to personally identifying information.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">8 - PRIVACY POLICIES OF OTHER ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS</div>
	
	<p>Chartboost requires customers that display Chartboost ads to comply with all applicable laws, including data
	protection laws that require posting a privacy policy. We encourage all users to review the privacy policies of
	sites and apps they visit for information about those sites? data practices.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">9 - CONfDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</div>
	
	<p>Chartboost has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect both personal and non-
	personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. While
	we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent
	such occurrences.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">10 - COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</div>
	
	<p>In the event that your personally identifable information is compromised as a result of a known or suspected
	breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been
	compromised, in accordance with the notifcation procedures set forth in this privacy policy, or as otherwise
	required by applicable law.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">11 - NOTIfCATION PROCEDURES</div>
	
	<p>It is our policy to provide notifcations, whether such notifcations are required by law or are for marketing or
	other business related purposes, to our users via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through
	conspicuous posting of such notice on our web site page, as determined by us in its sole discretion.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing
	notifcations to our web site users.</p>
	
	<div class="normal bold paragraph_title">12 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</div>
	
	<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion. If we make changes to the Privacy
	Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site so you are always aware of what
	information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed. If we make any
	changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" date above.</p>
