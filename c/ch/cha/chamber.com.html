          <p>Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to  earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect  your privacy:</p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>We do not share, rent, trade or sell your       personally identifiable information to third parties other than as       described within this privacy policy.</li>
            <li>We do not share your contact information with       another User without your consent.</li>
            <li>Any personally identifiable information that       you provide will be secured with industry standard protocols and       technology.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This privacy policy covers&nbsp;<a href="http://chamber.com/" target="_blank">www.chamber.com</a>.  It does not, however, apply to entities that Chamber.com does not own or  control. By using or accessing Chamber.com, you agree to our privacy practices  outlined here.<br>
            We reserve the right to modify this privacy  statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material  changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a  notice on our home page. By continuing to use the Chamber.com service after  notice of changes have been sent to you or published on the Chamber.com  website, you are consenting to the changes.<br>
  <strong>1. Personal  Information Collected</strong> <br>
            The purpose of the Chamber.com website is to permit  Users to voluntarily provide information about themselves for the purposes of  developing, maintaining and enhancing a network of professional contacts. You  willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to  allow you to benefit from the Chamber.com website. If you have any hesitation  about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed  on the Chamber.com website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this  Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a member of the  Chamber.com community.<br>
  <br>
            We collect your personal information in the following ways:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Registration</strong><br>
            In order to become a User, you must first create an account on our website. To  create an account you are required to provide the following contact  information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal  information allowing others, including Chamber.com, to identify you: name,  email address, country, ZIP/postal code, a brief summary of your professional  background, and a password chosen by you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Profile Information</strong><br>
            Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile  section describing your skills, professional and educational experiences, and  networking objectives. You may also provide demographic information such as  age, gender, relationship status, interests/hobbies. You also have the ability  to upload photos. Please be aware that all users may view your photos.  Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration to  become a User is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself  and find new opportunities in the Chamber.com system to build and leverage your  professional network. Any information you provide at registration or in the  Profile section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same  manner and extent to which other information that is not personally  identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of  serving advertisements through the service. If you opt-out you may lose the  potential benefit of being a User, including receiving ads that are more  targeted to your interests.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Contacts Information</strong><br>
            We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends' addresses so  that you can find your friends on Chamber.com, and invite your contacts who do  not have accounts to join. In order to invite others to connect with you  directly in Chamber.com, you may use the Chamber.com services to invite them if  they are a User, or enter their names and email addresses. This information  will be used by Chamber.com to send your friend email invitations on your  behalf including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of  people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.  If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your  password after you have uploaded your contacts' information.<br>
  <br>
            You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into  the private “My contacts” section of the Chamber.com website. All information  that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms  of this privacy policy as cover your own information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
            Chamber.com may collect information such as your name and email address through  the Chamber.com website or through the Customer Service website in order to,  among other things, accurately categorize and respond to a customer's inquiry  and deliver appropriate service levels.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
            Like most websites, Chamber.com uses cookies and web log files to track site  usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows  Chamber.com to recognize you as a User when you return to the Chamber.com  website using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do  not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the Chamber.com website. Like  the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log  file data is used to customize your experience on our website.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
            One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you've logged  in to your Chamber.com account. The next time you visit the Chamber.com  website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing  User by your email address and password, so you will not need to log in before  using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information  (like a credit card number), however, you must log in securely again with your  password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.<br>
  <br>
            We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User  preferences and tracking User trends. Most browsers are initially set up to  accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to  indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings  do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to  use the Chamber.com website or services. Chamber.com does not store personally  identifiable information in the cookies.<br>
  <br>
            In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we  may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on  your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies  will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment  information, e.g. your industry or geographic location, your occupation, or  information about your professional or educational background, for greater  customization of your user experience. The use of cookies set by these third  parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control  over these cookies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
  “” We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to  Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology  vendors and research firms. Chamber.com may “target” some ads to Users that fit  a certain general profile - for example, “product managers in Texas.” Chamber.com does NOT use personally  identifiable information to target ads.<br>
  <br>
            To deliver these ads properly, Chamber.com may include a file, called a web  beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Chamber.com so the  networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting  for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites.<br>
  <br>
            Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from  the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own  cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.<br>
  <br>
            These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads  on other websites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. Chamber.com does  not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other  third party.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer</strong><br>
            Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the  Chamber.com web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which  you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Chamber.com. We also  receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy  server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system  and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of  your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve  the Chamber.com service. The linkage between your IP address and your  personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without  your permission or except when required by law.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Consent to Chamber.com Processing Information About You</strong><br>
            Certain information you provide to Chamber.com may reveal, or allow others to  identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion or other aspects of your  private life, and more generally about you. Please be aware that in providing  information to Chamber.com for the purposes of opening your user account, you  are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this  Privacy Policy and Chamber.com's User Agreement. The supplying of all such information  by you to Chamber.com, including all information deemed “sensitive” by  applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to  withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy  Policy and the User Agreement, but please note that your withdrawal of consent  will not be retroactive.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You</strong><br>
            You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data about you  which has been collected pursuant to your decision to become a User. If you  update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information which you  originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein.<br>
            We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to  be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by filling out the&nbsp;<a href="mailto:abuse@bizchamber.com" target="_blank">abuse@chamber.com</a>&nbsp;or  contacting us at:<br>
            Chamber.com<br>

  <strong>2. Uses of personal  information</strong> <br>
            Chamber.com is an online service dedicated to  helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one another.  The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on our website is  used to help you describe yourself to other Users, to send you newsletters, as  well as fulfill your order of a premium or sponsored membership. Other  information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is  collected by Chamber.com from Users (such as, for example, patterns of  utilization) and is exclusively owned by Chamber.com. This information can be  utilized by Chamber.com in such manner as Chamber.com, in its sole discretion,  deems appropriate.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Services</strong><br>
            Chamber.com may offer our services in connection with other websites (including  updates about the Chamber.com service) or may team with marketing partners,  affiliated companies, and other online services to give you the combined  results of both services or additional services and benefits (“Partners”).<br>
  <br>
            We only work with trusted Partners. To report any suspected misuse of  information contact:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:abuse@bizchamber.com" target="_blank">abuse@chamber.com</a>. Chamber.com is not  responsible for your use of or inability to use any services or products of  Partners, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of such applications  and their privacy practices.<br>
  <strong>Chamber.com  Communications</strong><br>
            Chamber.com will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the  Chamber.com website or through other means available through the service. These  include a series of welcome emails which help inform new Users about various  features of the service. Please be aware that you will always receive certain  emails from Chamber.com related to the proper functioning of your account, such  as email notices when another User in your network sends you an  opportunity.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
            Chamber.com, and/or our Partners, may regularly send out newsletters, weekly  status emails, or promotional emails. Chamber.com may send you promotional  information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. You can  change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by amending your email  notification choices. In newsletters and weekly status emails, Chamber.com  and/or our Partner may inform you, among other things, about new features,  about your events in the upcoming week, about specific personal statistics from  the respective past calendar week (i.e. the number of hits on your Profile,  whether you have new contacts to be confirmed and/or new private messages,  etc.), or about education content. You may choose to unsubscribe from the  newsletter at any time by sending an email to the link provided at the end of  each newsletter.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Online Directory:</strong><br>
            We utilize an online directory so that users may find each other on our Web  site. Within our directory we will display your name and email address. Since  this directory is a major function of our Web site, if you do not want to be  part of the directory, you should not register on our site.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Customized Content</strong><br>
            Information provided to Chamber.com is also used to customize your experience  on our website. For example, when you login to your account we will display the  screen names of new Users who have recently joined your network.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
            Chamber.com takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not share, sell,  rent, trade or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to  third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy. We will only  share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out  your instructions or to provide specific services or information. For instance,  we use a credit card processing company to bill Users for subscription fees. We  also use PayPal to process payments should you choose to use that payment  gateway. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally  identifiable information except to provide these services and they are bound by  confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Feedback.</strong><br>
            We use a third party service provider to host our feedback page. You may submit  contact information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or email  address, in connection with feedback, concerns, complaints, questions, or  technical support. Such information is used only to respond to those inquiries  and is governed by this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
            We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our services to  third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be  appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on Chamber.com. We may  segment our Users by role (i.e. product managers, vice presidents), industry,  geographic location, or company.<br>
  <strong>Surveys and Polls</strong><br>
            As a User, you will receive requests to participate in market research  including polls and surveys submitted by other Chamber.com members. If you  participate in surveys and polls offered through our website, the information  you provide may be visible to others using the Chamber.com website.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Forums/Chats/Blogs</strong><br>
            If you post a message or use a bulletin board on Chamber.com, you should be  aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there  can be read, collected, or used by other Users of these forums, as well as  third parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Chamber.com  is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to  submit in these forums.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Testimonials and Advertisement Placed through Chamber.com</strong><br>
            If you provide any testimonials about the Chamber.com service or place  advertisements through the Chamber.com, we may post those testimonials and  examples of advertisements you place in connection with Chamber.com's promotion  of its service to third parties, which testimonials and advertisements may  include your name and other personal information that you have provided. We do  obtain the clients consent prior to posting their name along with their  testimonial.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Communications to other Users</strong><br>
            Many emails you initiate through Chamber.com, e.g., an invitation sent to a  non-User, may list your email address and name in the header of the  message.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
            It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required  by law, such as responses to civil or criminal subpoenas, or other requests by  law enforcement personnel. We will disclose such information wherein we have a  good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing  judicial proceeding, subpoena, or other legal process or request to Chamber.com  brought in any country throughout the world, or to exercise our legal rights or  defend against legal claims.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Disclosures to others</strong><br>
            We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to  another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of a  Chamber.com division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell  Chamber.com's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and  other information that you provide to us. You will be notified via email or  prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or  control of your personal information.<br>
  <strong>3. Your Information  Choices</strong> <br>
  <strong>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</strong><br>
            You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired  changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your Chamber.com  account including your email, and contact preferences, at any time by logging  in to your account and accessing the “My Updates” section. Please be aware that  even after your request for a change is processed, Chamber.com may, for a time,  retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of  its database.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Closing Your Account</strong><br>
            If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When  you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be  deleted. We save your profile information (friends, photos, interests, etc.) in  case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their  accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their  information until they return to Chamber.com. You will still have the ability  to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you  delete an account, it is permanently deleted. You should only delete your  account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. We may retain  certain data contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent  fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of  aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required  by law.<br>
  <strong>4. Your Obligations</strong> <br>
            As a User, you have certain obligations toward the  other Users with whom you will be communicating.
