    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>July 2007</p>

<p>As an ethical company, we take the privacy of our users very seriously.  We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect about you, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at help@changents.com.   </p>

<p><u>What This Privacy Policy Covers </u></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers Changents' treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or become a registered user of the Changents Service. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as your real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address.  Information that we use internally to identify you as a registered user in our system, such as your selected username, is not considered personally identifiable information.  </p>

<p><u>What This Privacy Policy Does Not Cover </u></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as but not limited to our partners, vendors and advertisers.  In addition, we may provide links to other services and other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of the Changents Service and may have their own privacy or security practices. For your best online experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.  </p>

<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT </h4>

<p><u>Required Registration Information </u></p>

<p>During the registration process, we collect required information about you including but not necessarily limited to your name, username, password, email address, mobile phone number, date of birth, gender, country of residence, postal code and action area (i.e. social or environmental interest areas).   </p>

<p><u>Optional Registration Information </u></p>

<p>You can choose to provide us with additional optional information about yourself in your registered user profile such as a photo of yourself, an avatar or other information as may be requested from time to time.   </p>

<p><u>Access To Your Personal Information</u></p>

<p>In general, we make it easy for you to view your profile and the personally identifiable information that we have collected from you in your password protected personal user account, where you can cancel add and edit information or cancel your account.   </p>

<p><u>Information Submitted During A Transaction </u></p>

<p>To the extent commerce offerings are made available to you on the Changents Service, we may collect information including your name, shipping and billing address(es), credit card information and other relevant data to process your payment transaction.  </p>

<h4>INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT  </h4>

<p><u>Children   </u></p>

<p>As explained further in our Terms of Service, currently available at www.changents.com/about/terms, you must be 18 years of age or older to use the Changents Service.  Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children.  If you believe that we have information from or about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us immediately by email at help@changents.com.  </p>

<p><u>Social Security Number </u></p>

<p>We do not ask or require your Social Security Number to use or access any part of the Changents Service.  No one representing Changents will ever ask for your Social Security Number.   If at any time you receive an e-mail requesting such information from someone purporting to represent the Company or the Changents Service, please notify us immediately.  </p>

<h4>INFORMATION WE TRACK  </h4>

<p><u>Log Files </u></p>

<p>We gather certain information about your actions on the Changents Service and automatically store it in our database and web server log files. This information may include but is not limited to your user name, unique IDs appended to URLs that you use in connection with the Changents Service, internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to facilitate custom features such as the Ripple and to deliver content or advertising that may be of interest to you based on your preferences and user behavior on the Changents Service.   In addition, this data helps us improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, understand the interests of our user base as a whole, select appropriate partners and sell good corporate citizen advertising to support the Changents Service. We also collect aggregate information which is data about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.  </p>

<p><u>Cookies   </u></p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, what pages they view during their visit, responses tied to send-to-a-friend and other Ripple-related actions, how much time they spend with certain content experiences, etc.  Similar to many websites, we store an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back to our website.  Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our site.  You can set your web browser software to disable cookies. To do so, please refer to the help section of your specific browser for more information about how to manage or disable cookies.  If you disable cookies, you may still view our site, but some areas of the Changents Service may not work as intended. Some of our business partners and advertisers may also use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies, and, as noted above, this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our business partners, vendors or advertisers.  </p>

<h4>HOW INFORMATION IS USED  </h4>

<p><u>In Company Communications </u></p>

<p>We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our website as our primary means to inform our registered users of important service and promotional announcements.  </p>

<p><u>System-related Announcements </u></p>

<p>We use your email address to deliver important system-related announcements.  Examples of system-related announcements include but are not limited to: email verification during registration, requests for password reset, important security or server maintenance updates, or policy changes.  These service-related announcements are considered a fundamental part of the Changents Service, and registered users cannot opt-out of these email announcements.  </p>

<p><u>Promotional Announcements </u></p>

<p>In order to improve the experience for our registered users, we will offer you the ability to sign up for optional communications, such as email updates about the Changents Service, or invitations.  These communications are enhancements to the Changents Service and are entirely optional.  We will ask for your consent before sending you promotional communications, and will make it easy for you to unsubscribe from these communications, either through emails or though your password protected personal user account.  </p>

Send-To-A-Friend Features <p></p>

<p>If you choose to use our send-to-a-friend features on the Changents Service, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site.   </p>

<p><u>Nominate a Change Agent </u></p>

<p>If you choose to nominate a private individual as a change agent on the Changents Service, we will ask you for your nominee’s name and email address.  We will automatically notify your nominee of the nomination and invite him or her to visit the site.   </p>

<p><u>The Ripple </u></p>

<p>The Ripple, a signature feature of Changents is a technology that will dynamically track and graphically represent the positive impact of Internet-based actions taken by Changents registered users as those actions spread virally from person to person, affecting the actions of others down the line.  Therefore, certain actions that you may take on the Changents Service, such as but not limited to invite a friend, forward content, nominate a change agent, recommend an action pack and the like will be trackable and viewable within the My Ripple feature of other users.  Similarly, other users that take actions as a result of a Ripple that you initiate within the Changents Service will be viewable in your My Ripple view. Changents will only display non-personally identifiable information in connection with the display of user actions in the My Ripple view.  </p>

<p><u>Identification Of Authors By Username   </u></p>

<p>The Changents website offers opportunities for registered users to vote and comment on content found on this website, engage in dialogue, share information, and submit original content such as videos, photos and other media.  This means that we depend on the contributions and actions of our registered users to improve the quality of the Changents Service experience.  When you make a contribution to the Changents Service (such as uploading a video), you may be identified by your username as the author of that contribution both on our website and on the websites of third parties such as Veoh to whom we distribute your content.  In these circumstances, we will only identify you by your username.  Other than the username which can be entirely made up, in using the Changents Service, you are not required to provide or publicize any personally identifiable information in connection with your contributions and actions on our website or any third party website with whom we may distribute your contribution.  </p>

<p><u>Public Profile </u></p>

<p>As the Changents Service evolves, we may create a public member profile based on your username.  You have the option to include personally identifiable information in your public profile, but you are not required to do so.
