Everyone must take caution before sending personal information over the Internet and through chatrooms. If you have discovered that your child (who is under 13) has registered for a message forum account, please email <a href="mailto:admin@chat-avenue.com">admin{@}chat-avenue.com</a> with your childs message forum username and we will have that account and any message postings he/she has made, removed immediately.</p>
  
        <h2>IMPORTANT NOTE:</h2>  <p>The "Kids Chat" is for older kids.  Specifically, users aged 13-16 years old. An age verification process has been implemented to prevent users, under the age of 13 and over the age of 16, to participate in the Kids chat. </p>
