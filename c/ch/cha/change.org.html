    1. Information we collect
  </h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <h4>
      To run our service and show you relevant content, we need to know a little
      about you and your interests. Here we outline what information Change.org collects,
  and how we collect it.
  </h4>
  </div>
  <h5>
    a. What we collect
  </h5>
  <p>
    When you sign or create a petition via our platform, an account is created for
    you. All your campaign activities are then tied to this account. By
  “campaign” we mean petitions, all the activities you can do to promote
  your petitions via our platform or through third-party sites and services, and any
  other action through our platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through these activities and upon your general use of our platform, we may collect
    and/or receive the following information about you that reveals your specific
  identity, or is directly tied to your specific identity:
  </p>
  <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>
      your name
    </li>
    <li>
      your postal address
    </li>
    <li>
      your telephone number
    </li>
    <li>
      your email address, or non-email authentication if you are using a mobile
      device
  </li>
  <li>
    your profile picture
  </li>
  <li>
    other information you voluntarily submit (for example: photos)
  </li>
  <li>
    your unique mobile device ID number if you access our services via a mobile
    application
  </li>
  <li>
    your social media account ID and information shared with us via your social
    media account
  </li>
  <li>
    your specific activities on the Change.org platform - for example, petitions
    you have started or signed, sponsored petitions you have signed, or campaigns you
  have shared or promoted
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    And possibly:
  </p>
  <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>
      information inferred about the issues you care about based on your activities
      on the platform (e.g. animal rights, climate change)
  </li>
  <li>
    information about you available in public records, or other publicly available
    databases, such as civic data APIs, which, as an example, we use in the United
  States to help match citizens with the elected officials who represent them at all
  levels in government
  </li>
  <li>
    information about you that we get from third party data providers. We obtain
    this data with assurance from these providers that you have consented to the
  collecting and sharing of this data. We don’t actively collect sensitive
  public data such as medical data. In addition, we only collect information that is
  permissible to collect in each country where we operate.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We also collect information that does not reveal your specific identity, or does
    not directly relate to you, such as:
  </p>
  <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>
      browser and device information
    </li>
    <li>
      information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies
    </li>
    <li>
      demographic information and other non-identifying information provided by you
      (such as a zip code or general geographic area)
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>
    b. How we collect it
  </h5>
  <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>
      When you register for the Change.org platform, you will be asked to create a
      user profile that includes information such as your user name, city, state, and
  country. You may choose to upload photos and provide additional information as
  well.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you are signed in to your account, your activities on the Change.org
    platform (for example: when you sign a petition, create a petition, share someone
  else’s petition, opt in to being contacted by an advertiser, or skip a
  sponsored campaign) are tracked and are associated with your account.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you download and use our existing or future mobile applications,
    we’ll collect your unique device ID and all your account and activity
  information will be tied to that unique device ID. In addition, we may track and
  collect app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses
  our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the app, and
  this information may be associated with your account.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you use a website that allows for the posting of content to Change.org
    through our Application Programming Interface (“API”), your activities
  are recorded as if they were directly on our site and applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may collect information through your activities offline, for example when
    you respond to user surveys or provide information if we assist you by
  telephone.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may obtain information about you from public records, publicly available
    databases, and third-party providers as described above.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may obtain certain information through your social media accounts connected
    to your Change.org account. If you log in to Change.org via Facebook, we ask for
  your permission to access certain information about your Facebook account,
  activities and friends. Social media sites make information available to all apps
  through their APIs, such as friend lists. The information we receive depends on
  what information you or the social media site decide to give us.
  </li>
  <li>
    Browser and device information: Certain information is collected by most
    browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control
  (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating
  system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser
  type and version, and the name and version of the Change.org platform you are
  using.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cookies and online tracking: We, our service providers, and any ad networks who
    help us deliver relevant ads to you may use cookies, pixel tags (also known as web
  beacons and clear GIFs), and other similar technologies to measure and track
  general user activities on Change.org and on third party websites. Like other
  websites, Change.org will not function properly if cookies are not enabled. Please
  review our <a href="https://www.change.org/about/cookie-policy" target="_blank"><em>Cookies Policy</em></a> for more information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Third-party analytics providers: We use third-party analytics services like
    Google Analytics provided by Google Inc. (“Google”) and the Mixpanel
  service provided by Mixpanel, Inc. (“Mixpanel”). These analytics
  services use cookies and similar technologies to analyze how people use our
  services and compile statistical reports. Such services may also collect
  information about Platform visitors’ use of other websites. For more
  information on your choices, please see our section below entitled <a href="#4" target="_blank">“Your privacy choices”</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    IP Address: Your “IP Address” is a designator that is automatically
    assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider
  (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log
  files whenever you use our platform and services, along with the time of your visit
  and the specific page(s) that you visited.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with
    personally identifiable information (for example, we may combine your name with your
  geographical location or combine your name with information about your activities on
  our platform). In such case the combined information will be treated by us as
  personally identifying information and protected accordingly.

    2. How we may use your information
  </h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <h4>
      Here are the ways we might use your information to run our platform, provide
      our services and serve you better content.
  </h4>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>
        We use your information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your
        requests, such as when you create petitions, sign petitions, or participate in
  other activities on Change.org platforms, sites, apps and third-party sites who
  use our API and to complete and fulfill your transactions with us.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need your contact information to send administrative information to you,
    for example, information regarding our services and changes to our terms,
  conditions, and policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use your information for general business purposes, such as data analysis,
    audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new services, enhancing,
  improving or modifying our Platform, identifying usage trends, determining the
  effectiveness of campaigns, and operating and expanding our business
  activities.
  </li>
  <li>
    We personalize your experience by presenting petitions, campaigns and offers
    tailored to you based on what we know about you. We may also send you promotional
  communications that we believe may be of interest to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use your information to allow you to participate in events and similar
    promotions and to administer these activities. Some of these activities have
  additional rules, which could contain additional information about how we use and
  disclose information about you, so we suggest that you read these rules
  carefully.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need information about your social media account and activities to
    facilitate social sharing functionality, such as sharing content and petitions
  through the Change.org platform and other social media platforms like Facebook
  and Twitter.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use your account information to allow you to send email messages to your
    email contacts through our platform, such as to share a petition. By using this
  feature, you guarantee that you have the right to to use and provide us the names
  and email addresses you submit.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use information about your computer or device to ensure that our site,
    apps and APIs function properly and are optimized for your computer or
  device.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are using one of our mobile applications, we use your device ID to
    recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and
  settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to measure and
    improve our services and develop features and functionalities on our sites, apps
  and APIs. For example, if we see that people using a certain device use the
  platform the most, we might decide to build an app specifically for that
  device.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to improve the
    relevance of our marketing campaigns and those of our advertisers. For example,
  if you signed a petition regarding the protection of animal rights, you may
  subsequently see sponsored campaigns from animal protection organizations.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use IP Addresses for administration and security purposes, such as
    calculating usage levels of our sites, apps and API, helping diagnose server
  problems and detecting fraud and spam behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may use and share aggregated and anonymized information to better
    understand and serve our users or for optimization of our marketing and ad
  targeting efforts. For example, we may compile statistics like the percentage of
  our users in a state or country who care about animal rights, or the age range of
  those users.

    very careful when deciding to disclose any information about yourself via the

  to you. We do not control the content or frequency of communications that you may
  receive from our advertisers.<br>

      Companies within the Change.org group of companies: We may share your

  <li>
    Law enforcement purposes: If requested or required by government authorities,

    relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your

    “About”; Scroll to the bottom of About and tap
    “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad Tracking” to ON. If you are

    </p>
    <p>
      You can also contact our Privacy Officer at the email address or mailing address
      listed at the bottom of this <a href="#8">Privacy Policy</a> and ask us to specify
      what information we have about you and to delete certain information about you from
      our records. Please let us know what information you would like us to remove from

      our use of your personal information. For your protection, we may only implement
      requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular
      email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your
      identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request

    <p>
      Please note that we may need to retain certain information for mandatory record
      keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to your
      request. There may also be residual information that will remain within our
      databases and other records, but such residual information will no longer be tied
      to your identity. For example, if you created a petition, we will have records that
      other Change.org users signed your petition. If you subsequently ask us to delete
      your information from our platform and databases, information related to those
      other users’ signatures cannot be removed and will remain in our records.
