          The Company maintains the right to send you information via the postal mail services 
          of your jurisdiction if such mailing is permissible pursuant to the laws of your

  please contact our help desk pursuant to Section 7 below.

      Your Personal Information (defined below) is not shared with any third parties

    <p>
      We do utilize tracking devices (“cookies”, “web beacons,” single-pixel gifs, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies are small files that store information about your account, web browser, 
      computer, mobile phone, or other device. Most companies on the web use cookies to 
      enable special features or to provide you with a better, faster, or safer experience.
      <br><br>
      We use cookies to make Change.org better and easier to use; to provide you with a 
      more personalized experience; and to protect you, others, and Change.org from malicious 
      activity. For example, we use cookies to store your login ID (but never your password) 
      so that it’s easier for you to log in when you return to the site. We also use cookies 
      to confirm that you’re logged in to Change.org.
      <br><br>
      We do not use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third-party 
      sites, although we may use anonymous or aggregate data to track overall usage of Change.org.
      <br><br>
      You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases, 
      this may impact your ability to use Change.org.

      Except as noted below, you have complete control over the emails you receive from us. 
      To edit your email settings, login to your account, click on “Settings” and select

      right at all times to contact its members for business related purposes (some examples 
      include, but are not limited to: (i) if a user requests a new password, (ii) if the 
      Company chooses to alert its users about an update to this Privacy Policy or its Terms 
      of Service, or (iii) in response to an action taken by you using the Company’s products 
      and/or services, such as signing a petition or updating your profile).

  <li>
    <p>
      You have complete control over who may see your profile. To edit your privacy settings, 
      login to your account, click on “Settings” and select “Privacy.” Please note, the initial 
      setting for your profile is private. If you set your profile to public, anyone can view it 
      and your profile may be indexed by internet search engines; both of these may be changed 
      following the directions provided above.

        <p>
          As part of the registration process, we collect your name, email address, and mailing 
          address (your “Personal Information”). We may additionally track data (including data 
  which has been marked by the user as “Deleted”) relating to your behavior on the website, 
  including, but not limited to, creating a campaign, signing a campaign, your general 
  geographic region and/or your organization affiliations (your “Campaign Activity 
  Information”). Please do not post any personal information in any public forum of 
  Change.org which you expect to remain private, including, but not limited to, any 
  Personal Information and/or Campaign Activity Information. We also reserve the right 
  to collect any data about you which is publicly available; this data may be obtained 
  by us or by a 3rd party engaged by us to collect such information. For collection of 
  telephone numbers, please see the final paragraph of Section 3 below.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We do NOT collect sensitive information from our users (including, but not limited, 
      to personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic 
      origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership 
      or information specifying the sex life of the individual); however, a visitor to the

      choose to display on the Company’s website(s).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We make good faith efforts to store all collected data in a secure operating 
      environment that is not available to the public, although we cannot guarantee 
      complete security. All of our collected data resides on servers in the United States.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Our web logs collect standard web log entries for each page served, including 
      your IP address, page URL, and timestamp. Web logs help us to diagnose problems

      our services to you.

  <li>
    <p>
      At any time you may access the data which we have stored about you by contacting

      If any data is incorrect, you will be allowed to make any reasonable correction,

      otherwise required to be retained by law or for any other legitimate business purpose).

  <li>
    <p class="strong">
      How we may use your data
    </p>
    <p>
      We may share your Personal Information with the following third parties:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>
        <p>
          Affiliated third parties (for example, our database administrators) for the sole

  Information or use it for any purpose other than as instructed by us.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you sign a petition, please be advised that, even if you uncheck the box 
      “Display my signature publicly”, your Personal Information may be delivered 
      to the intended recipient of such campaign and/or the creator of such campaign 
      either electronically or in writing; the Company does not in any manner monitor 
      or attempt to verify the intended recipients of any campaign and/or the creator 
      of any campaign and disclaims all liability regarding the accuracy of the 
      intended recipient(s) of all campaigns and/or creator(s) of all campaigns. 
      Please note further that if you choose to display your signature to a petition 
      publicly, you are also consenting to the disclosure of your name, city, state 
      and a link to your change.org user profile on the landing page for such petition, 
      indicating that you have signed such petition; this information will be visible 
      to any visitor of our website, including search engines and other organizations 
      which provide archival internet activities (See Section 4 below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you would like to receive direct communication from the organizations you support, 
      you may choose to have us pass your Personal Information to such organizations; 
      please note that whenever you choose to have us pass such Personal Information to 
      an organization, we will additionally inform the organization of the source 
      campaign where you made this election. Please also be advised that the default 
      settings for many of our campaigns assume that you wish to receive communications 
      from the organizations you support; if you do not wish to receive such communications, 
      please uncheck the box “Keep me updated by [name of organization]” (or other language 
      of a similar nature) before signing such campaign. If you choose to receive direct 
      communications from the organizations you support, please be advised that: (i) 
      Change.org has no control over the content, frequency and/or any other aspect of 
      such communications; and (ii) although we do not sell or trade our contact lists, 
      it is fairly common practice for organizations to rent or trade the names and 
      addresses of their donors with other organizations. Accordingly, we strongly urge 
      you to review the terms of service, privacy policies and/or other like policies of 
      any organization prior to consenting to our transmission of your Personal Information 
      to such organization.
    </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In addition, we may utilize your Campaign Activity Information for internal purposes 
    to help us personalize the experience for each user and to operate, maintain and improve 
    the features and functionality of our website. Please note that if you choose to make 
    some of your Campaign Activity Information public (such as publicly displaying your 
    signature to a petition or making a comment in a public forum), 3rd parties will have 
    access to such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company: (1) may disclose 
    information about its users if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that 
    such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other 
    legal process; and (2) may also disclose information about its users to law enforcement 
    officers or others, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary 
    to: (a) enforce our Terms of Service; (b) respond to claims that any posting or other 
    content violates the rights of third-parties; (c) or protect the rights, property, or 
    personal safety of the Company, its users or the general public.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the event that the Company is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization 
    or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. 
    The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Special notices regarding collection and use of telephone numbers: (1) If you provide your 
    telephone number to the Company, it will be saved in the Company's database. If you are 
    shown a sponsored petition in which telephone numbers are collected, you will be able to 
    elect (solely at your discretion) whether or not you'd like your telephone number transferred 
    to such sponsor (as indicated therein). If applicable, we may also pre-populate the telephone 
    number field for your convenience; and (2) You won't be hearing from Change.org via telephone 
    unless you start a petition and the Company needs to contact you regarding petition issues or 
    to potentially provide support to your campaign.
