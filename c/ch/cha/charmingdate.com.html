						The <a href="http://www.qpidnetwork.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">Qpid Network Privacy Policy</a> describes how we treat personal information when you use Qpid Network subsidiary sites' services ("Services"), including information provided when you use CharmingDate.com. The following describes our privacy practices that are specific to CharmingDate.com.<br><br>
                        Welcome to CharmingDate.com ("CharmingDate" or the "Site"). Your privacy is important to us.

                        Owing to the global nature of CharmingDate's business conducted over the internet, it is practically impossible for us to comply with all applicable laws / rules / regulations (and the like) as may be prescribed by individual country / region / city. We endeavor to adopt internationally recommended “Best Practices” whilst adhering to the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, laws of Hong Kong which you must agree to as the applicable law in case of dispute arising herefrom.<br><br>

In particular, we carry out Privacy Compliance Assessment exercise periodically to ensure compliance in respect of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.<br><br>
