 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 
 <p> 
   At ChatrouletteSites.Com, we are committed to protecting online user  privacy. This "Privacy Policy" discloses the privacy practices  governing our knowing collection, use, and disclosure of information. In order  to ensure your privacy, information we collect is used only in the manner and  for the purposes described below.</p>
   
   <p>
   Anonymous User Information: ChatrouletteSites.Com collects some anonymous information each  time you visit ChatrouletteSites.Com so we can improve the overall quality of your online  experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform  type. You do not have to register with ChatrouletteSites.Com before we can collect this  anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such  as your name, e-mail address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly  provide such information. ChatrouletteSites.Com does not require you to share information  that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order  for you to use the ChatrouletteSites.Com search. ChatrouletteSites.Com assigns an anonymous ID number  to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the  date and time you visited ChatrouletteSites.Com, your search terms, and the links upon  which you choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log  files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We analyze this  information to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in  the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. ChatrouletteSites.Com  may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have  been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of  the ChatrouletteSites.Com search.</p>
  
   <p>
   Cookies: We use a feature of Internet web browsers called a "cookie,"  which is a small file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.  This enables us to store user preferences and track user trends and search  patterns. We use cookies to improve the quality of the ChatrouletteSites.Com services and  to better understand how users interact with us. We do not and cannot use  Cookies to retrieve individual personally identifiable information about you  from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such  information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain information from your  hard drive or pass on a computer virus. You can reset your browser to refuse  all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some ChatrouletteSites.Com  features or services may not function properly without cookies. </p>
   
   <p>
   Aggregated General Information: We may share aggregated general information  about our site with our corporate partners or others. Examples of this include  the number of users who searched for "Classic Cars", the daily number  of unique visitors, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement.  Aggregated data does not contain any personally identifiable information that  could be used to contact or identify you. </p>
   <p>Correspondence:  If you contact ChatrouletteSites.Com, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we  may collect your email address.</p> <br>
   <p>
   Third Party Information Gathering: ChatrouletteSites.Com may include content and ads from  third parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described  herein. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect  data or solicit personal information. For more information about each third  party content provider, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please refer  to such third party advertiser's privacy policy ChatrouletteSites.Com contains links to  other sites on the Web. Please be aware that ChatrouletteSites.Com is not responsible for  the privacy practices of such other sites.
