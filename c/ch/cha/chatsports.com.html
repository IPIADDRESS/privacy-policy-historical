	<h1>Chat Sports, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1><br>
	<p>Chat Sports owns and runs various websites through which it offers various services (the Websites and services are referred to as the "Services").</p>
	<p>A link to this privacy policy is included on the homepage of each of the Websites. Chat Sports respects the privacy of its users. This document explains how Chat Sports will use the information that you provide to us via the Services. Chat Sports may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If Chat Sports does so, the revised Privacy Policy will be posted on the Websites.</p>
	<p><strong>1. Information Collected.</strong> You are not required to provide personally identifiable information to visit the Websites. However, in order to take advantage of certain features you may need to provide some personally identifiable information. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Account Information. To create an account on Chat Sports, we require you to provide your name, email address, age and gender, to create a user name and to provide a password.
		</li>
		<li>
			Aggregate Usage Data and Anonymized Data. Chat Sports may collect usage data based on users. Usage of the site and its various features, but it is not personally identifiable except as described below under the IP Addresses section ("Aggregate Data"). In addition, Chat Sports may take your personal information and create anonymized information by excluding information (such as your user name) that makes it personally identifiable to you ("Anonymized Data"). 
		</li>
		<li>
			Chat Sports Rooms When you use a Chat Sports Room, you are asked to create a screen name and to provide demographic information about yourself, such as age and gender. Chat Sports then creates a cookie that enables Chat Sports to identify you when you visit any Chat Sports Room, even if it is on a different website from the one where you created the screen name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Demographic and Geographic Data. Chat Sports may ask people to voluntarily provide additional demographic information such as age, gender, location, and interests, or we may require it for you to use certain features. We use demographic information to improve our services and to provide you with features like customized advertising. In addition, Chat Sports may receive geographic or demographic information from outside sources. These sources may include companies whom we have engaged in accordance with Section 5 to provide that information based on information that you have provided to us, from our Community IM partners, from the third-party messenger services that you access through Chat Sports, or from other partners such as in connection with a co-branded website or a promotion. Chat Sports may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Websites. 
		</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p><strong>2. Storage, Disclosure and Use of Your Communications.</strong> You can use Chat Sports to chat in private IM sessions and to chat in public sessions through Chat Sports Rooms. Never disclose personal information about yourself in a public area like Chat Sports Rooms or the message boards. Don't share personal information in a private chat unless it's someone you know well in the real world. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are registered as a Chat Sports user and are logged onto Chat Sports, your preferences are automatically set to store your IM history on Chat Sports' servers. You can view or delete your IM history by clicking on the IM history icon in your chat window. You can turn off the IM history feature in your Chat Sports account preferences. Keep in mind that even if you elect not to store your IM history, the person that you're chatting with may be storing your conversation, either on Chat Sports, on their IM networks, servers or on their own computers.

Private chats in Chat Sports Rooms are not stored. Do not disclose personally identifiable information in Chat Sports Rooms or on message boards, as those postings are available to the public and may be saved on our server(s) as publicly available information. </li>
		<li>Chat Sports may disclose saved IM history in legal proceedings or investigations in the same manner as other personally identifiable information as described in Section 5 (g). </li>
		<li>Chat Sports may customize the advertising shown to users based on software analysis of chat or Chat Sports Room conversations. </li>
	</ul><br>
	<p><strong>3. Cookies.

	<p>We and our advertisers may use third-party companies to serve ads when you use the Services. These third-party ad-serving companies may also place cookies on your computer. Sometimes these cookies may be used to provide customized advertising to you on the Websites or on other sites. These advertising companies may also use Web beacons to help manage and optimize our online advertising.</p> 
	<p><strong>4. IP Addresses.</strong> Chat Sports compiles logs of IP addresses of users of the Services for administrative and analytical purposes. Chat Sports does not routinely collect any personally identifiable information through its compilation of IP addresses or the location of computers on the Internet.

		<li>Where we have a good faith belief that it is required in order to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, to prevent fraud or imminent harm, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. </li>
	</ul> 
	<p>In the event that Chat Sports is acquired by or merged with another company or transfers substantially all of its assets to another company, Chat Sports will transfer all of its user information and data, including information about you, to that other company. </p>
	<p><strong>6. Notification of Changes and Other Events.</strong> Any changes to this policy will be posted on the Websites in this location. </p>

	<p><strong>7. Other Sites.</strong> The Services contain links to, and media and other content from, other sites. Such third-party media and content may also contain external links. Because of the dynamic media capabilities of the Services, it may not be clear to you which links are embedded in the Services and which are embedded in third-party media and/or content. In addition, Chat Sports Services may be available on third party websites, whether through embedding or partnership arrangements. Chat Sports cannot and does not guarantee the privacy policies and practices of any third party, including the Developers who provide the Platform Applications or any third party website through which Chat Sports Services are available. Chat Sports does not control, operate or endorse any information, products or services of any third-party websites or services that may be reached through links from the Services, of any Platform Application or of any third party website on which Chat Sports Services are available. The use of any personal information provided to such a third party will be governed by that party's privacy policy. </p>
	<p><strong>8. Non-U.S. Users.</strong> Chat Sports is hosted and operated entirely in the United States and is subject to United States law. Any personal information that you provide to Chat Sports is being provided to Chat Sports solely in the United States and will be hosted on United States servers. You consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States. If you are accessing Chat Sports from outside the United States, please be advised that United States law may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction. </p>
	<p><strong>9. Acceptance.</strong> This privacy policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms and conditions of Chat Sports' Terms of Use, available on the Websites. Use of the Services is subject to your compliance with the Terms of Use, which constitutes a legal agreement between you and Chat Sports. Each time you use the Services you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, which incorporates the privacy policy, and the applicable posted guidelines.
