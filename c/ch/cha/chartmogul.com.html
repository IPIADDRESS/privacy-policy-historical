When you do so, the data required to answer your query will be automatically saved and processed. Your data will not be transferred to third parties unless ChartMogul has a lawful ground to do so..</p> <h2 id="deletion-of-personal-data">Deletion of Personal Data</h2> <p>ChartMogul Ltd only keeps and processes personal data for so long as it is necessary. When the purpose of the data processing has been fulfilled, your personal data will be deleted in accordance with our data retention policy, unless we are legally required to retain it.</p> <h2 id="legal-basis-for-processing-personal-data">Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2> <p>In order to process personal data, a lawful ground must exist. A number of permitted grounds for processing are enumerated in Article 6 of the GDPR.</p> <p>One ground for the processing of personal data is Article 6, Paragraph 1(a) of the GDPR, which is the freely given consent of the data subject to do so. This consent is bound to a particular purpose. A second ground for the processing of personal data is in order to fulfil the requirements of a contract, as specified in Article 6, Paragraph 1(b) of the GDPR. However, this clause must be understood to include the initiation of a commercial relationship with the corresponding data processing. This ground applies to ChartMogul Ltd, in the case that the user uses our contact form or contacts our Success or Sales team using any other means to obtain an non-binding quotation. Article 6, Paragraph 1© of the GDPR permits the processing of personal data where a legal requirement to do so exists. Article 6, paragraph 1(d) permits the processing of personal data in exceptional circumstances, where doing so is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject. This ground is relevant to ChartMogul Ltd’s data processing, where ChartMogul Ltd, or at a ChartMogul Ltd event, may have to provide personal data to emergency services - such as name, contact details or health insurance - in order to prevent or treat an injury or other damage to health. It is also possible that personal data will be processed on the basis of Article 6, paragraph 1(f) of the GDPR. This is the so-called “legitimate interests” ground, which is interpreted with reference to Recital 47 of the GDPR. The GDPR treats this ground in the sense of a “fallback ground”, which only applies where no other previously listed lawful ground for processing does. When this ground is relied upon, an assessment must carefully weigh the legitimate interests of the data subject against the legitimate interests of the data controller.</p> <h2 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h2> <p>You have the following rights concerning your personal data:</p> <ul> <li><p>The right to access your personal data</p></li> <li><p>The right to correct or delete your personal data</p></li> <li><p>The right to restrict processing of your personal data</p></li> <li><p>The right to object to the processing of your personal data</p></li> <li><p>The right to data portability</p></li> <li><p>The right to confirm whether your personal data is being processed or not.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data, you can withdraw this consent at any time. Such a withdrawal of consent will only affect the processing of your data after it is given.</p> <p>Should we continue to process your personal data because we assess our legitimate interests to do so outweigh your legitimate interests (per Article 6, paragraph 1(f) of the GDPR) you may object to this processing. This is only applicable in the case where the processing of personal data is not required in order for us to fulfil a contract with you. To exercise such an objection, we request that you detail the grounds based on which we should no longer process your personal data. We will check the details of your circumstances based on the grounds you provide, and either stop processing your personal data, or detail to you the legal basis on which we continue to process your personal data.</p> <p>Additionally, you always have the right to make a complaint to the relevant authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.</p> <h2 id="how-you-can-exercise-your-rights">How you can exercise your rights</h2> <p>Should you wish to exercise any of these rights, you will need to provide proof of identification that you are the person to whom the data relates. The data you will receive includes data we have related to you, the source of that data, the recipients, or types of recipients to whom the data was transferred, and the purposes for which the data was stored. To exercise these rights, please contact our data protection officer named in the beginning of this document.</p> <p><strong>Updated:</strong> May 25, 2018</p> </div> </div> </section> <aside
