At Electric Vehicles Magazine, your privacy is important to us.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by Electric Vehicles Magazine and its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, “ChargedEVs”).</p>
<p>To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by ChargedEVs.</p>
<p>Residents of the European Union or the United Kingdom should consult the end of this section for additional information that applies to such users, including information on your exercise of certain rights and responsibilities created by the General Data Protection Regulation and equivalent laws of the United Kingdom (“GDPR”).</p>

<p><strong>An overview of the information that ChargedEVs may collect</strong></p>
<p>You are able to take advantage of many ChargedEVs products, services, and websites without providing any information that personally identifies you.&nbsp; We only collect personally-identifying information when you voluntarily submit it to us.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we need personally-identifying information in order to provide you with the products and services that you request.&nbsp; Depending upon the product or service, we may ask you for a variety of personally-identifying information.&nbsp; This might include, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, gender, and birth date.&nbsp; We may also ask for other information about you, such as your credit card information (when you are making a purchase), interests, income, or education level. &nbsp;We consider certain identifying information “sensitive.”&nbsp; This includes your credit card number, income level, or any other information that would normally be considered confidential.</p>
<p>You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information.&nbsp; In that case, you can still access and use many portions of our websites; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of any ChargedEVs website that require your personal information.</p>
<p>ChargedEVs websites may include community features, such as online forums and message boards. Information that is posted in these areas becomes public information and the use that any third party makes of this information is beyond our ability to control.&nbsp; You should exercise caution before disclosing any personally-identifying information in these public venues.&nbsp; If you elect to submit content that includes information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the content can and will be displayed on any website on the Internet.</p>
<p>At some ChargedEVs sites and through certain promotions, you can submit personally-identifying information about other people.&nbsp; For example, you might submit a person’s name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card; or, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient’s name and address.&nbsp; Some ChargedEVs websites also provide referral services to help you inform a friend about our websites, products, or services.&nbsp; The types of personally-identifying information that we collect about other people at pages like these may include the person’s name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number.&nbsp; We will only ask you for the information about your friend that we need in order to do what you request.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we also collect non-personally-identifying information.&nbsp; When you visit a ChargedEVs website, we may collect information such as the type of browser you use, your operating system, your IP address, and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; This information, by itself, does not permit individual identification, meaning that you will remain anonymous.&nbsp; However, if you elect to provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that information may be linked to your IP address.</p>
<p>When you visit our websites, we may send one or more cookies (small, removable data files) to your computer.&nbsp; We use cookies to uniquely identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize your online experience at ChargedEVs websites.&nbsp; For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to a website and present relevant content to you when you visit.&nbsp; Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when cookies are sent, or to refuse all cookies.&nbsp; Some of the features and services of ChargedEVs websites may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled.&nbsp; Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with any personally-identifying information.</p>
<p>On our websites, we may also use tiny graphic images called pixel tags, web beacons, or clear gifs. These tiny images help us to analyze our users’ online behavior and collect other data, such as page views or advertising responses.&nbsp; Pixel tags also allow us to send you e-mail in a format that you can read, and let us know when you have opened an e-mail message from us.&nbsp; Pixel tags may also be used to deliver cookies.&nbsp; Some of our websites also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit. These companies may use non-personally-identifying information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
<p>We work with reputable third parties that provide data tracking and collection technologies in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present or serve the advertisements you may see at ChargedEVs websites;</li>
<li>Deliver and track e-mail communications;</li>
<li>Process purchase orders through e-commerce transactions;</li>
<li>Fulfill print and digital subscription orders; and</li>
<li>Provide marketing leads to third-party organizations (where you have agreed to allow us to do so).</li>
</ul>
<p>These companies may collect information about you on our behalf.&nbsp; We require that these parties agree to process any such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information.</p>
<p>Your use of any information or materials on this website is entirely at your own risk, for which we shall not be liable. It shall be your own responsibility to ensure that any products, services or information available through this website meet your specific requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This website contains material which is owned by or licensed to us. This material includes, but is not limited to, the design, layout, look, appearance and graphics. Reproduction is prohibited other than in accordance with the copyright notice, which forms part of these terms and conditions. Unauthorized use of this website may give rise to a claim for damages and/or be a criminal offense.</p>
<p>From time to time this website may also include links to other websites. These links are provided for your convenience to provide further information. They do not signify that we endorse the website(s). We have no responsibility for the content of the linked website(s).</p>
<p>ChargedEVs websites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties.&nbsp; By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally-identifying information that visitors voluntarily submit to them in order to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion.&nbsp; ChargedEVs has no control over the third-party sponsors’ use of this information.&nbsp; If a third-party sponsor beyond our control will obtain information that you supply us, we will notify you at the time we collect the information from you.&nbsp; For certain promotions, only those who provide us with the requested personally-identifying information will be able to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise participate in the promotion’s activities and offerings.</p>

<p>If you provide us with your e-mail and/or postal address, we may include that address in e-mail and/or postal address lists that we sell, trade, or rent to third parties.&nbsp; These lists will never contain sensitive information.&nbsp; If you do not wish for your e-mail or postal address to be shared with companies not owned by ChargedEVs who want to market products or services to you, you have the opportunity to opt out, as described below.&nbsp; You may also opt out of the receipt of any marketing materials from ChargedEVs as described below.</p>
