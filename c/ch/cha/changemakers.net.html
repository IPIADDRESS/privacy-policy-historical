<p>The privacy of your personal information is important to Changemakers. This notice is provided to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way that your personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") is collected and used at this site.</p>
<p>The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for the Changemakers.net site (the "Site") only. If you are an employee of Changemakers or its affiliate, please note that other internal company policies apply to you related to employee use of company computer systems and networks.</p>
<p>Please note that by using the Site, you signify your agreement to the privacy policy stated here. This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 4, 2005.</p>
<h3>Passive Information Collection; Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a text-only piece of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will normally contain the name of the internet domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. We use cookies to evaluate the general use of the Site. We also use cookies to identify who you are after you log in or register so that we can tailor your personal preferences for a more personalized experience. Cookies also insure that the appearance of our site conforms to your internet browser. You usually can configure your Internet browser to reject cookies. However, if you do so, you might not be able to access certain pages or use important functions on the Site. We reserve the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques related to the use of the Site. In general, we do not link your identity with information that we collect passively. However, in any situation where you log in with your username and password, any or all of the information that is passively collected about your activities on the Site may be linked with your identity, and therefore may become Personal Information about you.</p>
<p>To learn more about cookies and other passive tracking technologies and how they may be used on your computer, please read the help information supplied with your internet browser software.</p>
<h3>Active Information Collection</h3>
<p>In general, when you visit our Site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to provide Personal Information to register, make donations, contact us and conduct other transactions via the Site. The types of Personal Information collected at the Site may include any or all of the following, depending on your activities on the Site: Name, company, occupation, identification number, address, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, and credit/debit card/procurement card information, username, password, online training (requested and received), personal financial details about dealer-applicants and other Personal Information that you actively provide to us via the Website.</p>
<p>We also enable you to submit personally identifiable information about other people. For example, we request that you provide us with such information about friends who may be interested in hearing about Changemakers. The following types of personally identifiable information may be collected about people at these pages include: name and contact information (including email address).</p>
<h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We use and disclose Personal Information to process and complete donations and to provide information about our organization or other issues of interest.</p>
<p>WE WILL NOT SELL ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE THROUGH THE SITE WITHOUT YOUR PRIOR CONSENT. We may use Personal Information that you provide to update you on our activities or to let you know about new projects that we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive this information in the future, please contact us at privacy@changemakers.net.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may share certain Personal Information with other non-profits (including other Changemakers affiliates) to enable them to share information that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share Personal Information with these entities, please contact us at privacy@changemakers.net and we will take reasonable measures to avoid sharing such information in the future. Please note that these other parties are sometimes independent from Changemakers, and if you wish to stop all communications from such parties, you will need to address such issues with them directly. We may share Personal Information with our consultants or service providers who help us operate more efficiently and serve our stakeholders better. We also contract other companies and individuals (collectively "Suppliers") to perform functions on our behalf, including without limitation, fulfilling and processing orders, processing credit card payments, handling shipping and returns, sending communications to you, and providing customer services. [We require the Suppliers to keep your Personal Information confidential and only use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not for any other purpose.] We may disclose Personal Information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request. We also reserve the right to disclose Personal Information to protect the security of the Site, to protect ourselves and our affiliated non-profits against liability, and/or in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of some or all of our operations.</p>
<p>Donations that are made to Changemakers on the Site are processed via a third-party payment gateway. Credit / Debit card details will only be retained by the party providing the payment services and its affiliated bank only until payment for your donation is processed, unless you authorize the information to be stored for future visits. If you later decide that you do not want us to store such information, you may contact us at privacy@changemakers.net and ask us to delete such information. In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, card details may be disclosed for the sole purpose of performing further checks.</p>
<p>The Site is not directed to persons under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, please do not disclose Personal Information on the Site.</p>
<h3>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h3>
<p>If you are a registered user of the Site, you can access and correct certain Personal Information that we collect online and maintain by clicking on "Your Account" and entering your username and password. If any errors in your Personal Information cannot be corrected by accessing "Your Account" or if you have other questions related to updating or changing your account information, please contact us using the contact information below. You may also contact us using the information below to ask us to remove your Personal Information from our records, electronic or otherwise. However, we will need to maintain certain Personal Information about your donations in our records for purposes such as tax notifications and disclosures.</p>
<h3>Use of Anonymous Information</h3>
<p>The Site's web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the website. This information is used to create aggregate statistics, for example, when our website is accessed, the pages which refer visitors to our site, the type of web browsers visitors use and which pages are viewed. These statistics help us understand how the Site is used and provide us with valuable information for improving the Site in the future. The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Site. You can access most of our pages without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Changemakers strives to protect the information visitors submit, but no transmission of data is completely secure. Changemakers will not be liable under any circumstances for damages resulting from use of information collected from you or any other visitors to the Site. When you place orders or access your account information, we usually offer (through payment processing service provider) the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your Internet browser which encrypts the Personal Information you input before it is sent to us and seeks to prevent anyone from reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours. If you are still concerned about making a donation online, please feel free to call a customer service representative at 703-527-8300 and make your donation via phone.</p>
<h3>Usernames and Passwords</h3>
<p>It is your responsibility to safeguard any username or password that you have received in connection with the Site, and to notify us if you ever suspect that the security and confidentiality of such username or password has been compromised in any way. You are solely responsible for any use of this Site via your username and password.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Please note that third parties may also collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites through our site. We do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of these or any other third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their websites. If you are concerned by how third parties collect and use information, please review their privacy practices via their website.</p>
<h3>Changes to Changemakers Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Our privacy practices, like the online medium itself, are subject to change. Changemakers may, in its sole discretion, change this privacy policy at any time to reflect changes in the way we collect and use Personal Information in the future. Please check this policy frequently and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information via the Site. All revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the site via a link from the home page of the site. Your continued use of our site after changes in this privacy policy will mean that you accept such changes.</p>
<h3>Governing Law</h3>
