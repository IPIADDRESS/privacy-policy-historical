<h2>How is this information used?</h2>
<p>The information we gather through use of cookies is used only in the aggregate and not tied to personally identifiable information. For example we may track the number of visitors to a specific area of our Website or determine which of our services are used most frequently. We do this so we can continually work to improve our Website and ensure that we are providing the content and services that our visitors want to see and use.</p>
<p>The information we gather from users who have signed up for a Job Poster account ("Job Poster(s)") allows us to communicate with each Job Poster individually and provide them with the transactional communications necessary for their account. We may additionally use this information to send marketing or other communications unless the Job Poster has opted-out (see below).</p>
<p>The information we gather from users who have signed up for a job seeker account ("Job Seeker(s)") will be used to communicate with each Job Seeker individually and provide them with the transactional communications necessary for their account. We may additionally use this information to send marketing or other communications unless the job seeker has opted-out (see below).&nbsp; Additionally, any information the Job Seeker has included in his or her profile or in a specific job application will be made available to the Job Poster who posted the job in order to help that Job Poster to sort and select candidates to create the best shortlist for the position they are looking to fill. If the job seeker has chosen to make their profile "open", certain aspects of it (resume, experience, education, etc.) will be visible to other Job Posters who may be looking for candidates.</p>
<h2>Do you share my information with anyone?</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share Personal Information with third parties. We will never sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their use without your consent.&nbsp; As a Job Seeker who uses our services, you have given your consent to our sharing your Personal Information with the Job Poster who posted the job you are applying for as well as our third party software service provider whose severs and systems are encrypted to maintain confidentiality and security of data to industry standards and who is contractually bound to protect and maintain your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>CharityVillage also uses a third-party company to manage credit card processing. This company is not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on CharityVillage's behalf and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.</p>
<p>We may also share non-personally identifying information in the aggregate with third parties, such as the media, industry observers, potential customers or partners. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, through our Website.</p>
<p>CharityVillage also partners with a third party software supplier that works with a scientific partner in order to perform the personality assessment offered through some of the CV IQ services. The responses to the personality assessment questions will be provided to the scientific partner in a non-identifiable format in order to permit the scoring of those responses. In other words, as a Job Seeker, none of your personally identifiable information will be provided to, or otherwise associated with your responses to the personality assessment questions provided to the external scientific partner solely for the purpose of permitting scoring of your assessment so there will be no ability for the scientific partner to identify you when scoring the personality assessment. All communications with our scientific partner will be done via a secure interface and no personal details of the Job Seeker will be transmitted with the response or the returned scores.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> </p>
<p><strong>As examples of the above:</strong></p>
<p>i) CharityVillage may from time to time use a Person's Personal Information to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to CharityVillage products and services;</p>
<p>ii) if a Person indicated that he/she was interested in receiving offers or information from CharityVillage&nbsp; or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, CharityVillage&nbsp; may send the Person materials about products and services that CharityVillage&nbsp; feels may be of interest to the Person; and</p>
<p>iii) if a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a CharityVillage&nbsp; website, CharityVillage&nbsp; may, under the rules of the promotion, use the Person's name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion.</p>
<p>Further references to "identified purposes" mean the purposes identified in this Principle 2.</p>
<p>2.2 CharityVillage shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the identified purposes to the Person at or before the time Personal Information is collected. Upon request, persons collecting Personal Information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the Person to a designated person within CharityVillage&nbsp; who shall explain the purposes.</p>
<p>2.3 Unless required by law, CharityVillage&nbsp; shall not use or disclose, for any new purpose, Personal Information that has been collected without first identifying the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the Person.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>The knowledge and consent of a Person are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, except where inappropriate.</p>
<p>3.1 Generally, CharityVillage shall seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information at the same time it collects the information. However, CharityVillage&nbsp; may seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information after it has been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.</p>
<p>3.2 In obtaining consent, CharityVillage shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that a Person is advised of the identified purposes for which Personal Information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the Person.</p>
<p>3.3 CharityVillage&nbsp; will require Individuals to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.</p>
<p>3.4 In determining the appropriate form of consent, CharityVillage shall take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable expectations of the Persons.</p>
<p>3.5 In general, the use of products and services by an Individual, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, constitutes implied consent for CharityVillage to collect, use and disclose Personal Information for all identified purposes.</p>
<p>3.6 An Individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may contact CharityVillage for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.</p>
<p>3.7 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Person. For example, CharityVillage may collect or use Personal Information without knowledge or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the Person and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the Person is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated. </p>
<p>CharityVillage&nbsp; may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.</p>
<p>CharityVillage may also use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual or property is threatened.</p>
<p>CharityVillage may disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise related to the legal or regulatory requirements described herein.</p>
<p>The CharityVillage, its outside suppliers and other third parties to whom we disclose information under this policy may perform activities outside of Canada. As a result, your information may be securely used, stored or accessed in other countries and may be subject to the laws of those countries. For example, information may be disclosed in response to valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts, or law enforcement in these countries.</p>

<p>Personal Information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</p>

<p>9.2 In certain situations, CharityVillage may not be able to provide access to all of the Personal Information that they hold about a Person. For example, CharityVillage may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal Personal Information about a Third Party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another person. Also, CharityVillage may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law, or if the information was collected as part of journalistic activities. If access to Personal Information cannot be provided, CharityVillage shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.</p>
<p>9.3 Upon request, CharityVillage shall provide an account of the use and disclosure of Personal Information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the source of the information.

<p>9.4 In order to safeguard Personal Information, an individual or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit CharityVillage to account for the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information and to authorize access to the individual's file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.</p>
