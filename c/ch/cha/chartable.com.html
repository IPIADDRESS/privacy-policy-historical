Introduction
</p>
<p class="lh-copy">Chartable Holding, Inc. (“Chartable”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. The following policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, and disclosing information that we collect from you or that you provide to us when you visit our website (our “Site”) or use any other products and services made available by us (collectively with the Site, the “Services”).</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. The use of information collected through our Services will be limited to the purposes described under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service (or other relevant customer contracts). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that if you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy for that entity and are representing to us that you have the authority to do so (in which case “you” will refer to that entity). If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Services.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised. We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, email or through other reasonable means. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.</p>

Information We Collect and How We Collect Information
</p>
<p class="lh-copy">This policy sets out what personal data we might collect, how we process and protect that data and the lawful grounds for that processing.  In most cases, the lawful ground will be that the processing: (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business, including to grow and improve our Services, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests (“Legitimate Interests”), (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you (“Contract”), or (iii) we have a legal obligation to carry out the processing (“Legal Obligation”). Where processing is based on your consent (“Consent”), we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.</p>
<p class="lh-copy f4">A.  Information You Provide.</p>

<a name="10">Data Retention</a>
</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We strive to keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements.

If you use our Chartable Dashboard, described in further detail in our Terms of Service, please be advised that we do not delete data that has been included in the pool of data used by our Chartable statistical model. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">You acknowledge that Chartable may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Services, including the maximum storage space that will be allotted on Chartable’s servers on your behalf.
