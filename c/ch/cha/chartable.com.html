Introduction
</p>
<p class="lh-copy">Chartable, Inc. (“Chartable”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. The following policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, and disclosing information that we collect from you or that you provide to us when you visit our website (our “Site”) or use any other products and services made available by us (collectively with the Site, the “Services”).</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. The use of information collected through our Services will be limited to the purposes described under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service (or other relevant customer contracts). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that if you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy for that entity and are representing to us that you have the authority to do so (in which case “you” will refer to that entity). If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Services.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised. We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, email or through other reasonable means. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.</p>
<p class="lh-copy f4">

Information We Collect and How We Collect Information
</p>
<p class="lh-copy">This policy sets out what personal data we might collect, how we process and protect that data and the lawful grounds for that processing.  In most cases, the lawful ground will be that the processing: (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business, including to grow and improve our Services, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests (“Legitimate Interests”), (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you (“Contract”), or (iii) we have a legal obligation to carry out the processing (“Legal Obligation”). Where processing is based on your consent (“Consent”), we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.</p>
<p class="lh-copy f4">A.  Information You Provide.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We may collect information you provide directly via the Services. We may ask you for some or all of the following types of information when you register with our Services, submit comments and other content, order products, or directly contact us with questions or feedback:</p>

<p class="lh-copy">We may also collect certain information automatically when you visit the Services, including:</p>
<ul class="lh-copy">

<li>Other unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers</li>
<li>Sites you visited before and after visiting the Services</li>
<li>Pages you view and links you click on within the Services</li>

<li>Standard Server Log Information</li>
</ul>
<p class="lh-copy">We collect the above information in a variety of ways, including by using “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, and “cookies.”</p>

You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Services.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.</p>
<p class="lh-copy f4">
<a name="3">Third-Party Information Collection</a>
</p>
<p class="lh-copy">We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information through the Services.  For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics.</p>
<p class="lh-copy">The information collected and stored by third parties remains subject to their policies and practices. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
