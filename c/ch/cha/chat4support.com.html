                                    We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
                                    information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store

                                    the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
                                    For the confidentiality, Chat4Support will not sell, rent, swap, or otherwise disclose

                                    is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information
                                    with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose

                                    from subsequent users.
