		information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer 
		service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and

						<h2><font face="Arial">What information we collect and 
						how we may use it</font></h2>
						<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">There are a number of situations 
						in which your personal information may help us give you 
						better products. For example:</font></p>
						<ul class="square">
							<li style="margin-bottom: 18px"><font face="Arial">
							We may ask for your personal information when you’re 
							discussing a service issue on the phone with an 
							associate, downloading a software update, 
							registering for a seminar, participating in an 
							online survey, registering your products, or 
							purchasing a product. </font></li>
							<li style="margin-bottom: 18px"><font face="Arial">
							When you interact with Chat To Text, we may collect 
							personal information relevant to the situation, such 
							as your name, mailing address, phone number, email 
							address, and contact preferences; your credit card 
							information and information about the&nbsp; Chat To 
							Text services you use.</font></li>
							<li style="margin-bottom: 18px"><font face="Arial">
							We also collect information for market research 
							purposes — such as your occupation and age — to gain 
							a better understanding of our customers and thus 
							provide more valuable service. </font></li>
							<li style="margin-bottom: 18px"><font face="Arial">
							We collect information regarding customer activities 
							on our websites, ChatToText.com. This helps us to 
							determine how best to provide useful information to 
							customers and to understand which parts of our 
							websites, products, and Internet services are of 
							most interest to them. </font></li>
							<li style="margin-bottom: 18px"><font face="Arial">
							We may use personal information to provide products 
							that you have requested as well as for auditing, 
							research, and analysis to improve Chat To Text’s 
							products. </font></li>

    <h2><font face="Arial">Who Has Access to It</font></h2>
    <p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">Only people within Chat To Text who need to access your personal information can access it.
	</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial">How We Share It</font></h2>
   <p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">We do not sell or provide your personal information to any third parties.</font></p>
    <p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">We might share your personal information under the following circumstances:<br>
&nbsp;</font></p><ul>
		<li>
		<font face="Arial">We have your consent.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">We are required to share customer information by law, to protect the interests of the company or in the discharge of public duty.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">We need to share your personal information with a business partner in order to provide a service you have requested. Our business partner's use of your information is restricted to the delivery of the service you have requested. 
			</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">How You Change or Remove It</font></h2>
		<p><font face="Arial">You have access to your personal information that we retain. We try to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. If you'd like to change or remove your personal information, please 
		log into your account.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Changes to this Statement</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">We may amend this privacy and security statement from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement.</font></p>
	<h2><font face="Arial">Security</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial"><span class="blackbold">We use current security measures to safeguard your personal information.</span>
		    </font>
		    </p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial">All the personal information you provide us is stored in a secure computing environment protected by secure firewalls to prevent 
		<br>unauthorized access.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">We control access so that only people who need to access the information can. All staff of 
			Chat To Text are required to adhere to a security
agreement.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">When you use secure areas of the site, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol with 128-bit encryption. This means that all the
information sent between your computer and our secure computer environment is encrypted or scrambled so that no one can read it in 
transit. You can read it and we can read it-no one else. There are two cues to show you that you are using a secure area. First, the Web 
site address (or URL) appears as https:// (instead of just http://)-the "s" is for "secure." Second, a lock or key indicator appears in the status 
bar of your Web browser.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">Secure areas of the site have a time-out feature. If you leave your secure session inactive for some time, it times-out to prevent 
		<br>unauthorized access.	        </font></li>
	</ul>
		<p></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Credit Cards</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">We do accept credit card payments for registrations. If someone uses your credit card to make an unauthorized purchase, check with the 
		  institution that issued your card to find out what the exact liability is.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Email</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">If you send us an email, we may save it if we think we'll need it to communicate with you. We never sell or share email addresses. Remember, 
		  email is not a secure way to send personal information because it is not encrypted. Please don't send any personal information to us using email; 
		  use our secure forms instead.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Cookies</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">Our Web site stores information in a small text file, called a cookie, on your computer. We use what is called a "persistent cookie," which is 
		  stored as a file on your computer and remains there when you close your Web browser. The cookie can only be read by the Web site that 
		  created it when you visit that site again.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Our Use of Cookies</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">Chat To Text stores a unique number (not any personal information) in the cookie that we place on your computer. We use this cookie to determine
		  if you have visited the site before, and to ensure you are only prompted once to fill in certain forms such as our 
		account login information. The
		  information we store in the cookie does not include data such as your name, company, email address, telephone number, state/province, country 
		  or the industry you work in.</font></p>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">Note: If you do not allow cookies to be saved on your computer, 
		functionality of the site might be limited.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial">Security Concerns</font></h2>
		<p class="blackbold"><font face="Arial">Once the cookie is saved on your computer, our Web 
		site is the only site that can access and read the information that you 
		provide. Chat To Text
	    will not provide this information to any third parties or use it for sending unsolicited email.<br>
