          ,” “we,” “us”) shares your concerns about 
          the protection of your personal information online. This Privacy Policy 
          (“Policy”) describes our practices regarding the collection 
          and use of information through our website, located at www.redenvelope.com 
          (the “Site”). By using the Site or obtaining any product 
          or service through this Site, you agree the collection of use of information 
          as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please 
          do not use the Site. <br>
          <br>
          We may from time to time update this Policy. We will notify you of changes 
          to the Policy by posting the updated Policy on this page. We ask that 
          you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing 
          familiarity with the most current version of the Policy. You can determine

        <p align="left" class="charitybuzztext">First, we collect non-personally

          and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages 
          of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which 
          links were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves 
          logging the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used 
          by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally 
          identifiable, it may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s 
          Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s 
          point of connectivity.</p>
        <p align="left" class="charitybuzztext">We also use “cookies” 
          and other tracking technologies to collect non-personally identifiable

          we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. 
          Cookies make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit 
          our Site. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save
