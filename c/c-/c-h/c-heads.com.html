functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p><p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR”), “processing” refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p><p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p><p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p><p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br> II. The rights of users and data subjects<br> III. Information about the data processing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Information about us as controllers of your data</h3><p>The party responsible for this website (the “controller”) for purposes of data protection law is:</p><p>Christine Guggenberger<br> Spitalmühlgasse 6<br> 2340 Mödling<br> Austria</p><p>Telephone: upon request<br> Email: contact@c-heads.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Use of Google Analytics<em><br> </em></h3><p>Based on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO), Google Analytics uses a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (“Google”). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p><p>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a>).</p><p>Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.</p><p>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.</p><p>The IP address submitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; Users may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to its use of the online offer and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p><p>The personal data of users will be deleted or anonymized after 12 months.</p><p>Here’s more information on Google Inc’s data usage: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Use of Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Instagram plugins</h3><p><em>Use of Facebook social plugins</em></p><p>This website uses social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are recognizable by one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on a blue tile or a “thumbs up” sign) or are marked with the addition “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.</p><p>When a user calls a web page of this site that contains such a plugin, its browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and incorporated by him into the website. The provider therefore has no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore informs users according to their level of knowledge:</p><p>By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example, press the “Like” button or leave a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored there.</p><p>If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and options for protecting the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>. If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him through this offer and associate it with his member data stored on Facebook, he must “Log out” on Facebook befire visiting the site.</p><p>It is also possible to block Facebook social plugins with add-ons for your browser, for example with the “<a href="http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Blocker</a>“.</p><p><em>Google+</em></p><p>Google+ is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). For an overview of Google’s plugins and their look, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers.google.com/+/web/</a></p><p><em>Twitter</em></p><p>This site uses the buttons of the Twitter service. These buttons are provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. They are recognizable by terms such as “Twitter” or “Follow”, associated with a&nbsp; blue bird. With the help of the buttons it is possible to share a post or page of this site on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.</p><p>When a user calls up a web page of this web site containing such a button, its browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of Twitter. The content of the Twitter buttons is transmitted by Twitter directly to the user’s browser. The provider therefore has no influence on the extent of the data that Twitter collects with the help of this plugin and informs users according to their level of knowledge. After this, only the IP address of the user, the URL of each web page when the button is received, but not used for purposes other than the appearance of the button.<br> Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://twitter.com/privacy</a>.</p><p><em>Instagram</em></p><p>Instagram is operated by Instagram L LC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“Instagram”). An overview of the Instagram buttons and their appearance can be found here:<br> <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/%20post/36222022872/introducing%20-%20instagram%20-%20badges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://blog.instagram.com/%20post/36222022872/introducing%20-%20instagram%20-%20badges</a><br> Instagram Privacy Policy <a href="https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help.instagram.com/155833707900388/</a></p><p>If you do not want Google, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to directly associate the data collected via our website with your profile in the respective service, you must log out of the relevant service before visiting our website. You can completely prevent the loading of plugins with add – ons for your browser, eg. With the script blocker “NoScript” (<a href="http://noscript.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://noscript.net/</a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>a) Session cookies<br> We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address.</p><p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p><p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p><p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p><p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p><p>b) Third-party cookies<br> If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p><p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p><p>c) Disabling cookies<br> You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p><p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Youtube</h3><p>This website uses the Privacy Plugin from Lyte. The Youtube videos are cached with a preview image not by YouTube servers but by the own server. That means, it will not connect to any YouTube servers before you click and confirm the play button. This allows embedding YouTube videos without sending data to Google/youtube with every page view. This plugin only connects to Youtube when the user actively clicks the play button. More information can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/michaelzangl/wp-video-embed-privacy/wiki/How-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/michaelzangl/wp-video-embed-privacy/wiki/How-it-works</a></p><p>Starting the video could trigger further data processing. We have no influence on that. For more information about privacy at YouTube, please see their privacy policy at: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube</a></p><h3> SoundCloud</h3><p>On our pages Soundcloud can be embedded – a service of social network SoundCloud (SoundCloud Limited, Berners House, 47-48 Berners Street, London W1T 3NF, United Kingdom.). When you visit our page, after activating the Play button, a direct connection is established between your browser and the SoundCloud server. SoundCloud receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the “Like” or “Share” button while logged into your SoundCloud account, you may link and / or share the contents of our pages with your SoundCloud profile. This allows SoundCloud to associate your account with our pages. We point out that we as the provider of the pages are not aware of the content of the transmitted data and their use by SoundCloud. For more information, see the SoundCloud Privacy Statement at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy</a></p><p>If you do not want Soundcloud to associate the visit to our pages with your SoundCloud user account, please log out of your SoundCloud user account before enabling content from the SoundCloud plugin.</p><h3> Vimeo</h3><p>We use components of the supplier Vimeo on our site. Vimeo is a service of Vimeo LCC, 555 West 18th Street, NY, New York 10011, USA. Each time you visit our website, which has such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Vimeo. When you visit our site and you are logged in to Vimeo, Vimeo recognizes, through the information gathered by the component, which specific site you are visiting and assigns this information to your personal account with Vimeo. Click e.g. If you click on the “Play” button or leave a comment, this information will be transmitted to your personal user account at Vimeo and stored there.

The stories of the people behind the art
#8&nbsp; @demislw  A Duality Of Scale  No matter what field an artist works in, there’s one thing that binds us all: that strange duality of money versus passion. We’re all on that spectrum somewhere, everything we do. Are you that person who’s almost completely sold their artistic soul, lingering at the money end? Or perhaps you’re the other, struggling to pay the bills, sharing a room with several half-finished projects, loving every second of the starvation? Me? I might have found that particular balance, albeit an uncommon one.  Half my year I spend working on Hollywood films. Visual effects: compositing, if you want to get specific. It’s very creative work – that ‘photoshop for video’ kind of skillset, involving green-screens, with an artistic scope ranging from removing pimples from brows up to creating and destroying entire worlds. It’s fun. It’s challenging. And yes, it pays the bills. My bosses bosses are big corporate entities, Disney and the like, with much of the higher level structural creativity well out of my hands. Some months, some deadlines, my body is destroyed by the 18-hour-days or the 7-day-weeks. More often than not, even that becomes worth it: working on a single successful film, and I’ve got something cool to talk about at the pub for years.  Then, with the other half of my year, something that feels like an opposite: I take photographs. Fashion, portraits, friends, models, the occasional celeb/actor type. Instead of vast teams working from open-plan corporate office booths, it’s me, a model, a makeup artist, maybe a stylist. Instead of seven different levels of creative command between me and the finished pixels on screen, it’s just us few, in the room, making art on the fly.... &quot;  Photography and words @demislw
