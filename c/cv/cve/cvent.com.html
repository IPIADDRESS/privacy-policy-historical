	<p class="clearer">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Cvent, Inc. ("Cvent") respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its  customers, shareholders, employees, vendors, users and business partners. Not  only does Cvent strive to collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information (Personal Information) in a manner consistent with the laws of the  countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding  the highest ethical standards in its business practices.</p>
    <p>Cvent complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Cvent has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Cvent’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
	<p> This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that Cvent follows with respect to collection, usage and transfer of Personal Information anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Union (EU) to the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING THE CONTENT AND SERVICES PROVIDED ON THE CVENT WEBSITE OR OTHERWISE USING THE WEBSITE, USERS CONSENT TO CVENT’S COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION RECEIVED BY CVENT (WHICH MAY INCLUDE PERSONAL INFORMATION) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. <strong>USER’S MAY AT ANY TIME CHOOSE TO RESTRICT OR BLOCK THE SITE’S USE OF COOKIES IN THEIR WEB BROWSER.</strong> INFORMATION ABOUT THE USE OF COOKIES BY CVENT’S WEBSITE (AND USERS’ CHOICE TO TURN OFF COOKIES) IS PROVIDED <a href="#cookies">HERE</a>.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<p>For  purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
	<p>"Cvent"  means Cvent, Inc. its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups.</p>
	<p>“Personal  Information” means any set of information that identifies or could be used to  identify an individual. Personal Information does not include information that  is encoded or publicly available information not combined with private Personal  Information.</p>
	<p>“User”  means any user of the Cvent application, including Cvent customers and their  guests who may register or respond to Cvent Events, Surveys or Requests For  Proposals (RFPs). “Planner(s)” will refer to Cvent’s customer(s), solely.</p>
<h2>Our Service</h2>
	<p>Cvent licenses three (3) software product solutions referred to as: (i) the  Supplier Network (ii) Event Product, and (iii) Survey Product. These solutions may also be referenced in this Privacy Policy and other collateral as System, Tool, Product, Service, Solution, Application and other derivations thereof. Cvent users are subject to the terms only for the product solution they use or  purchase.</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
	<p>Cvent will not disclose or share Personal Information collected on its web  site with any third party, except as required by law and/or pursuant to a governmental request, or as necessary to provide services to support its  software solutions. For example, Cvent may pass Personal Information to Cvent  business partners necessary to process online/ecommerce payments and travel  related reservations. Cvent never has, and never will, use information  collected by it’s customers via the Cvent system for any purposes other than  those specifically designated by its customers.</p>
	<p>Aggregate Data. Cvent may share reports with third parties based on  aggregated data of it’s users ("Aggregated User Data"). Aggregated User Data does not include any  Personal Information about users and is aggregated for the purposes of determining successful application benchmarks and other similar activities.</p>
	<p>Event Registration. Cvent customers may invite guests to register for events created in the Cvent application. If a user/guest chooses to register  for an event and provides Personal Information during registration, that  information is transferred to the event Planner and event Planner’s  organization. Similarly, survey  responses submitted will be presented to Planner after submission. Any information collected by Cvent on behalf of a customer is owned in its entirety  by the customer. Cvent is not responsible for the privacy practices of its customers.</p>
	<p>Special Circumstances. Cvent may disclose Personal Information when it has  reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify,  contact or bring legal action against someone who is violating Cvent’s <a href="http://www.cvent.com/en/terms-of-use.shtml">Terms of Use</a> or may be causing injury to or interference with other Cvent users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
	<p>IP Addresses. Cvent may use user IP addresses to diagnose problems with  Cvent servers and to administer the Cvent application.</p>
<a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a><h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>Definition. A cookie is a small data file placed in a user’s web browser or written to a user’s hard drive when a website is accessed.  A “session” cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser. A “persistent” cookie remains on the user’s device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted. A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user’s hard drive. Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user’s individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and website users who log in to their Cvent accounts may be individually identifiable to particular Cvent applications using session cookies. </p>
	<p>Use. Cvent uses cookies to improve user experience, monitor website usage and gather information which helps Cvent improve the site content and applications. For example, cookies are used to distinguish between and authenticate users, save usernames and login status (so that users don’t have to log in more than once each time they access secured portions of the site), keep track of user-specific settings such as language, layout and other preferences, and manage session information to minimize data entry and for general ease of use. Cookies are also used to "time-out" user sessions that are idle for an extended period of time. Cvent may also use cookies to gather statistical and other information about how the website is used, assess the effectiveness of advertising, monitor access and use of particular content and provide tailored advertising and other content to users. Using cookies in the foregoing manner makes the website more effective, easier to use, improves security and efficiency, and is essential for the continuous improvement of Cvent’s systems. Consequently, accepting these cookies is necessary for many uses of the website and blocking or restricting cookies may limit a user’s ability to access certain website content and functionality.</p>
	<p>Blocking/Restricting Cookies. Users may set their web browsers to restrict or to entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this should be provided in the web browser’s help/reference section. Users who block cookies may be able to access the Cvent website but will not be able to use most of the content, applications and services Cvent makes available on the website. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a user from using certain portions of the Cvent website, depending on how the browser settings are configured. For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in a user’s web browser.</p>
<h2>Choice</h2>
	<p>Cvent users may choose  whether or not to submit Personal Information while using Cvent’s services. In some cases, Cvent’s customers require Personal Information from their guests. In such cases, choosing to withhold Personal Information, may limit a user’s ability to use all of Cvent’s services.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>Cvent has security measures in place to protect  against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under its control. Cvent  protects secure data with industry-standard firewall and password protection  systems. Cvent periodically reviews and improves its security and privacy  policies as necessary. Only pre-authorized individuals have access to Cvent  servers and information provided by its users.</p>
	<h2>Data Integrity</h2>
	<p>Cvent will use Personal Information only in ways  that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that Personal Information is  relevant accurate, complete and current, to its intended use.</p>
	<h2>Access and  Correction</h2>
	<p>Cvent users may change or modify previously  submitted Personal Information by (i) using the User Profile Manager within the "My Account" section of the Cvent application or (ii) sending an email request to <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com</a>.</p>
	<p>Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is infallible. Any information transmitted through the Cvent application is done at the user’s own risk. Once Cvent receives the information, it will take every reasonable precaution to ensure its security.</p>
	<h2>Enforcement</h2>
	<p>Cvent will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy and the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles. Any employee that Cvent determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.</p>
	<h2>Supplier Network</h2>
	<p>When a Cvent user submits an RFP to a property or service provider listed on the Supplier Network, Cvent will contact the applicable supplier and disclose information necessary to submit the RFP, which may contain Personal Information. Cvent suppliers will not have access to the Cvent user's address book or information collected through the Cvent Event or Survey Products.</p>
	<h2>Web Site Links</h2>
	<p>Cvent contains links to other web sites. Cvent is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these web sites.</p>
	<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
	<p>As this Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, please check back periodically to review any changes. The last modified date will be provided at the bottom of the page.</p>
