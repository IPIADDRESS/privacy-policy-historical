	<p>Cvent, Inc. (sometimes referred to as "Cvent") respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its  customers, shareholders, employees, vendors, users and business partners. Not  only does Cvent strive to collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information (Personal Information) in a manner consistent with the laws of the  countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding  the highest ethical standards in its business practices. Cvent abides by the Safe Harbor Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European  Commission.</p>
	<p> This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that Cvent follows with respect to collection, usage and transfer of Personal Information anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Union (EU) to the United States.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<p>For  purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
	<p>"Cvent"  means Cvent, Inc. its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups.</p>
	<p>“Personal  Information” means any set of information that identifies or could be used to  identify an individual. Personal Information does not include information that  is encoded or publicly available information not combined with private Personal  Information.</p>
	<p>“User”  means any user of the Cvent application, including Cvent customers and their  guests who may register or respond to Cvent Events, Surveys or Requests For  Proposals (RFPs). “Planner(s)” will refer to Cvent’s customer(s), solely.</p>
<h3>Our Service</h3>
	<p>Cvent licenses three (3) software product solutions referred to as: (i) the  Supplier Network (ii) Event Product, and (iii) Survey Product. These solutions may also be referenced in this Privacy Policy and other collateral as System, Tool, Product, Service, Solution, Application and other derivations thereof. Cvent users are subject to the terms only for the product solution they use or  purchase.</p>
<h4>Notice</h4>
	<p>Cvent will not disclose or share Personal Information collected on its web  site with any third party, except as required by law and/or pursuant to a governmental request, or as necessary to provide services to support its  software solutions. For example, Cvent may pass Personal Information to Cvent  business partners necessary to process online/ecommerce payments and travel  related reservations. Cvent never has, and never will, use information  collected by it’s customers via the Cvent system for any purposes other than  those specifically designated by its customers.</p>
	<p>Aggregate Data. Cvent may share reports with third parties based on  aggregated data of it’s users ("Aggregated User Data"). Aggregated User Data does not include any  Personal Information about users and is aggregated for the purposes of determining successful application benchmarks and other similar activities.</p>
	<p>Event Registration. Cvent customers may invite guests to register for events created in the Cvent application. If a user/guest chooses to register  for an event and provides Personal Information during registration, that  information is transferred to the event Planner and event Planner’s  organization. Similarly, survey  responses submitted will be presented to Planner after submission. Any information collected by Cvent on behalf of a customer is owned in its entirety  by the customer. Cvent is not responsible for the privacy practices of its customers.</p>
	<p>Special Circumstances.

<h5>Choice</h5>
	<p>Cvent users may choose  whether or not to submit Personal Information while using Cvent’s services. In some cases, Cvent’s customers require Pesonal Information from their guests. In such cases, choosing to withhold PersonalInformation, may limit a user’s ability to use all of Cvent’s services.</p>

	<p class="header">Access and  Correction</p>
