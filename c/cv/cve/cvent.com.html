For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your account for our Services, certain Personal Information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. </li></ul>
    
    <h2>Information You Provide to Us.</h2>
    <p>The information we collect through our Services may include:</p>

We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, on the Services.</p>
    <p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>We may also use your information to contact you via email about products and services that may be of interest to you.  Where required, we will seek and obtain your express authorization before we send you marketing emails.  If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please adjust your email preferences on the profile page that is accessible by clicking the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of emails you receive from us.  For more information, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.  </p>
    
    
    <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. </p>
    <p>If you choose to use our Services to transact business with Cvent customers (for example, purchase a ticket, register for an event, respond to an online survey, or download a mobile application), any information you provide in connection with that transaction will be transferred to, and under the control of, the customer.  Customers will also have access to information (such as App usage data) related to how you interact with the Services that they use to organize and manage meetings and events.  Although our own use and disclosure of your information will be in compliance with this Privacy Policy, Cvent cannot and does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of its customers.</p>
    <p>We may disclose Personal Information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>To our subsidiaries and affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  Cvent, Inc., is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used Personal Information.  </li>
    <li>To contractors, service providers and other third parties as reasonably necessary or prudent to provide, maintain and support our Services.</li>
    <li>To a third party in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Cvent’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by Cvent about our users, customers and prospective customers is among the assets transferred.</li>
    
    <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. Here are some examples:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>If you provide your email address when registering for an event or purchasing a concert ticket, we will use the e-mail address to send you information and announcements relating to that event or concert.</li>
    <li>If you use our Services to pay for event registration fees, tickets or other products and services using your credit card, we will pass your credit card information to payment card processors to validate your payment information and complete the transaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>To provide you with optional newsletters (CrowdTorch):  When you complete a ticket purchase for a live show, you will be automatically enrolled in the CrowdTorch newsletter, where permitted by law.  In addition, for some shows you may receive a complimentary subscription to a trade magazine, venue's newsletter, or an artist's newsletter, where permitted by law.  For this purpose, in each instance, we will provide your name and mailing address to the magazine subscription fulfillment company.  You may choose to simultaneously opt out of the subscriptions during the checkout process.  </li>
    <li>To enable processing of RFPs:  When a Cvent user submits a request for proposal (“RFP”) to a meeting space provider listed on the Cvent Supplier Network, Cvent will contact that venue or its management company and disclose information necessary for it to respond to the RFP, which may contain Personal Information.  </li>
    <li>To your friends associated with your social media account, to other website users and to your social media account provider, in connection with your social sharing activity, such as if you connect your social media account to your Services account or log into your Services account from your social media account.  Cvent will not post responses or other content on your behalf under your social media account, nor will we transfer your Personal Information in our possession to your social media account except as reasonably necessary for social sharing.  However, you agree that by connecting your social media account to your Services account you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.  If you do not want your Personal Information shared with other users or with your social media account provider, please do not connect your social media account with your Services account and do not participate in social sharing on the Services.  </li>
    <li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate:  (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to carry out our obligations and enforce our terms and conditions applicable to the Services and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, our customers, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations where reasonably necessary for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
    <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information or with your consent.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third Party Services</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any non-customer third party operating any site or service to which the Services link.  The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.</p>
    <p>Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other non-customer organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, BlackBerry, or any other company, including app developers, app providers, social media platform providers, operating system providers, wireless service providers or device manufacturers, including any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps.</p>
    <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our service providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services.  As you navigate through and interact with our Services, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Details of your visits to our Services, such as the date and time you access our Services, length of time you spend on our Services, websites you visited before or after our Services, the resources and content that you access and use on the Services, and whether your interaction with our Services results in your requesting information about Cvent or making a purchase.</li>
    <li>Information about your computer and internet connection, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong>  A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.  You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access or receive certain parts of our Services.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Websites or receive our Services.  For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.com/">www.allaboutcookies.com.</a> </li>
    <li><strong>Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies.</strong>  A “session” cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser.  A “persistent” cookie remains on the user’s device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted.  A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user’s hard drive.  Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user’s individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and end users of our Services who log in to their Cvent accounts may be individually identifiable to particular Services using session cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong>  Certain features of our Services may use local storage, such as “Flash cookies” to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Websites.  Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.  For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong>  Pages on our Websites and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs).  Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email.  Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users -- for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).  This enables Cvent to provide a Website experience more tailored to your preferences and interests.</li>
    <p>At this time we do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.  You can learn about how you can adjust your browser’s settings to limit or disable cookies and other tracking technologies by visiting the section below titled “Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information.”</p>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>When you access and use the Services and other websites, we may serve you advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you (or in some cases, to users who our service providers deem to have characteristics similar to our customers) based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites.  To do so, we or our service providers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (alone or in conjunction with web beacons, pixel tags or other tracking technologies).  If you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with these practices, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>.  </p>
    <p>We use Facebook Custom Audiences to deliver advertisements to our customers on Facebook based on email addresses that we have collected.  You may learn more about Facebook Custom Audiences by visiting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/381385302004628/">https://www.facebook.com/help/381385302004628/</a>, and you may learn how to opt-out of receiving advertisements from Cvent based on your email address by visiting the section below titled “Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.”  We also may use information associated with your social media accounts, such as demographic and other information about your title, industry or organization, to improve our marketing efforts if you connect those accounts to your Services account.</p>
    <p>We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements from our customers to their target audience of users.  As one example, meeting space providers may purchase advertisements which are presented selectively through the Cvent Supplier Network to meeting planners who have previously awarded a minimum volume of meetings business to that provider or to competing venues in the target metropolitan area.  Even though we do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.</p>
    <p>We use third party analytics providers, including Quantcast, Google, Adobe, Mixpanel, Mouseflow and others, to collect information about your use of the Services and enable us to improve how the Services work.  The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Services, helps us record any difficulties you have with the Services, shows us whether our advertising is effective or not, and allows us to use responses to advertisements to optimize ad performance.  Google Analytics, Adobe and Mixpanel use cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about the Services use and to report website trends to us, without identifying individual visitors to us.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, and opt-out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.  You may opt-out of Adobe’s data aggregation and analysis about your use of the Services by clicking on this link: <a href="http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&amp;popup=1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;second=1&amp;second_has_cookie=0">http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&amp;popup=1&amp;locale=en_US&amp;second=1&amp;second_has_cookie=0</a>.  Finally, you can opt-out of Mixpanel’s practices by visiting <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout/">https://mixpanel.com/optout/</a>.  In addition, Mouseflow collects information related to mouse clicks, mouse movements, scroll behavior, and/or keystroke activity, but it does not collect personally identifiable information on our behalf or track users’ browsing habits across other websites that do not use Mouseflow.  You can learn more about Mouseflow’s practices by visiting <a href="http://mouseflow.com/privacy">http://mouseflow.com/privacy</a>.</p>
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</h2>
    <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us.  We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tracking Technologies and Advertising.</strong>  You may set your web browser to restrict or to entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this should be provided in the web browser’s help/reference section.  Users who block cookies may be able to access a Website but will not be able to use most of the content, applications and services available on that site.  Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may also prevent a user from using certain portions of the Services, depending on how the browser settings are configured.  For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in a user’s web browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotional Offers from Cvent.</strong>  If you do not wish for Cvent to use your email address to send you promotional messages, or would like us to prevent a Cvent customer from using the Services to send you emails to promote its own or third parties’ products or services, you can (i) opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data (or, in some jurisdictions, by failing to opt-in), (ii) adjust your email preferences on the profile page which is accessible by clicking the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of emails you receive from us (or from our customer), or (iii) at any other time by sending an email stating your request to <a href="mailto:abuse@cvent.com">abuse@cvent.com</a>. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.  Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSO”) and other similar technologies.</strong> We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel available at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>.  You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel, available at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html</a>, and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.</li>

    <p>If you are a registered user of one of our Services, you can review and change your Personal Information and email marketing preferences by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page.  For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Users of our Event Management application may update or correct their Personal Information, other profile settings and user preferences by using the User Profile Manager within the “My Account” section of the App.</li>
    <li>Users of CrowdCompass mobile applications can update or correct their Personal Information or other profile information, using the Online Event Guide or within the native mobile application.  Users who have opted to join an event attendee list (visible to other users of the mobile application for that event) have the option to later hide themselves from the list if desired.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>You may also send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com</a> to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Information that you have provided to us.  In your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information that you have provided to us suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information that you have provided to us.  For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.  We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.  We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
    
    <p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).  There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed. </p>
