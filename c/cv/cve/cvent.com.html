<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="pdf"><img src="http://www.cvent.com/images/adobe-acrobat.gif" alt="Download Adobe PDF" width="10" height="10"> (<a href="http://www.cvent.com/pdf/privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank">Downloadable PDF</a>)</p>
<p>Cvent, Inc. (sometimes referred to as "Cvent," "we," "us," or "our") takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy discloses our information collection and dissemination practices.</p>
<h2>Our Service </h2>
<p>Cvent provides visitors to our web site with access to powerful event planning, registration, and event marketing tools. Event planners ("Planners") use our tools to create an online marketing campaign for an event and to register invitees ("Invitees") (Planners and Invitees, collectively "Members").</p>
<h2>Privacy Protections and Use of Information</h2>
<p>We will not disclose or share personally identifiable information collected on our web site with any third party (except as required by law or pursuant to a governmental request). Cvent never has, and never will, use information collected by our customers via the Cvent system for any purposes other than those specifically designated by our customers themselves.</p>
<p>Aggregate Data. We may share reports with third parties based on aggregated data of our Members ("Aggregated Member Data"). Aggregated Member Data does not include any personally identifiable information about Planners or Invitees. For example, these reports will not include your personal or organization name. Information about Members is aggregated for the purposes of determining successful event benchmarks and other similar activities. </p>
<p>Event Registration. When you register for an event on our site, you have granted us permission to release the information you entered as an Invitee to the Planner. </p>
<p>Special Circumstances. We may disclose personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who is violating our <a href="/assets/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> or may be causing injury to or interference with other Cvent users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. </p>
<p>Cookies. A cookie is a small data file that some web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie may contain information like a user ID that allows the site to track which web pages you have visited. The only personal information a cookie contains is information you decide to supply. A cookie cannot read data from your hard drive or cookie files created by other web sites. We use cookies to save your username so you do not have to retype each time; and to "time-out" your session if it is idle for a long period of time.</p>
<p>IP Addresses. We may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and administer our web site. </p>
<h2>eCommerce </h2>
<p>If you are registering for a paid event as an Invitee, we may request payment information to conclude the transaction as well as your mailing address or other contact information to ensure authentication and proper delivery. We use industry-standard secure socket layer (<acronym title="">SSL</acronym>) encryption. We do not sell or rent your personal financial information.</p>
<p>When you engage in an eCommerce transaction on our site using a credit card, your credit card information, including the number and expiration date and your billing addresses, is passed onto the merchant with whom the transaction was placed; only Cvent and the merchant with whom you placed the order has access to your credit card information. Your credit card information is stored with each order in the Cvent system just long enough to fully process your transaction. After the transaction has completed, your credit card information is removed from our system for security reasons.</p>
<p>You can decline to provide credit card information and any other information at our site at anytime. If you should choose to withhold requested information; however, we may not be able to provide you with the full spectrum of our services. </p>
<h2>Web Site Links </h2>
<p>Our site contains links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these web sites. </p>
<h2>Security Procedures</h2>
<p>This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. We protect secure data with industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. We periodically review and improve our security and privacy policies as necessary. We only allow pre-authorized individuals access to our servers and to information provided by our Members.</p>
<h2>Corrections and Updates</h2>
<p>To change or modify information you previously provided, you may (i) use the User Profile Manager within the "My Account" section of the site or (ii) send an email to <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is infallible. Any information you transmit through our site is done at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we will take every reasonable precaution to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>If at some point in the future, there is a change to our information usage practices that affect your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by email of the relevant changes. At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com.</a></p>
