      <br><br>
      <span class="StaticPgText">Cvent provides visitors to our website with access to powerful event planning and event marketing tools.  Event planners (“Planner”) use our tools to create an online marketing campaign for an event and to register invitees (“Invitees”) (Planners and Invitees, collectively “Members”).
      <br><br><span class="StaticPgDarkBlueTextBold">information gathered</span>
      <br><br>
      </span><span class="StaticPgText">We collect information from our Members to enhance their experience on our site.  Information allows us to tailor our service to our Members’ needs and deliver content-specific information to match their interests.  Depending on the services and transactions a Member wishes to perform, we may request additional information from a Member from time to time.  For example, we may ask about preferences related to the best time to host an event.  We request this information to provide a more personalized online experience.  Although no one is required to give us any personal information to access our site initially, registering with us permits a Member to take advantage of all our unique services.</span>
      <br><br><span class="StaticPgDarkBlueTextBold">privacy protections and use of information</span>
      <br><br>
      <span class="StaticPgText">Unless we have your permission, we will not disclose or share personally identifiable information collected on our website with any third party (except as required by law or pursuant to a governmental request).
      <br><br>
      <u>Aggregate Data</u>. We may share reports with third parties based on aggregated data of our Members (“Aggregated Member Data”).  Aggregated Member Data does not include any personally identifiable information about Planners or Invitees.  For example, these reports will not include your personal or company name.   Information about Members is aggregated for the purposes of determining successful event benchmarks, reporting to advertisers, business partners and other similar activities.
      <br><br>
      <u>Event Registration</u>. When you register for an event on our site, you have granted us permission to release the information you entered as an Invitee to the Planner.
      <br><br>
      <u>Sponsors and Partners</u>. When we offer co-branded services or sponsorships to you in conjunction with a partner, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company.  If you do not want your personal information to be shared, you can opt-out of that particular service before the information is transferred.
      <br><br>
      <u>Promotions</u>. You may be occasionally offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties selected by us.  If you opt-in to receive information from these third parties, you grant us permission to share your personal information with them.
      <br><br>
      <u>Special Circumstances</u>. We may disclose personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who is violating our Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with other Cvent users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
      <br><br>
      <u>Cookies</u>. A cookie is a small data file that some websites write to your hard drive when you visit them.  A cookie may contain information like a user ID that allows the site to track which web pages you have visited.  The only personal information a cookie contains is information you decide to supply.  A cookie cannot read data from your hard drive or cookie files created by other websites.  We use cookies to deliver content tailored to your preferences; to save your user name so you do not have to retype each time; and to “time-out” your session if it is idle for a long period of time.
      <br><br>
      <u>IP Addresses</u>. We may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and administer our website.
       <br><br>
      </span><span class="StaticPgText"><u>Third Party Vendors</u>. We offer third party services such as faxing and postal mail services. If you chose to use these services we will provide our service providers with the necessary information to accomplish your desired service. For example, if you choose to use our faxing service, we will supply the destination fax number and invitation to our faxing company so that they may service you properly.

We use industry-standard secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. We do not sell or rent your personal financial information.
      <br><br>When you engage in an eCommerce transaction on our site using a credit card, your credit card information, including the number and expiration date and your billing and shipping addresses, are passed onto the merchant with whom the transaction was placed; only Cvent and the merchant with whom you placed the order has access to your credit card information.
