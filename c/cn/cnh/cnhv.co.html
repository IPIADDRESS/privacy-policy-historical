<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>We respect your privacy. We only keep track of the absolute minimum of information that is necessary to operate this service.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Miner, Captcha, Shortlinks</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <strong>do not</strong> track users. We <strong>do not</strong> use cookies for purposes other than to store an opt-in token. We <strong>do not</strong> use any third party tracking (Google Analytics, Piwik, …).</li>
<li>We <strong>never</strong> load any resources from hosts other than Coinhive's own. For example, we <strong>do not</strong> load any Fonts from Google Fonts, neither do we use a CDN for JavaScript sources.</li>
<li>We keep your IP address on our servers in working memory (RAM) only. In case of a missbehaving client, the IP address will be kept in RAM for at most 48h. All other IP adresses are purged shortly after you disconnect from our servers.</li>
<li>We <strong>do not</strong> store your IP address.</li>
<li>We may use <code>localStorage()</code> to synchronize miners across multiple browser tabs. A random ID and timestamp is stored in the browser. This information <strong>never</strong> leaves the browser.</li>
<li>For the JavaScript Miner, a website owner may choose to disclose your user name or user id on that website to our servers. In this case, your user name/id will be stored alongside the number hashes solved. No other information is stored on our servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>This Website (coinhive.com)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <strong>do not</strong> track users. We <strong>do not</strong> use any third party tracking (Google Analytics, Piwik, …)</li>
<li>We <strong>never</strong> load any resources from hosts other than Coinhive's own. For example, we <strong>do not</strong> load any Fonts from Google Fonts, neither do we use a CDN for JavaScript sources.</li>
<li>If you have a Coinhive account, we use cookies to keep track of your login session.</li>
<li>If you have a Coinhive account, your email address and password will be stored on our servers. This information <strong>never</strong> leaves our servers. We <strong>will not</strong> disclose your email address to any third party. Your account passwords are stored hashed and salted using bcrypt.</li>
<li>If you register for a Coinhive account, we collect your personal data like first name, last name, company (optional) and address, containing street, post code, city and country, for the purpose of being able to invoice you for our services, if applicable, and to direct kickbacks back to you for referrals. This information is necessary for operating Coinhive’s bookkeeping according to German Law. We will not disclose your personal data with any third party other than those mandatory to be compliant with aforementioned German Law, such as the tax office.</li>
<li>We record your IP address alongside your account information with each login into your Coinhive account. This is used to reproduce what happened in case your account was compromised. We <strong>will not</strong> disclose your IP address to any third party. IP adresses will be deleted after 30 days.</li>
