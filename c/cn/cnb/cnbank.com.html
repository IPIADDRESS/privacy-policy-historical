				<h1>Privacy Policy Notice</h1>
				<h2>Canandaigua National Corporation</h2>
				<p>Canandaigua National Corporation recognizes its customers' expectations 
            of financial privacy, and preserving our customers' trust is one of 
            the core values of our bank and our family of financial service companies. 
            For over 120 years, respecting and protecting customer privacy has 
			been vital to our business.</p>
			
            <p><b>Our Security Procedures</b><br>
              We are committed to the privacy of customer information and will use 
			  strict security standards to safeguard it. We restrict access to your 
			  personal and account information to those employees who need to know 
			  that information to provide products or services to you. All of 
			  Canandaigua National Corporation and our family of financial service 
			  companies are governed by a code of conduct that includes the 
			  commitment to protect the confidentiality of customer information. 
			  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that 
			  comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal 
			  information. We are equally committed to protecting the privacy 
			  of customer information on the Internet.  For information on the

            </p>

            <p><b>What Information We Collect</b><br>
              We collect only information that is needed to serve you and administer 
              our business. In the process of serving you, we may collect "nonpublic 
              personal information"-information about you that is not available 
              publicly. This information comes to us from various sources, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Information we receive from you on applications or other loan 
                and account forms;</li>
              <li>Information related to your transactions with us, our family 
                of financial services companies listed below (affiliates) or others; 
                and</li>
              <li>Information we receive from third parties such as credit bureaus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>What Information We Disclose</b><br>
              We are permitted under law to share information about our experiences 
              or transactions with you or your account (such as your account balance 
              and your payment history with us) with companies related to us by 
              common control or ownership (affiliates). We also may share additional 
              information about you or your account (such as information we receive 
              from you in applications and information from credit reporting agencies) 
              with our affiliates. </p>
            <p>You may instruct Canandaigua National Corporation not to share 
              information (other than information related to account history and 
              our experiences with you) within the Canandaigua National Corporation 
              family of financial service companies, and to limit marketing offers based on this personal information, by calling us toll free at 
              1-800-724-2621.</p>
            <p>We may also disclose all of the information we collect, as described 
              above, to companies that perform marketing or other services on 
              our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have 
              joint marketing agreements.</p>
            <p>We also are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal 
              information about you to nonaffiliated third parties (i.e., third 
              parties that are not members of our corporate family) in limited 
              circumstances. For example, we may disclose nonpublic personal information 
              about you to such third parties to assist us in servicing your loan 
              or account with us; to government entities in response to subpoenas; 
              and to credit bureaus. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal 
              information about you to any other third parties, except as permitted 
              by law.</p>
            <p>If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, 
              we will continue to adhere to the privacy policy and practices described 
              in this notice.</p>

            <p><strong><a name="internet">Internet</a> Security at Canandaigua National Bank and Trust:<br>
              What You Should Know</strong></p>
            <p>We are equally committed to protecting the privacy of customer 
              information on the Internet. </p>
            <p>Protecting the financial transactions of our customers is of the 
              highest importance for Canandaigua National Bank's Internet banking 
              service. Canandaigua National Bank's security architecture uses 
              several layers of technology to ensure the confidentiality of transactions 
              across the Internet, but also depends on the vigilance of our customers 
              in viewing their transactions and immediately reporting any discrepancies.</p>
            <p>Security begins with your browser. To protect transactions, Canandaigua 
              National Bank accepts Internet logins originating from a browser 
              that supports a high level of encryption. Encryption prevents transactions 
              from being "read" by unauthorized parties over the Internet. 
              All logins to Canandaigua National Bank's web site are encrypted.            </p>
            <p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used as the "pathway" 
              to provide privacy for the data flowing between the browser and 
              the Canandaigua National Bank Internet server. SSL provides a secure 
              channel for data transmission over the Internet. It also allows 
              for the transfer of digital signatures for authentication procedures and provides message integrity, ensuring 
              that the data can't be altered en route. Canandaigua National Bank 
              Internet customers can be assured they are actually communicating 
              with the Canandaigua National Bank Internet server and not a third 
              party trying to intercept the transaction on the Internet.</p>
            <p>When a login is initiated, the browser logs on to Canandaigua National 
              Bank's web site. A secure message via SSL is then initiated with 
              a Canandaigua National Bank Internet server. The server responds 
              by authenticating the customer and initiating session encryption. 
              When a session is encrypted, the browser's icon indicating a secure 
              session becomes activated. If the icon appears broken or not highlighted, 
              encryption is not in use and the current session is not secure. 
            </p>
            <p>Once the Internet session is securely established, Canandaigua 
              National Bank's systems process and route transaction data using 
              internal protocols. This prevents non-Canandaigua Internet traffic 
              from proceeding past Canandaigua National Bank's series of firewalls 
              and filtering routers. </p>
            <p>Customers must treat their Canandaigua National Bank Internet user 
              ID and password with the same care as they treat their ATM or credit 
              card PIN. In addition, a Canandaigua National Bank Internet user 
              must make sure that no one is physically watching as his password 
              is entered. If a user has logged into Canandaigua National Bank's 
              Internet, he should exit the browser when leaving the computer unattended. 
            </p>
            <p>Canandaigua National Bank will continually look for new advances 
              in security technology and will modify its architecture to ensure 
              that we provide the highest level of privacy and safety for our 
              customers. </p>
            <p><b>While Canandaigua National Bank and Trust takes prudent safety 
              measures to provide Internet and other electronic services, it is 
              incumbent upon customers to reconcile their statements or other 
              bank communications upon receipt (or viewing), and report immediately 
              any questionable activity. In addition, all passwords or other codes 
              must be protected from any source that would compromise your privacy. 
              </b> </p>
            <p>In addition, we encourage our customers to learn more about Internet 
              Security and Electronic commerce at a representative sample of sites
