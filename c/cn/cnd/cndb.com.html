						<h1 class="purpletext">Privacy Statement for CNdb.com</h1>
<p>
At CNDB.com, we respect and protect your privacy. Our site is a safe environment
for anyone who visits and becomes a member or purchases items from us. As an
entertainment-related products and services provider, we are committed to
providing you the best possible online service and experience, as well as the
best products. The purpose of this policy statement is to fully share with you
how we feel about the most important aspects of using this site.
</p>

<h4>What information does CNDB.com collect and how is it used?</h4>

<p>
<strong>A.</strong> When you visit the CNDB.com site, we collect some basic information that does
not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited and any
feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with thousands of
other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the
site as valuable and efficient as possible.
</p>

<p>
<strong>B.</strong> Our site will eventually use cookies to speed navigation, keep track of
items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to
remember information you gave us so you don't have to reenter it each time you
visit the site. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, cookies also
help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and
updates to the site are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages
viewed.
</p>

<p>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set
yours to refuse cookies. You will not be able to login to CNDB.com if you turn
off the cookies option.
</p>

<p>
<strong>C.</strong> When you become a registered reviewer with us or post to a discussion, you
provide such personal information as:
</p>

<p>
Username<br>
Password<br>
Email address<br>
</p>

<h4>We use this information as follows:</h4>

<ol>
<li>
The e-mail address members supply us with is never sold to any other website
owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you do. This is why we will only
send you e-mail about items that we feel you should know about. This includes
special promotional items that we endorse, membership changes, terms and
conditions changes, Holiday cards, and as always, the latest happenings on
CNDB.com. If you would like not to be notified by e-mail or would like to change
you e-mail address, please send us a note with the customer service form and let
us know how we can best serve you.
</li>
<li>The Username and Password will be used for you to login to your reviewer
account to make additions, subtractions and edits.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Special Promotional Offers</h4>

<p>
From time to time, CNDB.com would like to share with you special promotional
offers from other companies, which have been specially screened by us. These
offers would provide valuable savings to you. All CNDB.com customers will be
given the opportunity to not receive these offers if they prefer, simply send us
a note with the customer service form and let us know you would not like to be
notified of special offers and promotions.
</p>

<h4>How does CNDB.com protect the privacy of children younger than 18?</h4>

<p>
CNDB.com supports all the efforts of the current on-line movement to restrict
access to adult content sites. We support efforts to restrict access but do not
believe that the so-called age verification services that are available today
are more than thinly veiled attempts of entrepreneurs trying to turn a buck. We
restrict the images that are available to the general visitor to fully clothed
or scantily clad appearances in films by the actresses that are listed on our
site. We do not want our junior visitors to be left out from the information
that is available, but we do not want to contribute to their delinquency by
allowing sexually oriented content to be viewed without first obtaining a credit
card number as a way of verifying their age. Let's face it, if you want to get
in to see the pictures, you're going to have to pay for it.
</p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>
By using the CNDB.com site, you consent to the collection and use of your
information by CNDB.com as described in this policy.
</p>

<p>
CNDB.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who
use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to release
information about members who we believe are in violation of our content
guidelines. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful.
</p>

<p>
CNDB.com wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners
that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third
parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the
Internet, CNDB.com cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. We
encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any
web site.
</p>

<p>
Please check this page periodically for changes. By using this site, you signify
your agreement to the CNDB.com Privacy Policy.
