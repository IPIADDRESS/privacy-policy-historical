<p>b) to deliver more targeted marketing campaigns</p>
<p>c) to provide customers who have supplied their email address, mobile or telephone number and postcode with relevant and timely communications by email, SMS and telephone.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide when requesting or using services on </strong><a href="http://www.cargiant.co.uk/"><strong>www.cargiant.co.uk<br> </strong></a>If you would like to request a call back, book a test drive, add cars to your watchlist, add cars to compare or sign up for estock alerts you will be required to supply your full name, email address, postcode and mobile telephone number. Your contact details are collected to enable us to contact you directly depending on your request.</p>
<p>If you would like to apply for a free online valuation&nbsp;of your car you will be required to supply your VRN (vehicle registration number), approximate mileage, postcode, your name, mobile number (we need this to send a validation code to reveal your valuation) and email address. Your details will be used to provide an estimated online valuation which is based on our assumptions and the limited details about your car you’ve shared with us. We always carry out a full inspection on-site before we offer to part exchange a vehicle or buy a car. If we think that anything in the car’s history or condition will affect its value, including damage, unusual features or customisation, the price that we offer for it will be different to the valuation we gave you online.</p>
<p>If you would like to apply for finance online you will be required to supply your name, email address, telephone number, date of birth, marital status, driving license type, residential status, monthly income, employment type and duration. If you make an application, your details will be held and used in a credit scoring or other automated decision making process when assessing your application.</p>
