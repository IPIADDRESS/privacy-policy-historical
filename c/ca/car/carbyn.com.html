<h3>Information Collection and Use on the Client Websites</h3>
<h4>Information Collected and How We Use It</h4>
<p>We collect information (which may include login, password, or other personal information) via the Client Websites when you choose to provide it to us and/or from our Clients. In addition, you or our Client may provide demographic information (such as zip code, or age), or other information as part of registration, sign-in, completing surveys, or otherwise. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of the special features of the Client Websites. Please note that we do not control the data, we only act as a data processor of this data on behalf of our Clients. As a data processor, we will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for their marketing purposes any PII collected by us, unless you direct us to do so.</p>
<p>Synacor may work with third party service providers to augment some of the information you provide on the Client Websites. For example, if you have provided your email address via the Client Websites, we may work with a third party data company to determine your age and zip code, and add that information to our database.</p>
<p>Synacor uses the information provided to us in order to improve the quality of the Client Websites, provide you with customized content according to your preferences, and provide anonymous aggregate reporting for internal and external clients, including disclosing some aggregate information and user statistics to current and prospective clients, advertisers, and content partners in order to describe our services.</p>
<p>Synacor may also use e-mail addresses and other information to respond to users who communicate with us for support purposes or otherwise. If you choose to correspond with Synacor through e-mail, Synacor may retain the content of the correspondences, the e-mail addresses and its responses.</p>
<h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Automatically</h4>
<p>We collect non-personally identifiable traffic data (“Non-PII”) from our Client Websites. Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, information such as your IP address, web pages on the Client Websites which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and the URL of the website from which you entered the Client Website. This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Synacor uses Non-PII to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Client Websites.</p>
<p>Your IP address is not linked by Synacor to PII, but it is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve our Services. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of the Synacor Websites or Client Websites.</p>

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer.

<p>Synacor uses cookies to deliver content specific to end user interests and, with user permission, to save passwords to prevent the need for you to re-enter your password each time you visit that Client Website. Synacor uses cookies or web beacons to collect anonymous data such as site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising auditing and reporting, and personalization.

<p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone.

<h4>Information Relating to Children</h4>
<p>Neither Synacor’s Websites, the Client Websites, nor the Services are designed for those 13 years of age and younger. Synacor does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If the company is made aware that it has received PII from someone under 13, it will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from its records. Children under the age of 13 should not post in any of the blogs, forums, or other editorial sections of the Synacor Websites or the Client Websites.</p>
<h4>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>If you are a user of our Client Websites, the information provided through those websites is owned and controlled by Synacor’s Clients. Please check the privacy policy on the Client Website for instructions on how to modify your personal information with the owner of that information.</p>
<p>If you are a user of Synacor’s Website and would like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any personal information that you have provided to us on such website, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@synacor.com">privacypolicy@synacor.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt, not to exceed thirty (30) days.</p>

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h4>Social Media (Features) and Widgets</h4>
<p>The Synacor Websites and Client Websites may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Client Websites or the Synacor Websites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Client Websites or Synacor Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<h4>Security Procedures</h4>
<p>Synacor has implemented a variety of security measures to protect PII received by Synacor, including containing all PII behind its secured server network and limiting its accessibility to a limited number of authorized persons who have special access rights to such systems. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the PII submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h4>Additional Information</h4>
<p>Synacor’s Website and the Client Websites may contain links to other sites. Synacor is not responsible for the privacy practices, the content or the products and services offered by such websites. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your PII by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Synacor. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to the Synacor Websites or the Client Websites, you should read that site’s privacy statement before providing any PII.</p>

<p>We do not collect any PII on this website unless you apply for a job.

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about a job on the website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website. We do not store this information.</p>
<p>We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our website which may contain PII. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
