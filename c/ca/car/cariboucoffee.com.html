Effective Date: September 3, 2015<br>
Thank you for visiting this website, which is owned by or on behalf of Einstein Noah Restaurant<br>
Group, Inc. or one of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates (referred to collectively as “ENRG” or<br>
the “ENRG Family of Businesses”), which includes, without limitation, Caribou Coffee<br>
Company, Inc.<br>
Please take a few minutes to review this Privacy Policy. It applies to the information—including<br>
personal information—we collect from or about you through any website owned by or on behalf<br>
of ENRG on which it is posted. In this Policy, we refer collectively to the websites it governs as<br>

Questions About This Policy<br>
Your Consent<br>
Please take a few minutes to review this Policy before using our Sites. By using our Sites you are<br>
consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of information as set forth in this Policy. If you<br>
do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you may not access or use our Sites.<br>
This Policy is Part of Our Terms of Use<br>
This Policy is part of the Terms of Use that govern your use of our Sites. A link to our Terms of<br>
Use is provided at the bottom of each page of our Sites.<br>
Privacy Notices<br>
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on<br>
our Sites. These privacy notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more<br>
general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of our Sites may contain<br>
privacy notices providing details about the information we collect on those pages, why we need<br>
that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.<br>
Types of Information We Collect<br>
The information we collect through this Site falls into two categories: (1) data that you manually<br>
supply (by using a keyboard or touch screen), some of which may be Personal Information, and<br>
(2) non-personally identifiable information we collect automatically. In this Policy “Personal<br>
Information” means information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with<br>
other information available to us. Examples of Personal Information include your name, address,<br>
and email address.<br>
Please remember that this Policy applies only to information we obtain through our Sites.<br>
However, we may supplement the information we obtain through our Sites with information we<br>
obtain through other channels, such as from third parties, including our franchisees and data<br>
brokers. For example, we may supplement your profile with demographic and preference<br>
information that is supplied to us for each zip code in our database. By supplementing your<br>
profile, we are better able to provide product recommendations and special offers that will be of<br>
genuine interest to you. We may also use this additional information to further personalize our<br>
Sites and improve your experience while you are on our Sites.<br>
Information You Manually Supply. ENRG collects all the data you and others knowingly,<br>
voluntarily, and manually provide when you use our Sites. Some of this data may be Personal<br>
Information. For example, we collect the Personal Information you provide when you place an<br>
order, sign up for our clubs and/or email updates, or contact us with questions.<br>
At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a<br>
gift or gift card or certificate online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you must submit the<br>
recipient’s name and address. We use this information to send your gift to the recipient. We also<br>
store this information so that you do not have to reenter it the next time you send a gift to the<br>
same recipient. We do not use this information to add the recipient to our mailing lists. On some<br>
of our Sites, you can email a message to a friend by entering your friend’s name and email<br>
address. We use the information you provide to personalize and send the message to your friend.<br>
We do not use this information for our mailing lists.<br>
Some of our Sites have “Career” areas where you can search for open positions and apply for a<br>
job with us. When you submit an employment application, we ask you to provide certain<br>
Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email<br>
address, and employment history. If you send us an email to inquire about a position, the<br>
information we receive is the information you include in your cover letter, resume and email<br>
message. Please note that by submitting your information regarding employment opportunities to<br>
us, you authorize us to transmit and store your information in our recruitment database, to<br>
circulate that information as necessary for the purpose of evaluating your qualifications for job<br>
vacancies at ENRG, and to contact you about a possible employment opportunity. If you are<br>
hired by ENRG, the information you provide during the recruiting process will become part of<br>
our employee records. The Career areas of our Sites are powered by CareerBuilder. To learn<br>
more about the services CareerBuilder provides, please visit CareerBuilder.com.<br>
Information from Third–Party Social Media Platforms: You may be able to register with, log-on<br>
to, or enhance your profile on our Sites through a third–party social media platform, such as<br>
Facebook. By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us registration<br>
information from your profile on that platform. We treat that information as we do any other<br>
information you give to us when you register, log-on, or enhance your profile. After you have<br>
connected, the third party may also send us additional information from your profile that allows<br>
us to offer certain functionalities on the pages you view.<br>
To learn how to disconnect one of our Sites from Facebook, click here. ENRG is not responsible<br>
for Facebook or the use or operation thereof. The foregoing is based on Facebook functionality<br>
as of the effective date of this Policy and you should see the Facebook Help Center for current<br>
information regarding Facebook and Facebook Connect, including use of Facebook Connect and<br>
disconnecting Facebook Connect.<br>
Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser: We collect information that is sent to us<br>
automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the<br>
identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the<br>
name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages on our Sites that<br>
you visit. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends<br>
or how to change your settings.<br>
Your IP address is the identifier assigned to your particular computer when you access the<br>
Internet. IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other Personal Information, but<br>
in some cases, they can be used to identify you. For example, we or our service providers may<br>
link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally. If we suspect<br>
inappropriate or criminal activity or a threat to our Sites or their users, we may also share our<br>
server logs—which contain users’ IP addresses—with the appropriate investigative authorities,<br>
who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.<br>
Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use “cookies” and other web technologies to collect<br>
information and support certain features of our Sites. For example, we may use these<br>
technologies to:<br>
 collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites—which pages they visit, which<br>
links they use, and how long they stay on each page;<br>
 to support the features and functionality of our Sites—for example, to save you the<br>
trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you<br>
established on previous visits;<br>
 to personalize your experience when you use our Sites; and<br>
 to serve targeted advertisements about our products and services.<br>
Generally, the information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you<br>
personally. We may, however, link the information that we collect through cookies with Personal<br>
Information that you provide to us.<br>
Generally, if you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to<br>
alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Please note, however, that your browser<br>
cannot screen out cookies that are sent by email.<br>
Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to<br>
use all of the functionality of this Site if your browser rejects our cookies.<br>
Information from your mobile device: If you download one of our mobile applications or access<br>
one of our Sites through your mobile device, we may automatically collect certain information<br>
from or about your device. The types of information we may collect include the type of device<br>
you use, your device’s unique ID, the IP address of your device, your device’s operating system,<br>
the type of mobile browsers you use, and information about the way you use our mobile<br>
application.<br>
We may also collect information about your device’s geographic location, so that we can direct<br>
you to our nearby stores. We do not retain precise, real-time location information. Your mobile<br>
or tablet device may allow you to adjust your settings so that location information is not<br>
available to any mobile website or application. If you have questions about the security and<br>
privacy settings of your mobile or tablet device, please refer to instructions from your mobile<br>
service provider or the manufacturer of your device.<br>
Collection of Information Through Third-Party Cookies<br>
In addition to the cookies we deliver to your computer through our Sites, certain third parties<br>
may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we use Google Analytics, a<br>
web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites. Other third<br>
parties may deliver cookies to your computer for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors<br>
across nonaffiliated websites and delivering targeted advertisements either on our Sites or on<br>
other websites.<br>
You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Sites. For example,<br>
if you don’t want information about your visit to our Sites sent to Google Analytics, you may<br>
download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here. Please note that the Add-on does not<br>
prevent information from being sent to ENRG.<br>
In addition, if you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected by certain<br>
entities during your visits to our Sites or other websites, please click here. You will be directed to<br>
an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity<br>
may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes. It may be that some of the<br>
third parties that collect interest-based information on our Sites do not participate in the industrydeveloped<br>
opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your<br>
online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies.<br>

 to provide the information, products and services you request;<br>
 for security, credit or fraud prevention purposes;<br>

Steps We Take to Safeguard your Personal Information<br>
We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the<br>
confidentiality and security of Personal Information you submit on or through this Site.<br>
Unfortunately, no website, server or database is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its<br>
absolute security. For this reason, you should use care and discretion when you post content on<br>
this Site.<br>
How We Share Your Information With Others<br>
Third–Party Vendors. We share information collected through our Sites with third-party vendors<br>
who act for or on our behalf. For example, we may use third-party vendors for warehousing and<br>
delivery; marketing and advertising; data processing; software development; website hosting and<br>
management; information technology and office services; and legal, accounting, audit and other<br>
professional services. These third-party vendors may need information about you to perform<br>
their functions.<br>
Within the ENRG Family of Businesses. When you upload information to one of our Sites, the<br>
owner of that Site may share your information with other members of the ENRG Family of<br>
Businesses. Before doing so, however, the owner of the Site may offer you the opportunity to<br>
“opt out” or “opt in,” as required by applicable law. Every member of the ENRG Family of<br>
Businesses is required to handle information collected through our Sites in accordance with this<br>
Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.<br>
Franchisees. Many of our stores are owned and operated by our franchisees. We do not currently<br>
share the information we collect through this Site with our franchisees, except to provide the<br>
products, services or information you request. For example, if you place a catering order, we<br>
will share the information needed to fill your order and provide customer service for the<br>
appropriate store location.<br>
User-Generated Content: In this Policy, “User-Generated Content” or “UGC” refers to all of<br>
content that you post on or through our Sites using the social networking tools we make available<br>
to you and that does not constitute Feedback. The UGC you submit on or through our Sites is<br>
available to others who visit our Sites. Any Personal Information contained in UGC can be read,<br>
collected, or used by others, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. In addition, we<br>
may use UGC you submit on or through our Sites for advertising campaigns and other<br>
promotions. We may or may not use your name in connection with such use, and we may or may<br>
not seek your consent before using the content for such purposes. Therefore, you should have no<br>
expectation of privacy with respect to UGC you submit on or through our Sites. You should not<br>
submit any content you do not wish to make available to the general public, and you must take<br>
special care to make sure your submissions comply with our Terms of Use. In particular, your<br>
submissions must not violate the privacy or other rights of others.<br>
Business Partners. From time to time, we may share your information with selected third parties<br>
(other than our vendors) for their own marketing purposes. Before doing so, however, we may<br>
offer you the opportunity to “opt out” or “opt in” as required by applicable law.<br>
Business Transfers. Your information may be transferred to successor organization if, for<br>
example, we transfer the ownership or operation of one or more of our Sites to another<br>
organization or if we merge with another organization.<br>
Compliance with Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others. We may disclose<br>
your information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the<br>
law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose your information to prevent or<br>
