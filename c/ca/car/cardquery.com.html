   	<p class="subpara"></p>
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THIS DR GLOBALDIRECT, INC. PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO DIGITAL RIVER THROUGH THIS WEB SITE.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO DIGITAL RIVER THROUGH THIS ONLINE STORE, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE COLLECTION, USE, TRANSFER, AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 2, 2009.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>DR globalDirect, Inc. Operates This Web site</strong></p>
	<p>This Web site is hosted and operated by DR globalDirect, Inc. ("we," "us," and "our"), an independent e-commerce reseller.</p>
	<p><strong>Scope of This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
	<p>This DR globalDirect Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy") describes how DR globalDirect protects your privacy when you use this Web site.</p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected through DR globalDirect Web sites. "Personal information" means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.</p>
	<p><strong>Privacy Notices</strong></p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time-to-time by "Privacy Notices" posted on this Web site. These Privacy Notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of this Web site contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.</p>
	<p><strong>Country-Specific Notices</strong></p>
	<p>Privacy requirements vary from country-to-country. To meet these requirements, we have included certain "Country-Specific Notices" as part of this Privacy Policy. You may locate the Country-Specific Notice for your country, if there is one, by scrolling to the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p><strong>This Privacy Policy May Change</strong></p>
	<p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy on this Web site. These changes will only apply to personal information we collect after we have posted the revised Privacy Policy. Your use of this Web site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all personal information collected from or about you through this Web site after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>To alert you to these changes, we will update the effective date of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide a notice at the top of this Privacy Policy for at least 30 days after the new effective date and highlight the changes so that you can locate them easily. Unless the change is a minor change (such as a change in our contact information) or a non-substantive change (such as the reformatting of our Privacy Policy), we will post notices on the page where you submit your order and/or on other relevant pages of this Web site for 30 days after the new effective date to alert you to the change.</p>
	<p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect Through this Web site?</strong></p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Information You Volunteer.</span> We collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Web site, for example, the information you provide when you request information about products or services. This information may include your name, street and e-mail address, phone number, credit card information, and information used to verify your identity or to prevent fraud.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</span> We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed this Web site, the name of your operating system (such as Windows速 or Macintosh速), the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape速 or Internet Explorer速), and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.</p>
	<p>The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve the DR globalDirect Web sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Web site, we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs -- which contain visitors' IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Information Collected Using "Cookies" and Other Web Technologies.</span> We use "cookies," and similar technologies, such as Web Beacons (also referred to as "tracking pixels," or "action tags"), to collect personal information and support the functionality of this Web site. For more information about our use of cookies and Web Beacons, see below.</p>
	<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Cookies and Web Beacons.</span> A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to your computer by our Web server. We may use two types of cookies -- "session cookies" and "persistent cookies."</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Session Cookies.</span> A "session cookie" is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser. A session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access one of our Sites. Assigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the features of our Web sites, by permitting us to maintain a persistent "state" for your session, such as, maintaining the contents of your shopping basket during checkout. We also use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use this Web site - which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "click-stream information") to better understand our visitors' interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this Web site.</p>
	<p>Sessions cookies do not contain your personal information. If, however, you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Web site, we may link the session cookie identification number to information that identifies you personally.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Persistent Cookies.</span> When you visit this Web site, we may place one or more "persistent cookies" on your computer. Unlike a "session cookie," a persistent cookie does not expire when you close your browser. It stays on your computer until it expires (for example, at the end of the calendar year) or until you delete it.</p>
	<p>Some persistent cookies simply "tag" your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognize you, not by name, but by the "tag" on your computer. This will enable us to provide you with a personalized experience even if we do not know who you are. It will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this Web site, for example, how people use this Web site on their first visit and how often they return. If, at some point, you create a user identity, we may link the information collected by these persistent cookies to information in our database that identifies you personally. We may also transfer this information to a cookie and place it on your computer's hard drive so that our web server can read this information each time you visit this Web site. In either case, using persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database.</p>
	<p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Web site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Web site. For example, you will not be able to purchase products and services on this Web site.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Web Beacons.</span> Web beacons (also referred to as "tracking pixels" or "action tags") are graphic images, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, placed at various locations on our Site. Web beacons help us recognize the cookies on your browser. Like cookies, Web beacons help us collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites. They also help us identify browser types, IP addresses, search terms that bring visitors to our Sites, and the domain names of the Web sites that refer traffic to us. The information collected by Web beacons does not identify you personally. However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Web site, for example, by making a purchase, we may link the information we collect using Web beacons to the information that identifies you personally and use it in the same ways as we use the information we collect using cookies. Lastly, we utilize web beacons to provide us with more information on any emails we send out, in particular, the web beacons will send us information to let us know that you have received and opened any e-mail you have chosen to receive from us.</p>
	<p><strong>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</strong></p>
	<p>DR globalDirect uses the personal information we collect on this Web site:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>for lead generation;</li>
		<li>if you've made a purchase from one of our other sites and came to this site;</li>
		<li>to take, process or deliver your order, process or obtain payment, or notify you of the status of your order;</li>
		<li>in connection with keys, access codes or other information as may be required to permit you to access Partner Web sites to receive products, updates or services;</li>
		<li>for security, credit or fraud prevention purposes;</li>
		<li>to register your purchase with the manufacturer or service provider for warranty, technical support or similar purposes;</li>
		<li>to facilitate the renewal of subscriptions for products or services;</li>
		<li>to provide you with effective customer service and/or technical support;</li>
		<li>to provide you with a personalized shopping experience;</li>
		<li>to provide you, with your consent, with product updates and upgrades, special offers, pricing information, newsletters, and any other information you request;</li>
		<li>to undertake, with your consent, any other promotional activities; and</li>
		<li>to improve this Web site, the customer experience, and related products or services.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition, we may use specific personal information for the purposes identified in a specific Privacy Notice posted on the page or area of this Web site where you provided that information.
	</p><p>We may remove all of the information that identifies you specifically and use the rest for historical, statistical or scientific purposes.</p>
	<p><strong>With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</strong></p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Our Partners.</span> DR globalDirect is an independent e-commerce reseller. If you are coming to this Site to contact us regarding a product or service you purchased from another Site, we provide your personal information to the Partner whose name and logo appear on that Web site. We may share your personal information in order to register your purchase with the Partner whose name and logo appear at the top of each page of this Web site (or that Partner's service provider) for warranty, technical support, after sales service, or similar purposes. We also pass on to our Partner the privacy preferences you have expressed on our Web site. For example, if you have asked to be added to our Partner's mailing lists, we will pass on that information. If you have declined an opportunity to be added to our Partner's mailing lists, we will also pass on that information. We do not provide your credit card information to our Partner unless you have purchased a subscription that qualifies for automatic renewal (see below). Our Partner's privacy policy will govern how our Partner uses and protects your personal information.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Our Service Providers.</span> DR globalDirect employs other companies, including our affiliates, to provide services to us or on our behalf. For example, we may use other companies to maintain this Web site, to process credit card payments, detect and prevent fraud, deliver packages, send mail or e-mail, or provide customer service. These companies are required by contract to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services to us or on our behalf and to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">As Disclosed in a Privacy Notice.</span> We may share specific personal information as disclosed in a specific Privacy Notice posted on the page or area of this Web site where you provided that information.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">For Marketing Purposes.</span> We will not share your personal information with our affiliates or unrelated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Property, You and Others.</span> There are other limited circumstances in which we may share the personal information in our databases with unrelated third parties. For example, we may disclose the personal information we collect on this Site without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; to comply with a subpoena or court order; to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of DR globalDirect, our affiliates, our employees, agents, other users or the public in general or to protect your vital interests. We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful without providing notice to you.</p>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic;">In Connection With Corporate Events.</span> We may transfer your personal information to another company (either an affiliate of DR globalDirect or an unrelated third party) that has acquired the stock or assets of DR globalDirect, one of our affiliates, or one of our operating divisions, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, any applicable Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>
	<p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
	<p>DR globalDirect respects your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. We generally ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your personal information.</p>
	<p>When you provide personal information, we may offer you a choice as to whether you would like to receive further communications from us about certain updates, upgrades, special offers and pricing. We may also ask if you would like to be added to our Partner's mailing lists. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you decide you no longer want to receive promotional messages from us, you may let us know by e-mailing us at remove@digitalriver.com or by following any unsubscribe link in our emails. Please note, however, if you give us permission to add your contact information to our Partner's mailing list and later withdraw your permission, you will have to contact our Partner (or use the "opt-out" provided in the e-mails our Partner sends you) to have your name removed from our Partner's mailing lists.</p>

	<p>We strive to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the personal information in our databases and to keep that information up-to-date.

In most cases, we will provide the access you request and correct or delete any inaccurate personal information you discover. We reserve the right, however, to limit or deny your request to the extent permitted by applicable law if: 1) the disclosure may harm the life, the body, the property and the rights of third parties, 2) the disclosure may lead to a breach of applicable law and regulation, or 3) where you have failed to provide sufficient evidence to verify your identity.</p>
