<p>We don't sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we disclose the information to third parties, except where required by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies).</p>
<p>If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through the CarSite.co.uk website then you can find out how to do this below.</p>
<div>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4 Why we collect your data?</h4>
<p>By collecting your data, it allows us to understand what your needs and wants are, provide personalised content and match the most relevant adverts and services for you. It also allows us to provide targeted offers and services you may be interested to hear about.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.1. Essential Cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies are essential for the running of our websites. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function. For example our mobile site uses cookies to help us identify which of our readers is viewing the site on a mobile device.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.2. Analytical Performance Cookies</h4>
<p>We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites performance and how their users may use it. These cookies provide us with information that helps us provide better products to their users and also to identify any areas that may need maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information on how Google uses the data it collects from the website see here&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></p>
<p><span>To opt out of being tracked via Google Analytics, you can also use Google's opt-out browser add-on:&nbsp;</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.3. Functional Cookies</h4>
<p>Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites. This can be anything from remembering your city in a weather forecast or saving your username.</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.4.4. Behavioural Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies</h4>
<p>With your explicit consent, we - and our advertisers/sponsors - may use cookies to provide tailored advertisements to you which we believe are relevant to you. More information about these cookies can be found at<span>&nbsp;</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/</a>&nbsp;and details on how to disable them can be found at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online behavioural advertising is a way of providing advertisements on the websites you visit that are relevant to your interests. This is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity. Advertising is then displayed to you when you visit a website which matches these interests.</p>
<p>Behavioural advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time - so it's different to advertising you may see when you're looking for something online using a search engine (eg Google) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time.</p>
<p>As an example, you may be doing research in order to buy a car and read a number of different articles on a number of different websites. If a car manufacturer was part of an advertising network, they may think that you are interested in buying a car and serve you with one of their adverts for one of their cars. It is possible that from reading these articles elsewhere, you would see this advert on one of our (or someone else's) websites.</p>
<p>We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on your computer by third party advertisers and sponsors.</p>
<p>We may also track IP addresses. An IP Address is a number that can identify an Internet Service Provider and country location. It cannot provide personal information</p>
<h4 class="mt10">7.5 How to control the use of cookies</h4>
<p>You are not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. The browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows you to control their use.</p>
<p>You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting all of them. You can also set your browser to not accept cookies altogether. If this option is selected, you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device. This gives you control over what is set on your device, however has the drawback of slowing down your browsing experience.</p>
<p>There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent just third party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of behavioural advertising, and some even allow you to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies.</p>

<h2 class="mt10 bordertb">9. Ad Serving - Personalised, Non-Personalised and Opting In/Out</h2>
<p>9.1 Personlised Ads</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when users visit our Web Site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including name, address, email address or telephone number) about the user's visits to this and other Web Sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that are of interest to the user. But we will only show this type of personalised advert if the user has given explicit permission to do so. See section 7.4.4 of this document for more information about how this works.</p>
<p>9.2 Non personalised Ads</p>
<p>Should the user not choose to opt in to have personalised adverts displayed to them, we may still display ads on the pages that the user is viewing, but the advertisements displayed will not be personalised. The adverts in this case will either be totally random or contextually relevant to the content that the user is browsing.</p>
<p>9.3 Opting In and Opting Out</p>
<p>As previously stated we will not show personalised ads without an explicit opt in from the user. However, should the user change their mind, (e.g. initially they opted in, but now they would like to opt out) they can email us at support@carsite.co.uk and let us know.</p>
