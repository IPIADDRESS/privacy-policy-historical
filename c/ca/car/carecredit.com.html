			<p><strong>Information Collected</strong></p>
			<p>In general, you can visit this Web site without  telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web  servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our  web servers also may seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie"  (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to  determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical  information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site. This  cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the  information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to  improve site navigation and is not shared with anyone other than CareCredit  affiliates and contractors who assist CareCredit in these efforts and are bound  to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set  your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.</p>
			<p>In addition, there are portions of this Web  site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific  purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The  information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax  number, or e-mail address. </p>
			<p>This Web site is not intended for  persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal  information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products  or services to children.</p>
			<a name="#useinfo"></a>
			<p><strong>Use of Collected Information</strong></p>
			<p>Domain name information that we collect is not  used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number  of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this  information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our  site.</p>
			<p>When other information is collected from you,  such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of  collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the  personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process  your request.&nbsp; This information may be  shared with other CareCredit affiliates (?), but only if necessary to fulfill  your request or for related purposes.</p>
			<p>We may share the personal information you  provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These  companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information  we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide.  We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any  third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if  you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally  limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).</p>
			<a name="#othersites"></a>
			<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
			<p>CareCreditâ€™s Web site may contain links to  other sites.&nbsp; While we try to link only  to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not  responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other  sites.</p>
			<a name="#securityinfo"></a>
			<p><strong>Security of Collected Information</strong></p>
			<p>We maintain strict physical, electronic, and  administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from  unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about  you to those CareCredit workers who need to know the information to respond to  your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to  disciplinary action.</p>
