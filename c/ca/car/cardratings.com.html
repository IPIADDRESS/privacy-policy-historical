<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. &nbsp;In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). &nbsp;If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site. &nbsp;We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

CardRatings.com provides extensive credit card comparison information. We list
cards regardless of whether a particular bank is advertising on our site,
although not all available credit cards are listed. Advertisers in our database
are highlighted, and advertisements include an option to apply using links on
our site. CardRatings.com may be compensated by companies mentioned on the site
when a user's application is accepted or approved by such companies. 
Advertising allows us to provide free tools and information for consumers.
Because credit card offers change frequently, please visit the card issuer site
for current information.
