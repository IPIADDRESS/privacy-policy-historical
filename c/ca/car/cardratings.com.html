<p><strong>How you can access, change or suppress your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, delete or otherwise limit our use, on a going-forward basis, of your Personal Information that has been previously provided to us, you may do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@quinstreet.com">info@quinstreet.com</a> and provide the name of the service for which information was provided, your full name, mailing address, phone number and email address so that we may identify you in the opt-out process.&nbsp; For your protection, we will only implement such requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular e-mail address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.<strong></strong></p>
<p>In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information.&nbsp; We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp; In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer's personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request this information by writing to us at the address below.
