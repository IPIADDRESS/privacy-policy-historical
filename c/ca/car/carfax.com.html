      When you order CARFAX Vehicle History Reports, we require your name, mailing address,
      e-mail address, credit card number, and expiration date. This information allows us to process
      your order and deliver your reports to you.</p>

      <p>For each CARFAX Vehicle History Report you request, you will also enter the Vehicle
      Identification Number (VIN). This is the unique 17-character identification number that is used
      to search our database for information about the vehicle's history.  Once you enter the VIN of
      a vehicle, the CARFAX report will appear on screen and an email version of the same CARFAX Report
      will be sent to you via email for your records.  </p>

      <p>You may be asked to complete brief surveys while on the CARFAX web site. These surveys help us
      to better understand how you are using the information, and help us to develop better products
      and services for you. These surveys may be administered by CARFAX or by a third party.</p>

      <p>You may receive periodic email communications from CARFAX that include special offers and
      promotions related to the used car buying and ownership process.  Should you choose to "opt-out" of
      receiving these email communications, you will only receive the email communications that contain the
      CARFAX Reports you order. To unsubscribe to any of our communications or ask any questions about
      our services or our products, please <a href="http://carfax.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/carfax.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?">

      <p>We also track user traffic patterns to uncover ways in which we can improve the site and make it
      easier to use. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how many customers look at each page.</p>

      <a href="#top"><font size="1">(back to top)</font></a><br>
      When you place an order with CARFAX, we offer the use of a secure server. All information you enter is
      encrypted via a secure sockets layer (SSL) before it is sent over the Internet to our secure servers.
      Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. If you have questions about security
      on our Web site, please <a href="http://carfax.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/carfax.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?">click here</a> to contact us.</p>
