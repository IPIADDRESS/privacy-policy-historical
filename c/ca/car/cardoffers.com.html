                an approval, rate, quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a "Request").

                    IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE,
                    TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A

            <p>
                If you are matched with a Service Provider, you expressly consent to the Service Provider conducting any
                research necessary to provide you with information about your Request. Service Providers may need to share
                Your Information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request credit card offers, consumer reports
                may be ordered in connection with your request. Such reports may provide information that may assist in
                determining eligibility for credit card offers. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or
                extensions of credit card offers.
                <strong>
                    If you do not want Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your
                    Request, then you should not submit a Request. Please note that if you submit a Request through our
                    Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will
                    not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.

            <p class="underline">Aggregation and De-Personalization</p>

            <p>
                We may take Your Information and de-identify it either by combining it with information about other individuals
                (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics
                (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information).
                We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties
                at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.

                loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for
                any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely

                standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

            <p>
                No method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
                Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information
                to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept
                or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within
                this Privacy Policy, our <a href="/terms.php">Terms of Use</a> or any other applicable agreement or policy,
                <strong>you use our Services at your own risk</strong> and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should
                not expect, that Your Information will always remain private. In the event that an unauthorized third party
                compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused
                by an unauthorized third party's ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.

                collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personal information contained
                in such databases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer. A "Business Transfer"
                means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or
                other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated
                and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business. Nothing in
                this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity,
                and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any lawful
                purpose, without compensation to you.

            <h2>Network Advertising</h2>

            <p>
                From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers,
                advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks
                for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising
                networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer's
                interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to
                the consumer's specific interests. This practice is often referred to as "online behavioral advertising."
                For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type
                of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific
                pages of a website, the location of your Internet service provider's presence, the date and time of
                a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website. Please see the "Online Behavioral
                Advertising" subsection of Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information below to read about
                how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.
            </p>

            <h2>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</h2>

            <p>
                We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. Below are some
                mechanisms that provide you with control over certain information:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Cookies</em>. If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies,
                    or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of our Services
                    may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Email Offers from Us</em>. If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you
                    can opt out of receiving email information from us (other than emails related to the completion of your
                    registration, correction of user data, change of password and other similar communications essential
                    to your transactions through our Services) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Accessing and Correcting Personal Information</em>. If your personal information changes, or if
                    you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove by sending us an email
                    at <a href="mailto:support@creditcards.com">support@creditcards.com</a>. We will respond to your request
                    within a reasonable timeframe. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active
                    or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply
                    with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In addition, if the portion
                    of our Services allows you to create an account with us, then you can review and update Your Information
                    by logging into that portion of our Services, visiting your account profile page and making changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Online Behavioral Advertising</em>. Certain third-party advertising networks that deliver behavioral
                    advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). You can prevent DAA member
                    companies from collecting preference data about you by clicking <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">here</a>
                    and following the DAA's directions. Note that if you opt out through the DAA, you will still receive
                    advertising. In addition, if you opt out through the DAA and later delete your cookies, use a different
                    browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt out choice.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Information You Disclose to Third Parties</h2>

            <p>
                You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties

                privacy policy and practices of such third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and
                practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of
                such third parties prior to disclosing information to them. If you later decide that you no longer want
                to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. If those
                third parties share your information with us, then we will treat that information in accordance with this
                Privacy Policy.
            </p>

                to websites operated by third parties that are beyond our control. For example, if you click to apply for
                a product such as a credit card through our Services, you may be linked to a third-party website to complete
                an application. Links or access to third parties from our Services are not an endorsement by us of such
                third parties, or their websites, applications, products, services, or practices. We are not responsible
                for the privacy policy, terms and conditions, practices or the content of such third parties. These
                third-parties may send their own cookies to you and independently collect data. If you visit or access a
                third-party website, application or other property that is linked or accessed from our Services, we encourage
                you to read any privacy policies and terms and conditions of that third party before providing any personal
                information. If you have a question about the terms and conditions, privacy policy, practices or contents
                of a third party, please contact the third party directly.
