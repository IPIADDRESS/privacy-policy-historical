    <div>Last Updated: 09/29/2016</div>
    <h3>Introduction and Scope of Practices.</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. (“Blackhawk,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and its affiliates and subsidiaries worldwide, including, but not limited to, Blackhawk Network, Inc., Blackhawk Network California, Inc., Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, Inc., Cardpool, Inc., CardLab, Inc., and Omni Prepaid, LLC (but not including Achievers Solutions, Inc. and Achievers, LLC, which have a separate policy). The Policy applies any time you deal with Blackhawk, whether in person, by telephone, by mail, or at any online or mobile site or application that we own and control (“Site”). The only exception to this is if different practices are provided and state that they apply instead of this Policy.</p>
    <p>This Policy explains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how we collect, use, and share information from or about you;</li>
      <li>how our online advertisements (such as banner ads) on thirdparty sites treat data;</li>
      <li>your choices about our use of your personal information; and</li>
      <li>how you can access and update your information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes, we appear on a site owned by a third party (like a Blackhawk page or handle on a social media site) or link to a third party site. When we do, that third party’s privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, will apply unless you are told otherwise. Also, some of Blackhawk’s services (“Services”) are offered through banks or other financial institutions. In those cases, the third parties’ policies will govern their use of consumer data.</p>

    <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”).</span>
      PII means information or a combination of information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific person. We may collect the following types of PII from you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact information, such as name, email address, mailing address, fax or phone number;</li>
      <li>Payment and financial information, such as credit or other payment card information, bank account, or billing address;</li>
      <li>Social Security Number or other national tax ID number</li>
      <li>Device geolocation (geographical location)</li>
      <li>Unique identifiers such as user name, account number, or password; and,</li>
      <li>Preference information such as product wish lists, order history, or marketing preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes, we may combine PII you provide with information from third-party sources. For example, we may confirm your address with the postal service or verify your personal information with a credit-reporting agency. We will treat the combined information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Other Information (“OI”).</span>
      OI is any information other than PII that does not reveal your identity or directly relate to a person. We may collect the following OI from you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information about your business such as company name, company size, or business type;</li>
      <li>Demographic information, such as age, gender, interests and ZIP code;</li>
      <li>Device and other tracking information, such as browser information, device identifiers, operating system, or information gained from cookies, pixels or other tracking technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OI may also include PII we have de-identified or aggregated to the point where it no longer identifies a particular individual. If we ever combine OI with any PII, we treat it as PII is treated under this Policy. In some jurisdictions, some OI may be considered PII by law. In those cases, we will treat the information as PII is treated under this Policy.</p>

    <h3>How We Collect Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <p>We collect PII when you provide it to us.  This can occur when you fill out applications, create accounts, send in forms, take surveys, or fill in various online fields on our Sites. We also collect PII when you contact us with inquiries, customer support requests, or employment applications.</p>
    <p>We may also collect the PII of third parties when you provide it to us. If you choose to use our service to send a gift to a friend or register a family member for an account, we will ask you for your their name and address or email address. Blackhawk stores this information for the sole purpose of completing the transaction. If you provide PII of a friend or family member and they want us to delete this information, they should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bhnetwork.com">privacy@bhnetwork.com</a>. We may not always be able to remove their PII. We will let them know if we cannot do so and why.</p>

    <p>We may use PII we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>to verify your identity and/or location in order to allow access to your accounts, conduct online transactions, and secure your PII;</li>

      <ul>

You may request that certain information that you enter into our Sites be stored for future access and use. You have the option not to save the information;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>to assist in verifying your identity and account status when we deal with you through our social media pages . We may combine this information with information we already have;</li>
      <li>to enable you to post your resume, search job postings, and contact or be contacted by Blackhawk for prospective employment;</li>

    <p><span class="bold">Log files:</span> Most browsers collect certain information, such as your IP address, device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and internet browser type and version. This information is gathered automatically and stored in log files. We may link this data to PII we have collected about you.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Tracking technologies:</span> We and our service providers use cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and HTML5 local storage. These technologies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on our Sites, pages visited, language preferences, and your relationship with us. We can use this information to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, measure the effectiveness of our communications, tailor our advertising to you, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
    <p>You can refuse to accept cookies. Most devices and browsers offer their own privacy settings for cookies and HTML5 local storage. You will need to manage your cookie settings for each device and browser you use. However, if you elect not to accept cookies, your use of the features on our Sites may be limited or impaired, and you may not be able to access certain features of our Sites at all.</p>

    <h3>Security and Retention</h3>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.

    <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <h3>“Do Not Track” Preferences</h3>
    <p>Many browsers provide you an option to request that a web application disable either its tracking and/or crosssite user tracking of an individual user.  We do not track your online activities across different Sites, and we only track your activity within a Site to the extent you log into your account.</p>
    <p>Therefore, our practices remain the same whether or not you enable the “Do Not Track” feature.</p>

    <h3>Protecting Children’s Privacy Online</h3>
    <p>Our Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide PII through our Sites. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. Among other things, such staff may process and store your information and provide support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
