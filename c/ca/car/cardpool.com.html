  <!-- Cardpool Consumer Privacy Policy -->
  <div id="consumer_privacy_policy">
    <h2>Cardpool Consumer Privacy Policy</h2>
    <div>Last Updated: Feb 1, 2019</div>
    <h3>Introduction and Scope of Practices.</h3>
    <p>Cardpool cares about your personal information.  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the personal data we collect, how we use this data, with whom we share it, and the choices individuals have about our use of this data.  The Policy applies to the personal data Cardpool collects about users of our websites (including 
      <a href="http://www.Cardpool.com">www.Cardpool.com</a>) mobile applications, and the services and features therein (together the "Sites"), as well as the data we collect in providing our services (the "Services") and when individuals communicate with us about our Sites and Services,  whether in person, by telephone, by mail, or other means, unless you are notified at the time we collect your personal data that a different privacy policy applies. When we act as a data processor on behalf of another controller, we collect, use, and disclose certain personal data only under the controller’s instruction, and their privacy policy will apply to how they (and we on their behalf) process your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>This Policy explains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How we collect, use, and share information from or about you;</li>
      <li>How our online advertisements (such as banner ads) on third party sites treat data;</li>
      <li>Your choices about our use of your personal data;</li>
      <li>How you can access and update your information; and</li>
      <li>How you can exercise your rights</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes, we appear on a site owned by a third party (like a Cardpool page or handle on a social media site) or link to a third party site. When we do, that third party's privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, will apply unless you are told otherwise. Also, some of Cardpool's services ("Services") are offered through banks or other financial institutions. In those cases, the third parties' policies will govern their use of consumer data.</p>

    <h3>How We Collect Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person or a combination of information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific person. We may collect Personal Data directly from you, when you provide it to us. This can occur when you fill out applications, create accounts, complete a purchase, add money to your account, send in forms, take surveys, or fill in various online fields on our Sites. We also collect Personal Data when you contact us with inquiries, customer support requests, or employment applications.  You do not have to provide us with your Personal Data.  However, if you choose not to disclose certain information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services, such as retaining shopping cart choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also collect the Personal Data of third parties when you provide it to us. For example, if you choose to use our service to send a gift to a friend or register a family member for an account, we will ask you for their name and address or email address. In addition, we may collect third party Personal Data through our "Refer a Friend" program. Cardpool stores this information for the sole purpose of completing the transaction. If you provide Personal Data of a friend or family member and they want us to delete this information, they should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Cardpool.com">privacy@Cardpool.com</a>. We may not always be able to remove their Personal Data and we will let them know if we cannot do so and why.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Personal Data We Collect</h3>
    <p><u>Information You Provide Us</u><br>
    We may collect the following types of Personal Data from you through our Sites and related to our Services, subject to applicable laws</p>

If we cannot collect this data, we may be unable to on-board you as a client or provide products or services to you.</p>

Please only provide us Personal Data that we need in order to respond to your request.</p>

    <p><u>Geolocation</u><br>
    With your consent, we may collect your location-based information such as to help you locate a store offering our products and services in your area.  On some Sites we collect location-based information for fraud prevention purposes.  You may opt out of location-based services at any time by changing the settings on your device.
