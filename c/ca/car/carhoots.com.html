For example, when using our service, if you decide to fill in a contact form to make a general enquiry, should you want to make an additional enquiry then we retain details such as your name and contact number so you don’t have to enter the same details again.</p><p><strong>So, what information do we collect?</strong></p><p>	<strong>a)	Personal Information.</strong> When you register with us through the Service to become a registered User of Carhoots, we will ask you for certain information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”).
