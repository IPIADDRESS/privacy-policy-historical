<h1>Protect Your Privacy and Safety</h1><h3>Effective Date: August 2, 2016</h3><h2>Overview</h2><p>
CareerBuilder, LLC and its subsidiaries and divisions (collectively, "CareerBuilder", "We" or "Our") provides this Privacy Policy to explain our data and security practices and policies on CareerBuilder websites and software applications (collectively, the "Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Information we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. The phrase "Personal Information" refers to information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the
<a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a> for the Sites, which apply to this Privacy Policy. When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a prominent notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the bottom of the notice when it was most recently updated. If we make material changes to the policy that will affect previously collected Personal Information, you will be notified and provided an opportunity to consent to the updated Privacy Policy.

</ul><h3>Information We Collect</h3><p>
The types of information we may obtain include:
</p><ul>
<li>Personal Information provided by you (such as via a resume uploaded to our Site or a job application sent using our Site) or collected from third party sources as described below. </li>
<li>Publically available data about you from third party sites and sources, including profiles created by you on other websites, or other information you have publicly shared for the purpose of advertising or informing others about your background. </li>
<li>Username and password for the account you may establish on our Sites.</li>
<li>Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address) if you buy products on our Sites.</li>
<li>Your demographic information (such as zip or postal code, occupation, education and experience, and if you choose to provide it, age, gender and race or ethnicity). We collect this information either through the registration process, from your resume or in the manner described below. </li>
<li>Job search behavior and preferences, and a record of the searches that you make on our Sites. </li>
<li>Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.</li>
<li>Technical information about your use of our sites or apps, as described below.</li>
</ul><p>
We may obtain information about you from various sources, including directly from you via our Sites, when you call or email us or communicate with us through social media, or when you participate in events, contests or other promotions. We also may obtain information about you from our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, business partners and other third parties, as well as from publicly available information.
</p><p>
Many people invest significant time and energy to promote their professional reputation through public forums on the Internet. We gather information relevant to your career history and work experience from these widely dispersed publicly available sources, including social media sites you may be part of, forming a "Profile." We make this Profile available to independent and company-specific recruiters for recruitment leads in a database known as "Recruitment Edge." Although we may generate a Profile about you based on publicly available information even if you do not have a CareerBuilder account, we also will include the information that you provide to us via your CareerBuilder account. Use of these Profiles are limited to recruitment lead generation and may not be used for determinations about employment or other eligibility. You can learn more about our Recruitment Edge product at our
<a href="http://edge.careerbuilder.com/faq">Edge FAQ Page</a>. If you would prefer that we not compile and make this information available to recruiters, you can opt-out of this service <a href="http://edge.careerbuilder.com/optout">here</a>.
</p><p>
CareerBuilder provides software applications ("Apps") available to the public. If you decide to download one of our Apps, and if you authorize us to do so, we will collect your social media profile information, including your social network site user ID, work email address, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names. You may be asked to enter this information directly, or we can automatically collect it by syncing to your social media profiles. We request this information so that we may automate completion of registration forms or job applications with information stored in your social media profile. In addition, when you visit our Sites or use our Apps, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons or as provided to the app by your device's operating system, as described in more detail
<a href="#cookies">below</a>. The information we may collect by automated means includes:
</p><ul>
<li>Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser and operating system type and other operating system support information).</li>
<li>Pages and URLs that refer visitors to our Sites, also pages and URLs that visitors exit to once they leave our Sites.</li>
<li>Dates and times of visits to our Sites.</li>
<li>Information on actions taken on our Sites (such as page views, site navigation patterns and job view or application activity).</li>
<li>A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our Sites.</li>
<li>Search terms that visitors use to reach our Sites.</li>
</ul><p>
<a href="#top">(Return to Top)</a>

<li>Maintain a record of the jobs you view or apply to on our Sites. </li>
<li>Inform you of relevant job postings that may be of interest to you based on your interests as expressed previously through your job search behavior and preferences. </li>

<li>Contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant services, educational or other career development opportunities); enable you to communicate with us through our blogs, social networks and other interactive media; and solicit your feedback and input. These communications will contain links for preference management and, where appropriate, unsubscribe links should you decide you do not want to receive further communications.</li>
<li>Manage your participation in our events and other promotions, where you have signed up for such events and promotions.</li>
<li>Operate, evaluate and improve our business and the products and services we offer.</li>

</ul><p>
We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Sites (including your internet protocol address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Sites. We collect this information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail
<a href="#cookies">below</a>.
</p><p>
If we seek to use the information we obtain about you in other ways, we will provide specific notice and request your consent at the time of collection.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">(Return to Top)</a>
</p><h3>INFORMATION WE SHARE</h3><p>
We share the information that we collect from you or from third party sources with recruiters, educators and service providers.
</p><p>
Recruiters may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a job with a company through the Sites, the information supplied by you or shared through CareerBuilder products and services may become part of such company's database. Similarly, if your CareerBuilder resume or your Profile is downloaded by a recruiter, your information may become a part of their database. In these instances, the use of such information by the recruiter will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company's use of your information.
</p><p>
Where you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is "hosted" or "co-branded" by another company then that information will be made available to both CareerBuilder and the hosting/co-branding company. CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information. You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.
</p><p>
All users should be aware that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties.
</p><p>
We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.
</p><p>
CareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Sites.
</p><p>
In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">(Return to Top)</a>
</p><h3>ANALYTICS</h3><p>
We may combine certain non-personally identifiable Aggregate Data, or otherwise anonymized or de-identified data about our users and use such data to prepare reports for our users (typically recruiters or educators). "Aggregate Data" is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together. Aggregate Data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals. We may also use and share anonymized or de-identified data to track trends in the labor market as well as use of our products and services. Some Aggregate Data analytics reports can be used to better understand individual Profiles. For example, our Recruitment Edge product provides aggregate data trends on the longevity of specific career positions to allow recruiters to identify Profiles of individuals who may be more likely to be interested in making a career move.
</p><p>
We also use third party analytics services to help better understand the use of our sites, which is further described in the Cookies section
<a href="#cookies">below</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">(Return to Top)</a>
</p><h3>Privacy Options for Resume Database</h3><p>
Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of recruiters with open positions each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.
</p><p>
We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to publicly posting their resume on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 2 levels of resume privacy from which you can choose. Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume is publicly available to third parties. CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose Personal Information, as well as anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
</p><h4>1. Standard Posting on the Searchable Database</h4><p>
This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest recruiter audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database. If you select this option, any registered company (or individual recruiter) user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume).
</p><h4>2. Non-Public Posting</h4><p>
Non-public posting prevents your resume from being searchable by recruiters in the CareerBuilder resume database. The benefit of uploading a non-public resume is that you can quickly and easily apply for specific jobs with the resume that you have on file without retyping your information.
</p><p>
We attempt to limit access to our searchable databases to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to these searchable databases. While we limit access and use of information from our products and services in our Terms and Conditions,
we cannot control the use of information by third parties once they obtain that information from our products and services or other publicly available sources. Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume or to a public website.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">(Return to Top)</a>
</p><h3>Review, Update or Delete Your Account Information or Profile</h3><p>
You may access, update and amend Personal Information included in your online CareerBuilder account or remove your resume from our resume database at any time by logging into your account and making the necessary changes. You may also delete your account, including your Personal Information and any resumes, from our resume database at any time by logging in to your account and making an account deletion request. Deleting your CareerBuilder account will remove your Personal Information and resumes from our resume database. However, it will not delete your Recruitment Edge Profile. You must specifically request the deletion of your Recruitment Edge Profile by opting out
<a href="http://edge.careerbuilder.com/optout">here</a>.
</p><p>
You may also request a copy of your Recruitment Edge Profile to review, edit or update by contacting us at 1.800.891.8880 or emailing
<a href="mailto:clientsupport@careerbuilder.com">clientsupport@careerbuilder.com</a>. Please note that when you request the deletion of your Profile, we will use the email address you provide in the opt-out process to match you to your Profile. Therefore, you will need to submit your request using the email address listed on your Profile or we will not be able to complete your request.
</p><p>
Please be advised that, even in the event of a successful account or Profile deletion, recruiters and others who have paid for access to our databases, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to our databases may have retained a copy of your resume or Profile information in their own files or databases. Additionally, if you have applied to a job at a particular company in the past, that company will still have access to your resume. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or Profiles that have been downloaded by third parties, and, you will not be able to delete data held by third parties that already have accessed and downloaded your Profile information or resume. In addition, we will retain anonymous Aggregate Data for uses described in this privacy policy.
</p><p>
Please allow up to thirty days to process your account or Profile deletion request.

A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon," is also called a
<em>Web bug</em> or a <em>pixel tag</em> or a <em>clear </em><a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/G/GIF.html"><em>GIF</em></a>. Used in combination with <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cookie.html">cookies</a>, a <em>Web beacon</em> is an often-<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/transparent.html">transparent</a> graphic image, usually no larger than 1 <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/pixel.html">pixel</a> x 1 pixel, that is placed on a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_site.html">Web site</a> or in an <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/e_mail.html">e-mail</a> that is used to monitor the behavior of the <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/U/user.html">user</a> visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail.

CareerBuilder uses cookies and other similar technologies for the convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. CareerBuilder also uses cookies to store non-personally identifying information about you such as past jobs viewed and job searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on your computer. We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based on your interests as expressed previously through your searches. Lastly, CareerBuilder uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and efficiency of our Sites. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware, however, that some CareerBuilder features or services may not function properly without cookies.
</p><p>
CareerBuilder permits third party cookies on its Sites. For example, third party tools located on the Sites, including those that allow for social media sharing, may use cookies to remember user preference settings. CareerBuilder also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which use cookies to collect non-personal information about details of our users' visits to the Sites (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Sites. These third party web analytics services provide us with reports based on this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with the Sites.
</p><p>
We use third-party advertising companies who may place or access cookies on your computer hard drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and to keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the webs pages on which the ads appeared. These companies may use information about your visits to these Sites and to other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our Sites or on other, third party, sites. We also may give third party advertisers the ability to tailor their advertisements on our Sites using demographic and preference information we provide to them in aggregate form. This information does not identify you individually.
</p><p>
These companies operate under their own privacy policies and CareerBuilder encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies. CareerBuilder does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers.
</p><p>
Our Site does not respond to web browser "do not track" signals.

</p><h3>Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Recruiters</h3><ul>
<li>You should use your own careful judgment about whether and what information to provide to recruiters.</li>
<li>DO NOT PUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION, such as your Social Security number, on your resume. </li>
<li>If restricted or prohibited by the local laws in the jurisdiction where you reside, do not provide CareerBuilder, or otherwise include in your resumes or Profiles other sensitive information that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, health or sex life, genetic or biometric data, the commission of criminal offences or proceedings or unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties or fines.</li>
<li>CareerBuilder's Sites are open to the public, and we cannot guarantee that all users of our services have a legitimate need to the information they seek. </li>
<li>Do not provide your social security number, national identification number or any state, provincial or other local identification number to any third party via online application. Identity thieves may attempt to trick you into providing sensitive information. Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e., your social security number or any other state or national identification number, eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
<li>Job seekers should never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction of any sort. </li>
<li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country. </li>
