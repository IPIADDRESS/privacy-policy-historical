		<p>CL Educate  ("CL Educate", "Career Launcher", "CLE", "CL", "we", "us" and "our") is committed to treating your personal information with respect and sensitivity. This document of Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how we may collect, store, use, and disclose personal information when you ("you" or "User") access or use</p>
		
		<p>(1) our websites located at www.cleducate.com or www.careerlauncher.com or www.careerlauncheruae.com and all of our other websites to which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the "Website" or "Site"); <br>
(2) our services, products, offerings &amp; programs and courses ("Programs"); and <br>
(3) any services, content, and features made available by us through the Website or the Programs (together with the Website and the Programs, the "Services").</p>

<p><strong>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>By accessing, registering, purchasing or using the Services, you signify that you have read, understood and agreed to be bound by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of purchase and consent to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. The provisions contained in this Privacy Policy supersede all previous notices and statements regarding our privacy practices with respect to the Services. If you do not agree to every provision of this Privacy Policy, you may choose not to access or use the Services. </p>

<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion, subject to applicable laws. When we undertake these revisions, we will post a revised version on the Website. The revised Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting on the Website, unless otherwise set forth therein or as otherwise required by applicable law. Since such changes shall apply to any purchases made after such changes are posted to the Site, you should review these terms prior to each registration / purchase so that you will understand the terms applicable to such transaction. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not make any purchases / register yourself on our Website. </p>

<p>To reiterate, accepting this Privacy Policy, as and when revised, is required for your continued access and use of the Services. Except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your access and use of the Services are subject to the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your access or use of the Services.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE ALSO INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PURCHASE QUALIFICATION - ACCOUNT SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>To make a purchase on any of CL websites, you must comply with the terms set out in this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining the security of, and restricting access to, your account and password, and you agree to accept responsibility for all purchases / registration and other activities that occur under your account. CL reserves the right to refuse or cancel orders at any time in its sole discretion.</p>

<p><strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Services, we may collect information that allows you to be identified (“Personal Data”), and we may also collect information that does not identify you (“Anonymous Information”). When Anonymous Information is, directly or indirectly, associated or combined with Personal Data, such Anonymous Information will be considered Personal Data for purposes of this Privacy Policy. In addition, to the extent Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses or similar identifiers or information are considered personally identifiable information by applicable law, we will treat such identifiers and information as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> In general, you may visit the Website without telling us who you are or sharing any Personal Data with us. However, if &amp; when you register for an account for the Programs (an “Account”), and/or use other aspects of the Programs, and/or communicate with us for customer service or technical support for the Programs, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Data, such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number, date of birth and gender.</p>

<p>You may decline to provide Personal Data to us, but, if you do so, certain Programs, or features of certain Programs, may not be available to you. For example, we sometimes request certain Personal Data to determine whether you are eligible for Services targeted toward particular cohorts. Sometimes, funders or sponsors of our Services require us to provide them with information regarding participants in these Services. Such information could include the contact information and program status of participants, which we would disclose to the funder or sponsor in the form of Personal Data, or the ethnicity, gender or other characteristics of participants, which we would disclose to the funder or sponsor in an aggregated form. In such cases, participation in the Services may be contingent on individuals providing the relevant Personal Data.</p>
<p><br>
  Only the person with the name with which you have enrolled will be allowed to access our&nbsp;<a href="http://aspiration.ai/" target="_blank">aspiration.ai</a>&nbsp;platform and all the offerings that come with it. Also, only those documents which bear the same name will be validated.</p>

<p>If at any point of time we find out that your&nbsp;<a href="http://aspiration.ai/" target="_blank">aspiration.ai</a>&nbsp;account or the content is being viewed or used by anyone else, we reserve the right to terminate your account without any prior intimation.</p>

<p>You can also be requested to mandatorily provide additional Personal Data to us, such as information pertaining to your educational background or personal and professional goals, or other geographical or demographic or biographical information,&nbsp; admit card/score card for the exam that you are appearing in that particular target year which may or may not be associated with your Account.</p>
<p>
  We may ask you whether you want to receive human-controlled-and-operated calls and/or autodialed and prerecorded message calls and/or text messages relating to the Services. If you consent to such use of your phone number for these purposes, you may, if permissible under applicable laws and regulations, receive human-controlled-and-operated calls or autodialed and prerecorded message calls and/or text messages from us, as applicable, relating to the Services, at that number.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected From Devices:</strong> When you access the Services using a computer or mobile device, including a desktop computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, smart watch or other consumer electronic device (each, a “Device”), we may collect information from your Device, such as your Device type and manufacturer, your mobile carrier, your device software version, your Device identifiers, your mobile phone number, your IP address, your browser type, your network connection type, information about the webpage that referred you to the Website or that you visited prior to the Website, and your behavior and activity on the Website.
