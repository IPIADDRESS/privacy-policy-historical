<div class="aboutContentLeftL">
<p class="mb20">CaratLane.com is one of India’s leading e-commerce company and one of the most visible online brands since its inception in October 2008. CaratLane was started with a mission to change the way diamonds and diamond jewellery  is bought in India. In  4 short years, this vision is well on its way to being realized.</p>
<p>Using our virtual DNA, we’ve combined flexibility with 24-carat customer service standards. With a network of over 4000 global vendors, we offer the largest  collection of diamonds &amp; diamond  jewellery in the country. Sparkling solitaires &amp; precious diamond and gemstone jewellery leave our factories daily, to  our delighted customers in more than 150+ cities and towns across the length &amp; breadth of India. Our business model helps our customers save up to 25%  over retail prices.  CaratLane is promoted by professionals who know the diamond jewellery business inside out as well as one of the pioneers of the online industry in India. Like all online businesses, we derive strength from having low overheads and low inventory costs. In addition, we do our own manufacturing and are not just a re-seller like most online businesses. We have a dedicated call centre to help customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutContentLeftR">
<p>Small wonder that CaratLane.com has been listed as one of the “Top 20 hottest e-commerce sites in India” in a Data Quest / Sapient Nitro study. Our website has also been rated the best in Usability/User Interface design.Our footprint is now set to expand. In March 2011, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world invested $6Mn in CaratLane.com. Our next steps can only be bigger and better!</p>

<div class="accordian_body">
<div class="faqcontent">
<p>What is the Best Price Challenge?</p>
<ul>
<li>On Solitaires: We are confident that our prices are significantly lower than retail. We encourage you to check the detailed specifications of the solitaire and also insist on certification from reputed labs like GIA, IGI and HRD. If you are able to find a better priced solitaire with exactly matching specifications (shape, cut, colour, clarity, carat, polish, symmetry, fluorescence, table and depth ) and certificate from the same laboratory, we will match the price or refund the difference if you have already purchased from us. You just need to provide a valid quotation for the diamond from a reputed retailer. The quotation should not be more than 1 week old.</li>
<li>On Gold Coins: If you find a lower price on BIS Hallmarked Gold coins anywhere else, just let us know and we will match the price, or refund the difference on your purchase from CaratLane.com. It's that easy. Of course, the lower price you find needs to be for the same date, weight &amp; purity of the coin. All you have to do is send a scanned copy of the invoice or quotation from the jewellery (where you found the lower price) to sales@caratlane.com and we will do the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our prices are up to 25% lower than other retailers because:</p>

<p class="accordian_head wc10">Conflict free Diamonds</p>
<div class="accordian_body">
<div class="faqcontent">
<p>At CaratLane, we only purchase diamonds through the largest and most respected suppliers who, like us, proudly adhere to and enforce the standards established by the Kimberley Process. All the diamonds that we sell is certified "conflict free", assuring your that our inventory was procured through legal sources. We comply with the Kimberly Process and various other United Nations resolutions and the diamonds we sell are obtained using legitimate means. If one of our suppliers was ever found to be in violation of that process, we would immediately sever that relationship. We will continue to support and promote any process that works to uphold legitimacy in the diamond trade.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict-Free Diamonds - Our Guarantee</strong></p>
<p>Diamonds are mined throughout the world, including major mines in Australia, Africa, Russia and Canada. Diamonds are a major source of good in many African nations, employing and providing healthcare to thousands. For more information on this issue, please visit DiamondFacts.org. Conflict-free diamonds are those gems which were not obtained due to human rights abuses, child labor, violence, or environmental degradation. Although the U.N.'s Kimberly Process only covers diamonds under the control of legitimate and recognized governments, conflict-free goes one step further by rejecting diamonds from governments that trade in diamonds to bankroll their conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Diamonds - Financing Death And Environmental Destruction</strong></p>
<p>Through the 1990s, most of the world's diamonds came from Africa, particularly regions undergoing civil unrest. Rebel armies in parts of Africa were exploiting alluvial diamond fields to fund their wars against established governments, putting people and the environment in the middle of their conflicts. Alluvial diamonds are found just inches to a few feet below the surface, making them easier to mine, but having an adverse impact on the environment. The people working these fields were often very young and subject to exploitation, with some losing their lives or permanently maimed as wars raged around them. Hence, the term blood diamonds to describe these types of gems.</p>
<p><strong>The CaratLane Initiative</strong></p>
<p>At CaratLane, we are doing our part to make sure that our customers receive conflict-free diamonds. Specifically, our internal guidelines exceed government requirements, an initiative that provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CaratLane does not purchase polished diamonds from sources which are not professional members of the diamond trade.</li>
<li>CaratLane has binding contracts with our suppliers which guarantee that the diamonds they offer to us for sale are conflict-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand that our customers care where their diamonds come from and we share that concern with you. By shopping CaratLane.com, we strive to maintain the highest standards including sourcing diamonds from reputable providers.</p>
<p>CaratLane, along with the global diamond industry, has a zero-tolerance policy toward conflict diamonds. Through measures such as the Kimberley Process, which tracks diamonds from mine to market, the industry in partnership with the United Nations, governments, and non-governmental organizations, polices diamond exports to prevent the trade of illegal diamonds.</p>

<div class="confictpolicy">
<p>At CaratLane.com, we only purchase diamonds through the largest and most respected suppliers               who, like us, proudly adhere to and enforce the standards established by the Kimberley Process.               All the diamonds that we sell is certified "conflict free", assuring your that our inventory was               procured through legal sources.</p>
<p>We comply with the Kimberly Process and various other United Nations resolutions and the               diamonds we sell are obtained using legitimate means</p>
<p>If one of our suppliers was ever found to be in violation of that process, we would immediately               sever that relationship. We will continue to support and promote any process that works to               uphold legitimacy in the diamond trade.</p>
<h2>Conflict-Free Diamonds - Our Guarantee</h2>
<p>Diamonds are mined throughout the world, including major mines in Australia, Africa, Russia and               Canada. Diamonds are a major source of good in many African nations, employing and providing               healthcare to thousands. For more information on this issue, please visit DiamondFacts.org.</p>
<p>Conflict-free diamonds are those gems which were not obtained due to human rights abuses,               child labor, violence, or environmental degradation. Although the U.N.'s Kimberly Process only               covers diamonds under the control of legitimate and recognized governments, conflict-free goes one               step further by rejecting diamonds from governments that trade in diamonds to bankroll their conflicts.</p>
<h2>Blood Diamonds - Financing Death And Environmental Destruction</h2>
<p>Through the 1990s, most of the world's diamonds came from Africa, particularly regions undergoing               civil unrest. Rebel armies in parts of Africa were exploiting alluvial diamond fields to fund their wars               against established governments, putting people and the environment in the middle of their conflicts.               Alluvial diamonds are found just inches to a few feet below the surface, making them easier to mine,               but having an adverse impact on the environment. The people working these fields were often very               young and subject to exploitation, with some losing their lives or permanently maimed as wars raged               around them. Hence, the term blood diamonds to describe these types of gems.</p>
<h2>The CaratLane.com Initiative</h2>
<p class="p0">At CaratLane.com, we are doing our part to make sure that our customers receive conflict-free               diamonds. Specifically, our internal guidelines exceed government requirements, an initiative that               provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CaratLane.com does not purchase polished diamonds from sources which are not professional<br> members of the diamond trade. </li>
<li> CaratLane.com has binding contracts with our suppliers which guarantee that the diamonds they<br> offer to us for sale are conflict-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand that our customers care where their diamonds come from and we share that concern               with you. By shopping CaratLane.com, we strive to maintain the highest standards including sourcing               diamonds from reputable providers.</p>
<p>CaratLane.com, along with the global diamond industry, has a zero-tolerance policy toward conflict               diamonds. Through measures such as the Kimberley Process, which tracks diamonds from mine to               market, the industry in partnership with the United Nations, governments, and non-governmental               organizations, polices diamond exports to prevent the trade of illegal diamonds.</p>
