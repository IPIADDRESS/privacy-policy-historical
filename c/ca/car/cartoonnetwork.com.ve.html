</p><p>CartoonNetwork.com is committed to providing a fun, safe and secure website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping parents and children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.  Because many visitors to this site are children, we take care that our content is appropriate for children. In addition, we employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online.  We do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact information.</p>

<p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for parents and 
children, we provide this summary of our information practices. 
This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information 
at CartoonNetwork.com.</p>

<p>As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time.  However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected.</p>


<p><b>I.  The Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>At CartoonNetwork.com, we do not collect personally identifiable information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. For some activities, such online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or a favorite cartoon character. For some other activities, such as entering sweepstakes and subscribing to our e-mail newsletters, we may ask visitors to provide full name and e-mail address. For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend, we may also ask for personal information about other people.  This is usually limited to name and e-mail address.</p>

<p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from Shop.CartoonNetwork.com will be required to provide their full name, billing and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number and a credit card number.  If the order is being shipped to a third party, we will also need the recipient's name and mailing address.  Before collecting information in connection with a Shop.CartoonNetwork.com order, we will verify the validity of the purchaser's credit card.  On occasion, we might solicit additional voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping preferences.</p>

<p>When a child under thirteen enters a contest or sweepstakes, asks to receive an e-mail newsletter, or participates in another activity that requires the use of personal information, we will also ask for a parent's e-mail address so that we can notify the parent that we have received personal information from their child.  We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from children under thirteen without notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their child's name from the entry list.  Contest and sweepstakes winners are notified by e-mail. We do not knowingly collect the mailing address of a child under thirteen without obtaining verifiable consent from that child's parent.</p>

<p>When visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>


<p><b>II.  How We Use the Information</b></p>

<p>We use visitors' personal information for internal purposes only, such as enabling visitors to enter our online contests or sweepstakes, to subscribe to our online newsletter, or to order from Shop.CartoonNetwork.com.  We may also use personal information provided by shoppers at Shop.CartoonNetwork.com to send them, by e-mail or direct mail, notification of special offers, sale events, or birthday reminders. These notifications are sent only to those visitors to Shop.CartoonNetwork.com who ask to receive them.</p>

<p>We use parents' e-mail addresses to notify them when we have received information from their children and to give parents the option to remove their child's name from our lists.  We use information we collect about others only to enable visitors to our site to communicate with those other people, for example, by sending them electronic greeting cards or e-mail.</p>

<p>We do not keep any personal information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes after the particular event is completed.  We only use the names and e-mail addresses of subscribers to our CartoonNetwork.com e-mail newsletter to send them the newsletter.  Each newsletter also includes instructions for subscription removal via return e-mail.</p>

<p>We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide services to our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes or sending prizes to winners.  In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing.</p>

<p>We sometimes use non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site, to personalize our visitors' experience on CartoonNetwork.com, and to offer products, programs, and services.  We also may aggregate this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.</p>

<p>We will disclose information we maintain as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We also may disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.</p>

<p>We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.</p>


<p><b>III.  Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</b></p>

<p>Our site contains links to other sites, including those of sponsors and advertisers, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these sites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on Cartoon Network, CartoonNetwork.com or Shop.CartoonNetwork.com.  Visitors should consult these other third party sites' privacy notices, since these sites are not covered by our privacy policy and may follow different procedures.</p>


<p><b>IV.  Cookies</b></p>

<p>CartoonNetwork.com uses a software technology called "cookies."  Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences.  Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information.  Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of this web site to personal information that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address, we do not use cookies for this purpose.  We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site.</p>


<p><b>V.  Security</b></p>

<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>

<p>We are particularly sensitive to visitors' security concerns regarding the use of credit cards to purchase products over the Internet.  For orders placed on Shop.CartoonNetwork.com, we use a technology that automatically encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted over the Internet, provided that the visitor's browser supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL).</p>

<p>To verify the security of your connection at Shop.CartoonNetwork.com, check the lower left corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server is secure.  You may also check by looking at the URL line of your browser.  When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from http to https.</p>

<p>Parents, please send a letter or postcard to our Cartoon Network Privacy Manager at the mailing address provided below if you would like to do any of the following:</p>

</li></ul>

<p>Please be sure to include your e-mail address and a telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that we collect and maintain about your child.</p>

<p>The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children.  Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites, and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching online experiences.</p>
