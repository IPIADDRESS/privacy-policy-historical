				<p><strong>Last Revision: March 9th, 2009</strong><br>
<br>
CarDomain wants to make it easy for you to understand its information  collection practices.  You are probably sick of the legalese that  companies put in their privacy policies.  We are too.  So we decided to  revise our privacy policy to be in plain English.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../privacy-policy/#what">What  Categories of Information Does CarDomain Collect and How Does it  Typically Use This Information?</a></li>
<li><a href="../privacy-policy/#uses">Can I  Control How CarDomain Uses the Information It Collects?</a></li>
<li><a href="../privacy-policy/#collect">Do  CarDomain’s Advertisers, Vendors, or Business Partners Collect  Information About Me?</a></li>
<li><a href="../privacy-policy/#share">Does  CarDomain Share the Information it Collects With Others?</a></li>
<li><a href="../privacy-policy/#secure">How Secure  Is My Personal Information?</a></li>
<li><a href="../privacy-policy/#children">What  About The Children?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect from  you when you use CarDomain’s websites, services, and applications (the  “Services”) and how we use such information.  By using the Services, you  agree to this policy. We may change or update this policy from time to  time. Any updated policy shall be effective after it is posted.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this policy, write to 3417 Fremont  Ave, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98103 or send email to  privacy[@]cardomain.com.</p>

<h1>What Categories of Information Does CarDomain Collect  and How Does it Typically Use This Information?</h1>
<p>There are three categories of information which we may obtain in the  course of our relationship with you.  These are described below, along  with a description of how we may use such information.  Note: our use of  information is subject to exceptions (e.g., we may disclose Personal  Information in response to a subpoena) which are discussed in the  Section titled “Does CarDomain Share the Information it Collects With  Others?”</p>
<ul>
<li> User Contributed Information.Information you voluntarily post,  upload, or display to other Service users through the Services is “User  Contributed Information”.  For example, the information on your Ride  Page is User Contributed Information.<strong> USE OF USER CONTRIBUTED  INFORMATION</strong>: Our use of this information is straight-forward —  we publish it in accordance with any privacy settings in your account.   However, you should assume that this information will be accessible by  anyone.  By using our Services, you agree that we can use the User  Contributed Information in accordance with this policy and in accordance  with our terms of service.</li>
<li> Personal Information.Information that you provide us when using the  Service which (i) is not provided for publication or display through  the Services and (ii) identifies you by full name, full postal address,  phone number, or email address, or includes information necessary to  process payment for the Service, such as a credit card number,  expiration date and billing address, is “Personal Information.” For  example, you may provide Personal Information such as an email address  when you register to use certain Services.<strong> USE OF PERSONAL  INFORMATION</strong>: We will not reveal your Personal Information to  other Service users unless you authorize it.  We will not sell your  Personal Information or share your Personal Information with others.   Again, we may use Personal Information for the purposes for which it was  provided, such as to process transactions, identify you as an  account-holder, or send you an email.</li>
<li> General Information.”General Information” is information that you<br>
provide us or which we collect which is not Personal Information (e.g.,  information about your computer or browser, or age and gender  information you provide when filling out a survey). For example, we may  collect General Information about your computer (Mac or PC), web  browser, Internet Protocol (IP) address and the date and time of your  visit.  We may use cookies, web beacons and GPS software to collect  General Information.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s  computer tied to information about the user. We may use session ID  cookies to confirm that users are logged in.  Normally, these cookies  terminate once the user closes the browser. We may use a persistent  cookie that stores your login ID to make it easier for you to login when  you come back to use the Service. You may be able to remove or block  this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable  this convenience feature.  A web beacon is a small graphic files used to  determine if a page has been viewed. If you use the Service on a  GPS-enabled mobile device, we may collect the city and state and other  information provided by GPS.<strong>USE OF GENERAL INFORMATION</strong>: We may use General  Information to understand how people use our Services.  We may use  cookies to keep you logged in to your account, track your use of our  Services, or to prevent you from entering the same information  repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Can I Control How CarDomain Uses the Information It Collects?</h1>
<p>You can use many of our Services without submitting User  ContributedInformation.  If you submit User Contributed Information, we  typically allow you to choose how or when we publish User Contributed  Information.  We may send you marketing messages to any email address  you provide us.  You can choose not to receive any marketing email from  us by following the instructions to “unsubscribe” provided in the email.  You can also log in to your account to unsubscribe from receiving  marketing email.</p>
<h1>Do CarDomain’s Advertisers, Vendors, and Business Partners Collect  Information About Me?</h1>
<ul>
<li> Sites we do not own or operate.The Services may contain or link to  features and content on websites we do not own or operate. These  websites may collect information about you, but we do not have control  over their collection practices. If you are visiting a third-party  website, please review its privacy policy.</li>
<li> Advertisers.We may use third-party advertising companies and  networks to serve ads through our Services. These companies and networks  may collect and use General Information to deliver more relevant  advertising to you, and for other business purposes.
