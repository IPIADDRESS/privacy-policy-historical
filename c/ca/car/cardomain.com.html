<h1>CarDomain Network, Inc. - Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Last Revision: March 9th, 2009</h2>
<br>
<p>
CarDomain wants to make it easy for you to understand its information
collection practices.  You are probably sick of the legalese that
companies put in their privacy policies.  We are too.  So we decided
to revise our privacy policy to be in plain English.
</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what">What Categories of Information Does CarDomain Collect and How Does it Typically Use This Information?</a></li>
<li><a href="#uses">Can I Control How CarDomain Uses the Information It Collects?</a></li>
<li><a href="#collect">Do CarDomain's Advertisers, Vendors, or Business Partners Collect Information About Me?</a></li>

</ul>
<br>
<p>
Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect from
you when you use CarDomain's websites, services, and applications (the
"Services") and how we use such information.  By using the Services,
you agree to this policy. We may change or update this policy from
time to time. Any updated policy shall be effective after it is
posted.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about this policy, write to 3417 Fremont Ave, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98103 or send email to
<a href="mailto:privacy@cardomain.com">privacy@cardomain.com</a><a>.

</a><div id="privacy"><a>

</a><h3><a>
</a><a name="what">What Categories of Information Does CarDomain Collect
and How Does it Typically Use This Information?</a>
</h3>

<p>
There are three categories of information which we may obtain in the
course of our relationship with you.  These are described below, along
with a description of how we may use such information.  Note: our use
of information is subject to exceptions (e.g., we may disclose
Personal Information in response to a subpoena) which are discussed in
the Section titled "Does CarDomain Share the Information it Collects
With Others?"
</p>

<ul>
<li>
User Contributed Information.

<br>

Information you voluntarily post,
upload, or display to other Service users through the Services is
"User Contributed Information".  For example, the information on your
Ride Page is User Contributed Information.

<br>

<b>USE OF USER CONTRIBUTED INFORMATION</b>: Our use of this information is
straight-forward -- we publish it in accordance with any privacy
settings in your account.  However, you should assume that this
information will be accessible by anyone.  By using our Services, you
agree that we can use the User Contributed Information in accordance
with this policy and in accordance with our terms of service.
</li>

<li>
Personal Information.

<br>

Information that you provide us when using
the Service which (i) is not provided for publication or display
through the Services and (ii) identifies you by full name, full postal
address, phone number, or email address, or includes information
necessary to process payment for the Service, such as a credit card
number, expiration date and billing address, is "Personal
Information." For example, you may provide Personal Information such
as an email address when you register to use certain Services.

<br>

<b>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>: We will not reveal your Personal
Information to other Service users unless you authorize it.  We will
not sell your Personal Information or share your Personal Information
with others.  Again, we may use Personal Information for the purposes
for which it was provided, such as to process transactions, identify
you as an account-holder, or send you an email.
</li>

<li>
General Information. 

<br>

"General Information" is information that you
provide us or which we collect which is not Personal Information
(e.g., information about your computer or browser, or age and gender
information you provide when filling out a survey). For example, we
may collect General Information about your computer (Mac or PC), web
browser, Internet Protocol (IP) address and the date and time of your
visit.  We may use cookies, web beacons and GPS software to collect
General Information.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's
computer tied to information about the user. We may use session ID
cookies to confirm that users are logged in.  Normally, these cookies
terminate once the user closes the browser. We may use a persistent
cookie that stores your login ID to make it easier for you to login
when you come back to use the Service. You may be able to remove or
block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to
disable this convenience feature.  A web beacon is a small graphic
files used to determine if a page has been viewed. If you use the
Service on a GPS-enabled mobile device, we may collect the city and
state and other information provided by GPS.

<br>

<b>USE OF GENERAL INFORMATION</b>: We may use General Information to
understand how people use our Services.  We may use cookies to keep
you logged in to your account, track your use of our Services, or to
prevent you from entering the same information repeatedly.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="uses">
Can I Control How CarDomain Uses the Information It Collects?
</a>
</h3>

<p>
You can use many of our Services without submitting User Contributed
Information.  If you submit User Contributed Information, we typically
allow you to choose how or when we publish User Contributed
Information.  We may send you marketing messages to any email address
you provide us.  You can choose not to receive any marketing email
from us by following the instructions to "unsubscribe" provided in the
email. You can also log in to your account to unsubscribe from
receiving marketing email.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="collect">
Do CarDomain's Advertisers, Vendors, and Business Partners Collect
Information About Me?
</a>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Sites we do not own or operate. 

<br>

The Services may contain or link to
features and content on websites we do not own or operate. These
websites may collect information about you, but we do not have control
over their collection practices. If you are visiting a third-party
website, please review its privacy policy.
</li>

<li>
Advertisers. 

<br>

We may use third-party advertising companies and networks
to serve ads through our Services. These companies and networks may
collect and use General Information to deliver more relevant
advertising to you, and for other business purposes. For example, if
you conduct a search for a certain type of car, you may see
advertisements for this type of car on your next visit to a CarDomain
website. For more information or to opt-out of receiving targeted
advertising from third-party advertising companies and networks, go to
NetworkAdvertising.org. Also keep in mind that if you enter
information into a form through an advertisement, or visit a Website
depicted in an advertisement, any information you provide may be
provided to the advertiser.  The advertiser's privacy policies may
differ from our policy.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: BlueKai, a third party, uses cookies to collect non-Personal
Information from you when you access the CarDomain website and
Services.  To opt out, click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: We have contracted with Lotame Solutions LLC ("Lotame") to better
 help us operate the website, report website traffic, statistics, advertisement
 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our web sitewebsite. Lotame 
may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile 
anonymous statistics about our website visitors. Lotame does not collect 
personally identifiable information. For more information about how the 
information is collected and used by Lotame, please see Lotame's privacy 
policy at <a href="http://www.lotame.com/privacy/">http://www.lotame.com/privacy/</a>.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="share">
Does CarDomain Share the Information it Collects With Others?
</a>
</h3>

<p>
From time to time we may need to disclose the information subject to
this policy to other people, entities, or government authorities.  For
example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Internal business purposes. 

<br>

We may share information we collect with
third parties to complete transactions you have requested or to
perform services on our behalf. Third parties who perform services on
our behalf are obligated to use the information for the purpose it was
provided.
</li>
<li>
You authorize it. 

<br>

We may disclose your Private Information if you
authorize it. Sometimes, your authorization may be implicit. For
example, if you use our Service to send a message to someone, we will
forward your message to the intended recipient.
</li>
<li>
To protect ourselves or others. 

<br>

We disclose information we collect
when we make the good faith determination that it is appropriate to
comply with the law (e.g., a subpoena or court order); to enforce or
apply this policy, or our other policies or agreements; to initiate,
render, bill, or collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our
users' rights, property, or safety; to protect our users from
fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Services; or if we
reasonably believe that otherwise exigent circumstances require or
justify disclosure of this information.
</li>
<li>
Business transfers. 

<br>

Information about you, including Private
Information, may be disclosed or transferred wholesale as part of any
merger, acquisition, debt financing, or sale of company assets, as
well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership (in
which information could be transferred to third parties as one of our
business assets).
</li>
<li>
Site usage. 

<br>

We may use third-parties to help measure the effectiveness
of our advertising and to analyze usage of the Services. Third parties
may help us analyze General Information we obtain from you (we
generally place restrictions on those third parties' use of such
information).  Our third party analytic partners may use the General
Information for their business purposes, such at to report aggregate,
non-Personal Information about the use of their services and
technologies in connection with the Services.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="secure">
How Secure Is My Personal Information?
</a>
</h3>

<p>
We use reasonable security measures to protect your Personal
Information from unauthorized use and disclosure while in our
control. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect
certain Personal Information, such as credit card information, that is
transmitted over the Internet. However, no security measures are
perfect, and we cannot guarantee that any information we collect will
be secure from unauthorized access or use.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="children">
What About The Children?
</a>
</h3>

<p>
Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 16, or
anyone who is under the age of majority who does not have the consent
of their parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly publish
information for anyone under 16 years old through our Services. If you
