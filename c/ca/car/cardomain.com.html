              <h1>CarDomain Network Respects Your Privacy</h1>

              <p>CarDomain Network, Inc. ("<em><strong>CarDomain</strong></em>") takes
              your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about
              our Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about CarDomain's
              information collection practices, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@cardomain.com">privacy@cardomain.com</a>.</p>

              <h2>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>This Privacy Policy covers CarDomain's treatment of
                information that CarDomain collects when you use or access
                websites or webpages on the CarDomain suite of sites (the
                "<em><strong>CarDomain Network</strong></em>") or when you use
                CarDomain's services offered by CarDomain
                (the "<em><strong>Services</strong></em>"). This policy also
                covers information that CarDomain may collect on a partner's
                site.</li>

                <li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that CarDomain does not own or control,
                or to people that CarDomain does not employ or manage.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>General Rules</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain may utilize personally identifiable user information to
                optimize the user experience. CarDomain may share this information
                with third parties (via an intermediary, which anonymizes this
                information) to analyze user behavior, serve advertisements that are
                tailored to the user's interests, and for other similar purposes.</li>

                <li>CarDomain may provide personally identifiable information to a
                third party who analyzes such information on behalf of CarDomain â€” CarDomain
                will not allow any third party to use personally
                identifiable information except to analyze or anonymize it.</li>

                <li>CarDomain may send you promotional materials provided you consent.
                As a general rule, CarDomain will only send you promotional emails
                which you consent or request to. By consenting to receive CarDomain
                emails or updates you are not signing up to receive any third party
                communications (unless sent on behalf of CarDomain). CarDomain will
                not rent or sell your email address or other personal information.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Information Collection</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain collects personally identifiable information when you
                register for a CarDomain membership, when you sign up for a CarDomain
                email newsletter, and when you enter CarDomain promotions or sweepstakes.
                CarDomain may also receive personally identifiable information from
                business partners.</li>

                <li>Once you register with CarDomain and sign in to our services, you
                are not anonymous to CarDomain.</li>

                <li>CarDomain also automatically receives and records information on
                our server logs from your browser including your IP address, CarDomain
                cookie information and the pages you requested and accessed. This
                information tracks website usage and behavior.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Cookies</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Like many other websites, CarDomain utilizes "cookies". A cookie
                is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing
                information about the user. Usage of a cookie may be linked to
                personally identifiable information. Cookies may be used to enhance
                the user experience. For instance, by setting a cookie, the user would
                not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time
                while accessing the CarDomain Network. If a user rejects the cookie,
                they may still use the CarDomain Network. The only drawback to this is
                that the user will be limited in some areas of the CarDomain Network.
                Cookies can also enable CarDomain to track and target the interests of
                users to enhance the user experience.</li>

                <li>CarDomain may set and access cookies on your computer.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Log Files/IP Addresses/Browsing History</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain may use log files, IP addresses, and browsing history and
                information to analyze trends, administer the CarDomain Network, track a
                user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
                use. Some of this information may be shared with third parties - these
                third parties (except for the entity which "anonymizes the data") will
                only use or have access to the information in anonymized form.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain may share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address,
                email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our website or offline with
                us though a third-party advertising partner and its service providers, which will merge that
                information with information gathered from other sources in order to deliver to you banner
                advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites.
                Our advertising partner will make the data we provide it anonymous and will only use the data in
                its anonymized form. Only the intermediary data provider which anonymizes the data comes into
                contact with any personal information. To choose not to have this information used by our
                third-party advertising partner, click <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.</li>

                <li>CarDomain will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Third
                party advertising partners may use anonmyized user information for purposes of publishing
                CarDomain advertisements as well as for their own purposes.</li>

                <li>CarDomain may send or disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties:
                  <ul>
                    <li>with your consent;</li>

                    <li>when necessary to provide the product or service you have requested;</li>

                    <li>when necessary to send the information to companies who work on behalf of CarDomain to
                    provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have
                    any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is
                    necessary to assist us);</li>

                    <li>who then anonymize it and provide it to advertising partners to use for advertising
                    purposes;</li>

                    <li>who analyze it on behalf of CarDomain;</li>

                    <li>in response to a subpoena, court order or other legal process;</li>

                    <li>when CarDomain determines that your actions potentially violate the CarDomain Terms of
                    Service, Code of Conduct, or any of our other usage guidelines or rules; or</li>

                    <li>when CarDomain determines that such action is reasonably necessary to avert or mitigate any
                    action taken by you that is contrary to CarDomain's interests.
                  </li></ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Subpoenas</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain may disclose any of your information (including personally identifiable information
                and browsing information, to the extent available) to law enforcement or in response to a
                subpoena.</li>

                <li>CarDomain will endeavor to contact you and allow you an opportunity to object to this
                disclosure, but sometimes this is not practicable or not allowed by law enforcement.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Links</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>The CarDomain Network contains links to other websites. CarDomain is not responsible for the
                privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the
                CarDomain Network and to read the privacy statements of each and every website to learn how such
                website collects and uses personally identifiable information.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Newsletter</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>You may subscribe to the CarDomain newsletter or other content/promotions, by entering the
                requisite information (your name and email address). By subscribing, you agree to receive the
                CarDomain email newsletter which may or may not include special offers or incentives from select
                partners. You waive any rights under any state or federal law regulating unsolicited advertising,
                including but not limited to, the CAN-SPAM Act. Again, we do not rent or lease your email address
                to third parties who wish to send you unsolicited email/advertisements.</li>

                <li>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials, you may opt-out of
                receiving these communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link appearing at the end of any
                email newsletter communication. You may also email <a href="mailto:remove@cardomain.com">remove@cardomain.com</a>.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Surveys and Contests</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>From time-to-time CarDomain may request information from users or members via surveys or
                contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user or
                member has a choice whether or not to disclose or provide any information. Information requested
                may include contact information (such as name, email) demographic information (such as age, zip
                code). Unless we inform you to the contrary in advance, we will only use this information for
                marketing purposes and to improve the quality of our products and services - we will not rent or
                lease this information to third parties (i.e., to allow them to market to you).</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain allows users or members to refer friends or third parties to the CarDomain Network -
                i.e., CarDomain offers a referral service through which members and users can inform a friend
                about CarDomain and the CarDomain Network. CarDomain will send the person whom you refer one (1)
                one-time email inviting them to visit the CarDomain website. CarDomain uses the person's email
                address for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Your Ability to Edit/Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain gives you the ability to edit your Account Information and preferences at any time,
                including whether you want CarDomain to contact you about specials and new products.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Security</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Your CarDomain Network Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and
                security. In certain areas CarDomain uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data
                transmission. You should carefully safefguard your user name, password, and any log-in
                information.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>CarDomain may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes
                to this policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the CarDomain Network, sending
