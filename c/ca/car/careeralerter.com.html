You may contact Career Alerter at 2312 Park Ave #408, Tustin, CA 92782 USA or via our <a href="contact.php">contact form</a>.</p>
        <p>By using the Career Alerter website, or submitting information to us by other means, you are subjecting your information to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers Career Alerter's treatment of personal information that we collect when you are on Career Alerter's website and when you use Career Alerter's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Career Alerter does not own or control, including websites that we may link to, or to individuals that Career Alerter does not employ or manage.</p>
        <h4>Privacy Policy Updates</h4>
        <p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Career Alerter may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Career Alerter will post its updated Privacy Policy on our website located at www.careeralerter.com. Career Alerter encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to Career Alerter will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>To the extent you upload a resume, Career Alerter may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties, including but not limited to employers and search engines.
