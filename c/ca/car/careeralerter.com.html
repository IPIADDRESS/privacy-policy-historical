        <h2>Career Alerter Privacy Policy</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Updated 2014</h4>
        <p>Careeralerter.com ("Career Alerter") takes your privacy very seriously and has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. You may contact Career Alerter at 2312 Park Ave #408, Tustin, CA 92782 USA or via our <a href="contact.php">contact form</a>.</p>
        <p>By using the Career Alerter website, or submitting information to us by other means, you are subjecting your information to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers Career Alerter's treatment of personal information that we collect when you are on Career Alerter's website and when you use Career Alerter's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Career Alerter does not own or control, including websites that we may link to, or to individuals that Career Alerter does not employ or manage.</p>
        <h4>Privacy Policy Updates</h4>
        <p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Career Alerter may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Career Alerter will post its updated Privacy Policy on our website located at www.careeralerter.com. Career Alerter encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to Career Alerter will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>Information Collection</h4>
        <p>Career Alerter may collect or receive information about you when you register or submit information, including, but not limited to, username, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, resume and contents thereof, job search history, and any other data included in a submitted profile, resume, or search.

        <p>To the extent you upload a resume, Career Alerter may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties, including but not limited to employers and search engines. This means that the personal information contained in your resume can be viewed by third parties and you may receive unsolicited contact from third parties unaffiliated with Career Alerter. Career Alerter will make reasonable effort to safeguard the use of your personal information by third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Career Alerter reserves the right to disclose any information as required by law. </p>
