        <h2>Career Alerter Privacy Policy</h2>
        <hr>        
        <h4>Updated April 5, 2011</h4>
        <p>Careeralerter.com ("Career Alerter") takes your privacy very seriously and has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. You may contact Career Alerter at 15143 Woodlawn Avenue, Tustin, CA 92780 USA or via our <a href="contact.php">contact form</a>.</p>
        <p>By using the Career Alerter website, or submitting information to us by other means, you are subjecting your information to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers Career Alerter's treatment of personal information that we collect when you are on Career Alerter's website and when you use Career Alerter's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Career Alerter does not own or control, including websites that we may link to, or to individuals that Career Alerter does not employ or manage.</p>
        <h4>Privacy Policy Updates</h4>
        <p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Career Alerter may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Career Alerter will post its updated Privacy Policy on our website located at www.careeralerter.com. Career Alerter encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to Career Alerter will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>Information Collection</h4>
        <p>Career Alerter may collect or receive information about you when you register or submit information, including, but not limited to, username, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, resume and contents thereof, job search history, and any other data included in a submitted profile, resume, or search. Career Alerter also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers. Career Alerter may also record actions taken on our site including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. Career Alerter may store this information in its equipment or the equipment of third party technology providers.</p>
		<h4>Use of Information</h4>
        <p>Career Alerter, or companies we partner with, may contact you based on your interests such as job postings and career development opportunities. Career Alerter's site may require you to provide Career Alerter with contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information. Career Alerter may use your contact information to (a) send you job alerts; (b) create an account; or (c) send you information about Career Alerter and promotional material from some of Career Alerter's partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. Career Alerter may use demographic and/or profile data, including but not limited to search history, to tailor your experience on Career Alerter's site, show you content that Career Alerter thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. </p>
        <p>To the extent you upload a resume, Career Alerter may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties, including but not limited to employers and search engines. This means that the personal information contained in your resume can be viewed by third parties and you may receive unsolicited contact from third parties unaffiliated with Career Alerter. Career Alerter will make reasonable effort to safeguard the use of your personal information by third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Career Alerter reserves the right to disclose any information as required by law. </p>
        <p>We may use other companies as necessary to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Every effort will be made to safeguard your privacy when it may be accessed by other companies, including but not limited to technology providers; however, Career Alerter will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. </p>
        <p>Career Alerter may use your IP address to administer our site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and to gather broad demographic information. Nothing shall restrict Career Alerter from maintaining your data following your termination of your use of Career Alerter's site. Career Alerter may delete your user data at Career Alerter's sole discretion.</p>
        <h4>Facebook Information Collection and Use</h4>
        <p>Through our use of Facebook products and services, including but not limited to Facebook Connect and Facebook Platform, we may receive personally identifiable information about you and your friends who are registered on Facebook ("Friend").

        <h4>Protect Yourself</h4>
        <p>Career Alerter uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site.

        <p>Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer. Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a potential employer. Always be cautions of opportunities that sound too good to be true or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.</p>
