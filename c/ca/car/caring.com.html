<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Last Updated: May 7, 2014</h2>

<p>Caring.com, a part of Bankrate, Inc. has created this Privacy Policy to let you know what we do with the personal information you submit to us via forms and the non-personal web usage information we collect when you visit our websites. This Privacy Policy applies to Caring.com and all of its trade names, including but not limited to GilbertGuide.com and Caring.com, henceforth referred to collectively as "Caring.com."</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. Caring.com has prepared these privacy and security policies ("Statement") so you may better understand how Caring.com ("our website") may use your personal information in connection with our website and services, as well as how it protects your information against unauthorized use. Please take the time to review this Statement and contact us using the Contact Information below with any questions or concerns.</p>

<h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong>
You may submit to Caring.com personal information that identifies you as an individual when you choose to interact with us on our website. Personal information that you may submit includes your name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number. In some cases, you may also submit demographic information such as your age, gender, zip code, level of education, household income, and interests. If we combine demographic information with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information as set forth in this Privacy Statement. In some cases, you may provide additional information including when you choose to personalize your use of our website for medical conditions of interest, when you ask a question of our experts, or when you contact our customer support group.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information Provided When Requesting Information on Senior Care Services or Facilities ("Senior Services Provider")</strong>
On the Caring.com website, you will find web forms where you are requested to submit personal information in order to receive information from Senior Services Providers (such as assisted living facilities or home-care providers).  When you submit your personal information via such forms, you are providing consent to Caring.com to contact you via the phone number and/or e-mail address you have submitted.  Additionally, you are providing consent to us to convey the information you have provided to the Senior Services Provider that you have identified or, in some cases, to other Senior Service Providers that may meet your needs.  Such Senior Services Providers may contact you directly and will protect your personal information in accordance with their own privacy and information security policies.</p>

<p><strong>Children's Personal Information</strong>
Caring.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If we find out that we have such personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.</p>

<p><strong>Website Usage Information</strong>
 Caring.com collects non-personally identifiable information such as navigational data (log files, server logs, click-stream) and information about how our website is used by you (through cookies or web beacons, etc.). We also collect information such as the URL of the website you previously visited and the time of day that you use our website. Caring.com also keeps track of the pages you visit within our website. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent, or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but in such cases many features of our website will not function as designed.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Ad-Serving Companies</strong>
 On our website, we will display third-party advertisements. We allow third-party ad-serving companies or ad networks to display advertisements on our website. Some of these ad networks may set a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Thus, third party ad-serving companies or ad networks may compile information about where you are using your computer, where you saw their advertisements, and which ads you clicked on. This information allows the third party to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Caring.com does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad-serving companies or ad networks. We will not share information that will specifically identify you to an ad-serving company.</p>

<h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong>
Caring.com uses the personal information that you submit to help enhance and personalize your use of our website. This information also allows us to provide you with relevant content, information, and advertising (on our website, in newsletters, via e-mail, etc.).</p>

<p>When you respond to an offer of information or a service on Caring.com (for example, by completing an online form), Caring.com may use that information to connect you to a specific provider or with a trusted partner who will provide the information or service that you requested.</p>

<p>Caring.com may also use your personal information to respond to your inquiries via phone and/or e-mail, send you service e-mails with important information regarding our website and related services, and to send you newsletters and offers.</p>

We use anonymous and aggregated data to create statistics and reports for various business purposes. We may aggregate anonymous data and share it with our advertisers or Caring.com partners in order to offer you potentially desirable content, products, and services.</p>

<p>The website usage information we collect is used by Caring.com to monitor and improve the operation, technical functions, and quality of our website and services.
