With all visits to CareerBeacon, however, we do track your IP address to gather broad demographic information about you, including your location, the domain name you used to access CareerBeacon, the type and version of browser you are using, and your Internet Service provider.

This information is used by CareerBeacon to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views and other general statistics about CareerBeacon in order to improve our services and does not include any information which could personally identify any of our users.  Apart from the collection of this anonymous information, you will always know when CareerBeacon is collecting personal and other information from you and, consequently, you may decline to provide such information at any time.<br><br>

The notifier service (the "Notifier Service") is made available to users who have logged on to MyBeacon.  To subscribe to the Notifier Service, you must provide your e-mail address, establish a password and specify your language capabilities.  You must also select the province(s) in which you are seeking employment and to specify the employment categories that apply to you.  Once you have subscribed, we will advise you, via e-mail, of employment opportunities that fall within the criteria you have specified.  You may unsubscribe to or deactivate our Notifer Service at any time by using the applicable online function.  <br><br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send to a Friend</strong><br><br>
All of CareerBeacon's employment postings have a "Send to a Friend" option.

<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying for Employment Opportunities Posted on CareerBeacon™ - Personal Profiles, Resumés and Cover Letters</strong><br><br>
CareerBeacon offers a quick and convenient service to registered users who wish to electronically apply for employment opportunities posted on CareerBeacon.  In order to use this service you must register and complete a personal profile.   The personal profile includes your first name, last name, e-mail address, province or state and country.  You may also choose to complete optional personal profile information fields.  After completing your personal profile, you proceed to submit, finalize and post your resumé on CareerBeacon.  You control the content of your resumé, including the amount of personal information contained therein.  Typically, a resumé will include your full name, contact information, a summary of your work experience, education and relevant skills, and other information that may be of interest to Employers.  Finally, you may also elect to post a cover letter on CareerBeacon, the content of which you also control.  In addition to retaining control over the content of your resumé and cover letter, you also control which Employers are provided with your personal profile, resumé or cover letter.  This information is not made available to any Employers unless you directly and voluntarily choose to make it available by applying for a specific employment posting on CareerBeacon.  You may log on to CareerBeacon and modify your resumé or cover letter at any time.  When you elect to electronically apply for posted employment opportunities via CareerBeacon and forward your personal profile, resumé and cover letter to an Employer through this service, you should expect that the entire content of your application materials, as provided, will be reviewed and that this information may be retained by those Employers who receive it for their own use.  Before accessing the personal profile, resumé and cover letter service, you will have to specifically indicate your acceptance of the terms upon which CareerBeacon will collect, use and disclose the information 
you are submitting as described in this Privacy Policy by clicking "Accept" where indicated or using such other method to indicate your acceptance as may be presented.       <br><br>

At CareerBeacon, we use "cookies" to help measure the volume of visits to CareerBeacon, the average time spent using our services per visit, page views and other general statistics.  Cookies are simple text files that Internet browsers are configured to automatically place on computer hard drives when websites are visited.  Cookies cannot damage files, nor can they read information from your hard drive.  By placing cookies on your hard drive, CareerBeacon is able to recall specific information from your earlier visits, thus enabling you to avoid the inconvenience of re-entering certain data each time you visit CareerBeacon.  Adjustments can be made to most Internet browsers which enable you to decline all cookies or, alternatively, to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

<strong>USE OF INFORMATION </strong><br><br>
The information that we collect and that is posted by you on CareerBeacon is used to provide you with our services, to assist us with making improvements to such services and to communicate with you regarding new developments and changes to our services.  CareerBeacon aggregates certain demographic information that we gather from you and others in order to facilitate our evaluation of the use and success of our services.

Although CareerBeacon has implemented mechanisms to ensure that your personal profile, resumé and cover letter is only accessed by authorized Employers to which you have chosen to provide such personal and other information, we cannot guarantee that all such Employers will adhere to the limits that we impose on the use of such information through contractual and other means, or that unauthorized users will not gain access to CareerBeacon.  Although we take all reasonable steps to safeguard your privacy, our control over the manner in which Employers retain and use your personal information is limited.  We caution that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password you have chosen to access services offered by CareerBeacon.  We encourage you to frequently change this password as a further means of protecting your personal information.  <br><br>
<strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION </strong><br><br>
The personal information you provide to us will be disclosed to authorized users of CareerBeacon as described in this Privacy Policy.  CareerBeacon will not sell, share or rent the information that you provide to third parties in any manner except as set out in this Privacy Policy.  CareerBeacon reserves the right to disclose your personal information to companies that we contract with and individuals that we employ to carry out functions on our behalf only to the extent required to carry out such functions.  In addition, circumstances may arise in which CareerBeacon may have an obligation to disclose your personal information to comply with the law, prevent a crime or protect our own interests.  CareerBeacon may also disclose your personal information to third parties who acquire all or a significant part of our business, including by merger, amalgamation or sale of assets.<br><br>
<strong>UPDATING/RETAINING/DELETING INFORMATION </strong><br><br>
CareerBeacon takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal or other information you provide to us is accurately displayed as provided.

You may terminate your CareerBeacon account at any time and erase your personal profile, resumé and cover letter by sending an e-mail request to us. However, certain personal information may continue to remain accessible to Employers if the information, such as your name and e-mail address, was collected and stored in individual Employer accounts prior the date of such termination.  CareerBeacon also retains archived account information, such as your name and e-mail address, that is not made available to any users.  <br><br>
We have developed and implemented guidelines for managing personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the purposes identified or that is no longer required or permitted by law to be retained.  We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, subject to the retention of archived account information, as described above.  <br><br>
We offer you the opportunity to opt-out or discontinue receiving communications from CareerBeacon, including our Newsletter Service and Notifier Service using the applicable online function.<br><br>
<strong>SECURITY</strong><br><br>
