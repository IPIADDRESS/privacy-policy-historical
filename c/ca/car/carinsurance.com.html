      Security<br></strong> This document was last updated January 21, 2004. 
      </p>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and to 
      developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online 
      experience. Please read the complete CarInsurance.com privacy statement. 
      </p>
      <p>By using CarInsurance.com, you consent to the data 
      practices described in this statement. We will ask you when we need 
      information that personally identifies you (personal information) or 
      allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when 
      you are requesting a quote, new policy, servicing a policy, or giving us 
      feedback about CarInsurance.com products. Personal information collected 
      by CarInsurance.com often is limited to e-mail address, language, country, 
      or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a 
      service you requested. </p>
      <p>We collect information about you to quote and service 
      your insurance policy. Depending on the product, we may collect this 
      information from external sources. <br>Consumer Report Information: We 
      obtain this from consumer reporting agencies. It may include your driving 
      record, claims history with other insurers, and credit report information. 
      The information is kept by the consumer reporting agencies and disclosed 
      by them to others as permitted by law. <br>Transaction Information: This 
      is information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others. 
      It may include your insurance coverages and rates, and payment and claims 
      history. It also may include information that we require for billing and 
      payment. <br>Web Site Information: This information is unique to Internet 
      transactions. It may include the Web site you visited before ours, your 
      computer operating system, and the pages you viewed on our site. Some of 
      our Web sites may also store "cookies" on your computer. Cookies save 
      certain information entered by you on our Web sites. They also collect 
      technical data, like your Internet protocol (IP) address, operating 
      system, and session ID. We will share information about you only as 
      permitted by law. </p>
      <p>We restrict access to your information to our employees 
      and others who we feel must use it to provide our products and services. 
      Their use of the information is limited by law, our employee code of 
      conduct, and written agreements where appropriate. We also maintain 
      physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your 
      information. </p>
      <p>When you visit CarInsurance.com, we use the information 
      we collect to provide services to you. We also use it to understand what 
      you want so that we can enhance your online experience. Information that 
      does not identify you, or that you give us for contests and surveys, may 
      be used for marketing purposes. </p>
      <p>When you quote or buy insurance on CarInsurance.com, we 
      collect your e-mail address so that we can send you e-mails concerning 
      your transactions with us, and other information we think you will find 
      useful. We will also use your e-mail address to provide occasional updates 
      about our products and services. Your e-mail address is your user ID. 
      </p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to protect your password, 
      computer, and email account. Your user ID (e-mail address) AND password 
      allows access to your personal information on our site. To ensure you get 
      our e-mails, our service provider or we may receive confirmations when you 
      open them or click through e-mail links. These confirmations may also show 
      whether your e-mail application supports graphics, so we can tailor our 
      messages to you. We will not share this information or your e-mail address 
      with other companies for their marketing purposes without your consent. 
      </p>
      <p>We designed our systems to provide privacy, integrity, 
      and authentication in Internet transactions. Our security measures help 
      ensure that your data is secured and encrypted, so that others cannot 
      access it while in transit. We limit access to our servers and require 
      CarInsurance.com employees to adhere to high standards of ethics and 
      integrity in performing their jobs. We use a secure server and security 
      protocol to safeguard information you provide during the purchase process. 
      Our secure server uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to interact 
      with you when you provide personal information during the purchase 
      process. We handle your information via 128-bit encryption. Every secure 
      page on CarInsurance.com has a digital certificate by Thawte. This is 
      shown via the site certificate that resides on all secure pages. To view 
      this certificate, click on the image of the "closed lock" or the "solid 
      key" on the bottom of your browser window. A small frame displaying site 
      security information will appear. Click on "subject" to verify that you 
      are on a CarInsurance.com site. Click on "Issuer" to verify the site 
      certification authority. </p>
      <p>Our Web site contains links and redirects to other 
      sites that are not maintained by us. These links are solely for your 
      convenience. We make no warranties or representations about other Web 
      sites. We recommend that you read the privacy and security policies of 
      these sites. </p>
      <p>CarInsurance.com will occasionally update this privacy 
      statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the 
      top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this Statement, 
      CarInsurance.com will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web 
      site. </p></div>
