       Statement of Privacy</b><br>
       <i>This document was last updated October 22, 2002.</i><br>
       <br>
       We are committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology 
       that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. You can 
       travel through most of our site without giving us any information about 
       yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that 
       you request, and this statement of privacy explains data collection and 
       use in those situations. Please read the complete CarInsurance.com 
       privacy statement. By using CarInsurance.com, you consent to the data 
       practices described in this statement.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Collecting your Personal Information</b><br>
       We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you 
       (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this 
       information is requested when you are requesting a quote, service or 
       giving us feedback about CarInsurance.com products. Personal information 
       collected by CarInsurance.com often is limited to e-mail address, 
       language, country or location, but may include other information when 
       needed to provide a service you requested.<br>
       <br>
       <b>Use of your Personal Information</b><br>
       We use your personal information for these primary purposes: </p>
       <ul>
         <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your 
         personal information more than once. </li>
         <li>To help you quickly find quotes, services or information on 
         CarInsurance.com. </li>
         <li>To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Information collected on CarInsurance.com may be shared within 
       CarInsurance.com, including its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. 
       We use other companies on this site and you may be giving information to 
       them and not to CarInsurance.com. Additionally, we occasionally hire 
       other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including 
       quoting and answering customer questions about products or services. We 
       will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver 
       the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any 
       other purpose.<br>
       <br>

       for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the 
       purposes stated above. We don't not control all information given on this 
       site. Some quoting companies are used as a service on this website and
