<h1>CarInsurance.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy</strong><br />
Welcome to CarInsurance.com,  a website owned by Car Insurance.com, Inc. We are committed to respecting your  online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management  of any information you share with us by using our web sites.<br />
CarInsurance.com  has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care  with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the  overall privacy practices of CarInsurance.com regarding information we collect  on our network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums,  including but not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy  also describes the specific privacy practices regarding information you  voluntarily disclose while taking advantage of the insurance-quoting services  on www.carinsurance.com. This policy does not apply to the practices of  companies that CarInsurance.com does not own or control, or to people that CarInsurance.com  does not employ.<br />
<strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong><br />
California has  passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to  California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be  used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that  discloses a customer’s personal information (as defined by the act) to any  third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for  obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone  who might have received that personal information. <br />
If you are a  California resident you may request this information from CarInsurance.com or  any of its affiliates by writing to us via email at info@CarInsurance.com.com or  you may send us correspondence at the following address: CarInsurance.com,  Attn: Privacy, 950 Tower Lane, 6th Floor, Foster City, CA 94404. CarInsurance.com  is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from a customer per  calendar year.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by CarInsurance.com</strong><br /><br />
<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong><br />
CarInsurance.com  collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and to  provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is  collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your  computer which can identify your operating system and session ID) or other  Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or  Internet session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you  are using, your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP  address and the URL you saw just before coming to the CarInsurance.com site,  the pages of the site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon  leaving the site. If you take advantage of our insurance-quoting services, we  may also use web beacons, which allow our partners to place a cookie on an end  user’s computer when they visit one of our partner sites so that when the end  user visits our sites, that cookie data is tracked by our partner and our  partner can identify that the end user achieved a certain milestone (a commonly  used concept also referred to as “pixel tracking”).<br />
CarInsurance.com  may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve ads  on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to  collect your non-personally identifiable information. We have no access to or  control over these cookies, and this policy does not cover the use of cookies  by any advertisers.<br />
<strong>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong><br />
In addition, at  some of the CarInsurance.com websites, we collect information that you may  choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from  one or more of our clients. Examples of personally identifiable data that you  may provide to us include name, address, and email address. If you provide  personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have your  information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other  than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth  below.<br />
Where you  provide your personal information to us to receive an auto insurance quote,  this information may include phone number, social security number, marital  status, date of birth, gender, occupation, education level, driver’s license  number, prior insurance coverage, vehicle identification number (VIN), make,  model and number of vehicles on your household.<br />
<strong>How Collected Information is Used</strong><br />
The  non-personally identifiable information that CarInsurance.com collects is used  for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other  content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The  information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help  determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for  different individuals. If you take advantage of our insurance-quoting services,  we may also provide non-personally identifiable information about your use of  our websites to quoting aggregators, participating insurance carriers and our  business partners. <br />
If you elect to  provide CarInsurance.com with personally identifiable information, we may  utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in  follow-up communications from CarInsurance.com and from our clients. In  addition, that information may be combined with information collected from  other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors,  and for other CarInsurance.com sales and marketing efforts. <br />
If you provide  your personal information to us to receive an auto insurance quote, we may  utilize such information for the following purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Online Interview. In order to take       advantage of the services on our Sites you must provide certain Personal       Information to us during the online client interview process       (“Interview”). Personal Information is used to facilitate your requests       for insurance quotes or applications. </li>
<li>Offline Interview. If you take       advantage of our services through our call center with one of our licensed       insurance agents, your Personal Information will be collected during such       offline interview (“Interview”) and incorporated into our electronic       system so we can fulfill the products/services selected by you. </li>
<li>Post-Interview Information.       Additional Personal Information, such as method of payment and social       security numbers will be collected from you during the post Interview       process in order to fulfill any orders for services or products made by       you. </li>
<li>Transaction Information. Your       Personal Information may be collected and used by us to track transactions       conducted on our Sites including which products/services you selected and       information we require for payment. </li>
<li>Sweepstakes and Surveys. You will       be asked to disclose Personal Information if you elect to participate in       any sweepstakes or surveys we offer on the Sites from time to time. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong><br />
All personally  identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by CarInsurance.com.  There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and  non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as  described below.<br />
Your  non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of CarInsurance.com  on an anonymous basis.<br />
When you  request information from CarInsurance.com or one or more of our clients, we may  transfer that information within CarInsurance.com or route your information to  our client(s), across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other  countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they may provide the  information on their product or service that you requested.<br />
We may also  disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar  services as the original service about which you requested more information. In  such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such  sharing. Please be aware that CarInsurance.com is very careful in selecting  companies with whom it does business.<br />
In addition to  the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is  also the possibility that CarInsurance.com, or part(s) of the company, may one  day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such  transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all  collected personally identifiable information.<br />
If you provide  your personal information to us to receive an auto insurance quote, such  information will be shared with the following third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance Carriers. An insurance       carrier and/or an independent insurance agency appointed by an insurance       carrier will use your personal information in combination with other       information you provide about your insurance needs to create an insurance       premium estimate. Ratings criteria vary between participating providers,       with each carrier placing emphasis on particular items of information you       provide. Please Note: Third party insurance carriers have their own       privacy policies and we are not responsible for these policies nor the       products and/or services offered by third party providers so please make       sure to review the privacy policy of any third party carrier from whom you       may purchase a policy.</li>
<li>Financial, Credit and Government       Agencies. In order to provide you with our services, and only where       permitted by law, we share your personal information with: (1) financial       service providers who provide comparative rates; (2) certified credit       bureaus to verify information about your credit report; (3) Department of       Motor Vehicles to verify your driving record, previous claims history,       vehicles and VIN and other relevant information. Your personal information       is maintained by credit agencies and disclosed by them to others as       permitted by law.</li>
<li>Service Providers. Sometimes third       party service providers are retained or utilized by us and may have access       to our visitors' personal information. This information is required in       order to generate accurate and bindable insurance rates. Please be aware,       while we take steps to protect third party use of Personal Information       through confidentiality agreements and restrictions on access to and use       of such information, there is no means for us to police the activities of       third parties' use of Personal Information disclosed to them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, CarInsurance.com  may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order, to  cooperate with government and law enforcement officials, protect our company's  rights and/or property, investigate reports of visitors providing false or  misleading information, protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our sites  and/or service, prevent or investigate reports of credit card fraud or  unauthorized use, or during emergencies, such as when we believe someone's  physical safety is at risk. <br />
<strong>Security</strong><br />
Wherever your  personally identifiable information may be held within CarInsurance.com or on  its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the  information you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please  note that while CarInsurance.com will make every reasonable effort to protect  your information, no transmission of data over the Internet is 100% secure.<br />
If you provide  your personal information to us to receive an auto insurance quote, we encrypt  such information by using advanced encryption technology known as Secure Socket  Layer (SSL) to protect the transfer and storage of your personal information.  In addition, during the Interview process, you are on secure pages of our sites  and a lock or key icon appears on the bottom of your web browser screen. With  regard to physical security, the personal information you provide to receive an  auto insurance quote is restricted to CarInsurance.com’s and its affiliate’s  United States offices, whose employees are only granted access on a  need-to-know basis. In addition, the servers on which we store such personal  information are kept in a secure environment. Such servers are operated from a  dedicated Internet hosting facility with state-of-the-art physical security  features, including smoke detection and fire suppression systems, motion  sensors, and 24x7 secured access, as well as video camera surveillance and  security breach alarms. <br /></p>

Some of our web  sites utilize cookies to collect information about your website activities and  to recall the personal information you previously shared with us. Most browsers  allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how  to remove them.<br />

You may choose  whether or not to provide personally identifiable information to CarInsurance.com.  If you choose to provide such information to CarInsurance.com, you have the  right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such information described  herein or may have such information deleted in its entirety.

If you provide  your personal information to us in an Interview process to receive an auto  insurance quote, you may also opt-out by clicking on the “contact us” link in  our application. Please be aware that each Interview is considered a new  visitor session. This means that if you opt-out during the Interview you will  not receive any email from CarInsurance.com.

Also, if you  provide your personal information to us in an Interview process to receive an  auto insurance quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Correct or Change Your       Quote Information. You can access the quote information you provided and       update it at any point during the Interview by navigating to previous       pages and making the necessary changes. Upon completing the Interview, you       may review and/or modify your personal information and/or email address by       selecting the “modify” button on the rates page and get a revised quote       reflecting the changes you have made. When you save your quote information,       you can return to the Sites and change your information at anytime as long       as you have not yet purchased a policy. Simply log onto the Sites, select       the applicable insurance for which you requested a quote, and select       Retrieve My Quote. To change your information type the new data and click       the Continue button.</li>
<li>Editing Your Personal Information.       If your personal information or email address changes or you want to edit       or update your information you can do so by emailing our Customer Support,       or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information       listed below. </li>

<ul>
<li>Implementing Change Request. We       will use reasonable efforts to make the changes you requested but it is       not always possible to modify database information. In addition, if your       personal information and email address has been provided to third parties,       we will not be able to make changes to it. Further, such information is       never completely removed from our database due to technical constraints       and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect       that all of your personal information would be removed from our database       in response to your request.</li>
<li>Live Chat. We provide a live chat       feature on our Sites. When used during business hours, this feature does       not collect any personally identifiable information. When used after       business hours to send us a message, this feature collects your name and       email address. We use this information to communicate with you regarding       your inquiry. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Matters</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Third Party Links</strong><br />
In some states,  or for certain lines of coverage (including, but not limited to, homeowners or  renters coverage, pet health coverage, auto coverage) we may provide direct  links to insurance company or agency web sites if we cannot obtain comparative  quote information. If you purchase insurance from these third party carriers as  a result of visiting our sites the carrier may share your personal information  with us regarding the policy which is purchased and related information but we  will not share the information with unaffiliated third parties. Please Note:  when you purchase third party products and/or services from third party web  sites, you become their customer and are subject to their privacy policies.  Please be aware that CarInsurance.com, Inc. is not responsible for third party  privacy practices even if our name or logos appear on third party sites. We  encourage you to review these companies' privacy policies and only do business  with those who adhere to personal information practices with which you are  comfortable.<br />
<strong>Do Not Share Disclosure</strong><br />
