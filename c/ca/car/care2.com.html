Personal and Demographic Information:
</b>
Care2 asks for personal 
  information, such as your name, email address, street address and zip code. Your 
  personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to
allow you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply
additional information for special site services such as Meet Members, Biorhythms,
Petitions and Stock Portfolios.  Care2 may also ask for demographic  information,
such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly
collect information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a
child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's
information from the data base.

we require personal information (such as name, mailing address, credit card
number). We use this information to ship products to you and confirm the
validity of your credit card. We do not sell this information to any
third-party. We do provide your mailing address to a third-party provider of
Care2 apparel (T-shirts, Sweatshirts, etc.) so that these items can be mailed
to you. We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties.

Your ecommerce and Charter Member transactions are conducted on a secure server
using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when
confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to
the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

We will not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after
processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number
from our servers. We retain your address information to ensure that users
receive merchandise provided for various charter membership levels and in case
we opt to send you additional gifts in the future. Without explicit permission,
we will not use any addresses gathered through our Charter Member store except
for order processing.

<b>
Advertising:
</b>
Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic 
  information is to provide our members with the most personalized
web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to 
  reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver 
  more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and
hence better service, to you. 
  
<p>
In delivering targeted online advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. 
    Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they 
    want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad
server partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those
criteria.  In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser can access
individuals' account information. 
  
 
</p><p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads 
    when you visit our web site. These companies may use information 
    (not including your name, address, email or telephone number)
about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide
advertisements 
    on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest 
    to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our 
    third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique
"cookie" 
    on your browser. If you would like more information about this
practice 
    and to know your choices about not having this information use by 
    these companies, 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cookie.html">
click here</a>.  Advertisers may also use "clear gifs" to track advertising page views, but
this information is not connected to personal information collected by Care2.
  
  
</p><p>
Advertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide 
    revenues for donations for Wildlife Conservation.

Biorhythm Generator:
</a>
</b>
The biorhythm generator is a Care2 feature that plots graph results of an
individual's intellectual, physical and emotional biorhythm cycles based on the
individual's birth date. To use the feature, users enter their birth date and
the date for which they wish to view results. This information is only used for
the Biorhythm feature. The graph results are intended to inform and entertain. 
Care2 does not share or disclose the birth date or graph information with any
other party and is used only for immediate display for the person entering
his/her information.

<a href="http://www.care2.com/community/cafe/">
Care2 Café Discussions:
</a>
</b>
To post messages to the Care2 Café discussion boards, users must be Care2
members and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 username will
appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. The username is required to
ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The username
is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed
to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail
address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box
that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when
another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive
these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before
posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile
will appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because, your discussion
postings and member profile will be publicly available, Do NOT include
personal information.

</p></li><li>
<b>
<a href="http://www.petitionsite.com">
PetitionSite:
</a>
</b>
Care2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan PetitionSite.com.  Petition and
Public Comment signers are required to provide certain personal information
such as name, email address and often street address.  This information is
required to validate the petition / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a
signature database to provide data integrity and ease of use.  Your email
address, street address, phone number and other specific contact information
will not be available to either the petition creator or petition recipient,
unless specifically stated during the petition signing process.  During the
signing process, you may opt to receive certain email newsletters and online memberships, in
which case Care2 will send required contact information to those 3rd party
providers.  However, unless you specifically opt to receive such online offers or send
your contact information to 3rd parties during the signing process, Care2 will
keep your email address information confidential.

<a href="http://www.care2.com/send/categories">
E-Cards:
</a>
</b>
When sending e-cards, Care2 requires your email address and the name and email address of the intended e-card
recipient. Care2 will not use the recipient's email address for any reason
other than sending the greeting card notification intended by the sender. 
  
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
E-Mail:
</b>
To provide Care2 members email service, Care2 relinquishes to its email provider, MailCentro, your first and last name, user
name,  Care2 email address, and an encrypted password that serves as a
proxy for your actual password (Care2 does not relinquish your actual
password, except on rare occasion as required to provide customer support to an
individual). MailCentro does not use the user's information for any other
purpose than to set up and maintain their free email account.
  
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
Newsletters
</b>
Care2 offers a variety of Care2 and 3rd party newsletters.  If you opt to
receive one or more newsletters via a check box or by clicking on a specially
marked subscribe link, Care2 will send the required contact information to
those 3rd party providers.

: Members and visitors may participate in the Races without entering personal
information. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other Race
participants, users must join the Race. Care2 members are automatically
enrolled in the Races and hence their Race user name and password is the same
as their Care2 user name and password. New visitors become Race participants by
creating logins and passwords and an e-mail address, which is used to send Race
participants optional Race updates and customer service communications. 
<p>
When Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site
visits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using a
template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation
containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is
entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or
sell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants
will also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be
disabled using the "account settings" page on the Race web site. Through the
unique url, members' friends' Race site visits are tracked and credited to the
member using the unique url. Sending the url in personal e-mail or posting it
in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2
specifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not
know. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation
statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted hourly, listed by the member's
chosen Care2 login. The posted information for the top 100 Racers includes the
number of visits to the Race for the Rain Forest and Big Cats sites and the
number of acres the individual has helped protect.

To set up a mock stock portfolio in Care2.com's

area, users must be Care2 members. To access their stock portfolio, users must
login by using their Care2 username and password. Care2 does not share user
login information with its financial content provider -- Stockpoint. Instead,
when Care2 member's input their user name and password, Care2 generates a
unique identifier that allows Stockpoint to display a Care2 member's stock
portfolio when requested by the member without knowing any personal information
about the member. The user can choose to supply the site with additional
information to use some of the Stock Portfolio's additional features. This
information will only be used for Stock Portfolios.

Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe 
in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or 
property of Care2.  Care2 may also disclose your email address in some limited circumstances (e.g., when you request an opt-in newsletter or
sign-up for e-centives), but this is specifically described to you when we collect the information.   If you choose to sign up for an e-centives account, we will send e-centives your name, zip code, email address, gender, and age. E-centives uses this information to offer you 
targeted coupons and savings.  E-centives states that they will not sell or
distribute this information; however, Care2 cannot guarantee to the user that e-centives will abide by
their <a href="http://www.e-centives.com/servlet/ecentives/ehtml/privacyPage">privacy policy</a>.
We may also provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you
about offers from Care2 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may also match user information with 
third-party data.  Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated 
user statistics (for example, X% of our users are female) in order to 
describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other 
third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

What is "Heightened Security"?
</b></a>
       
</p><p>
The "<a href="/accounts/ac-security.html">
heightened security</a>" 
option is an account management tool that allows you to set privacy 
controls. If enabled, heightened security ensures that no one can
search 
for your login information and view it online.

Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?
</b></a>
       
</p><p>
No, unless you request them. Currently, Care2 offers several direct e-mail
subscriptions describing our site progress, new features, news and
announcements. If you do not want to receive these occasional mailings, simply
opt out of them when registering to become a member. If you elect to receive a
newsletter but later change your mind, go to your MyCare2 page and change your
preferences by unsubscribing to the newsletter.  Each emailing will also
contain unsubscription information in the email footer.  Regardless of the
above, Care2 may send occasional important updates regarding a member's
account, critical service announcements, etc.  It is anticipated that such
mailings will occur only one or two times per year. Care2 also offers several
opt-in mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and several
newsletters from commercial entities.  If you elect to receive any of these
newsletters, some personal information including your name and email address
will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the
newsletter. The user should beware that by opting-in to either the nonprofit or
commercial newsletter offerings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and
control the user information sent out.

<p>
Yes, 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cookie.html">
cookies</a> are used on Care2 in two ways.
       
</p><p>
(1) We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your 
account information (stored on our computers) to deliver a better and 
more personalized service to you. 
       
</p><p>
(2) Advertising networks serving ads onto Care2 may also use cookies. 
Care2 has no control over information collected by advertising
networks 
nor can we access this information.

If you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, you may be unable

What tracking technologies does Care2 use?

</b>
       
<p>
In addition to cookies (see above), Care2 tracks information via database
records and "clear gifs" that allow Care2 to know if a web page has been
viewed. 
</p><p>
If you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, this will also disable
database tracking of personalized statistics such as click-to-donate race
clicks, and you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require
your user name, such as accessing your email account, viewing member profiles,
and changing your user preferences.

Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?
</p>
       
</b>
       
<p>
Not without your direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/spam.html">
SPAM</a>
.
       
</p><p>
As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner
newsletters, e-centives,
or commercial newsletters.   When you opt to receive a newsletter via Care2, we
will send your email address and necessary demographic information to the
newsletter publisher.  Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee
paid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer.  Care2 will never offer
newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your personal information to,
organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers.   
</p>
With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message 
sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages
that 
might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do 
not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have
specifically opted to receive such communications.

Why does my IP address show on the cards I send?
       
</b>
       
</p><p>
The reason we include your IP address* is because Care2 is not intended 
as an anonymous e-mail / card service. Such systems are open to
abuse, 
and including the IP is one step we take to discourage such
inappropriate 
behavior. Additionally, all sends and pickups, including IP numbers, 
dates and times are recorded and stored. It's unfortunate this is
needed, 
but the bottom line is that we require our customers to respect the 
privacy and rights of other members of the web community and we act 
to uphold this standard. 
       
</p><p>
There really is not much of a privacy concern by displaying the IP 
on your card. First, your IP is included with every e-mail you've
ever 
sent. Second, most people's IP addresses are dynamic - meaning they 
change each time you click on something, so anyone tracking down an 
IP number would need to know the exact time the IP address was
captured. 
Third, it would cost so much, and would require so much legal work to 
get the Internet Service Providers to release the customer name, that 
it is basically worthless to anyone but law enforcement officials.

us at support@earth.care2.com.

* Your "IP Address" is the numeric address of the server (Internet

How does Care2 secure its data storage?
</p>
       
</b>
Care2's servers are located at a world-class co-location facility in
California, USA.  The facility has some of the most powerful physical security
systems in the business, from advanced smoke detection and fire suppression
systems to 24/7 secured access with motion sensors, video camera surveillance,
and security breach alarms.  Only certain Care2 employees are given access to
the building.  Access to the database is protected by a firewall and secure
data lines and available only to certain Care2 employees on an as-necessary
basis.

What are the privacy standards for the Green Thumbs-Up and the TopMoxie software used to run it?</b>
</p>
       


Care2 has partnered with TopMoxie to provide you with the Green Thumbs-Up. TopMoxie is the only browser companion that places complete control of privacy issues in the hands of the consumer. The service does not collect any personally identifiable information from users and therefore ensures privacy protection and end-user anonymity.<br><br>
Once you download the Green Thumbs-Up, you will receive customized offers to support your cause while you shop online. TopMoxie performs partner-defined tasks based on your web activity and preferences. We do not collect any personally identifiable information. The information in the Green Thumbs-Up is encrypted and stored on your computer, so it is protected and in your possession.<br><br> 
Since the Green Thumbs-Up includes both a client (software) and server (network) component, Green Thumbs-Up does communicate with your computer on a regular basis. Green Thumbs-Up retrieves various offers for you from our server and stores them on your computer so that they are ready for you when you visit a web site where that offer would be appropriate. In addition, Green Thumbs-Up self-updates to ensure system compatibility. <br><br>
The only data TopMoxie transfers from your computer to their servers is a log of the Green Thumbs-Up product performance which they analyze in aggregate to enhance the service. TopMoxie may also share aggregate data with Care2. There is nothing in TopMoxie service, data collection or business analysis that relates to you as an individual. <br><br>
And the limited data TopMoxie does store on their servers is physically locked up and protected by a firewall for safety. <br><br>
In the future, we may offer additional TopMoxie services. In each such case, you will need to proactively opt-in to the additional services. Some of these services may require personal information. You will be notified at the time you opt-in to any such services that we are collecting new information. <br><br>
<b>Changes to our Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement</b><br><br>
As we add functionality to TopMoxie, we may make changes to our Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement. In some cases, you might be required to actively 'accept' the new Privacy Policy in order to continue using TopMoxie. 
We will also continue to prominently publish our corporate Privacy Policy on our Web site (www.topmoxie.com). If our Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not – without your permission -- use the information that we received from you in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the Privacy Policy that was in effect when the information was collected. <br><br>
<b>Use of Cookies</b><br><br>
The TopMoxie software does not place cookies (standard Internet technology wherein a small piece of data is stored by your browser on your computer) on your system. The TopMoxie Web site does use a session cookie. We compile standard Web log information such as user IP addresses, browser type, browser versions, and operating system versions to understand market demand. 
We do not combine our Web log analysis with data stored on your PC in any way.

<b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b>
<p></p>
       

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
       information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or 
       in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. 
       In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly
accessible, 
       you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Furthermore, 
       while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot
ensure 
       or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the 
       Internet, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Care2 partners 
       and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2
have 
       separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has 
       no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or
actions. 
       The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your 
       passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
responsible 
       whenever you're online.
