							Personal and Demographic Information:

						 Care2 asks for personal

						            personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to
						allow 
						            you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply
						additional information for special site services like Meet Members, Biorhythms,
						Petitions and Stock Portfolios. This information is only used for the specific
						service chosen by the user.  Care2 may also ask for demographic  information,
						such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly
						collect information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a
						child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's

						validity of your credit card. We do not sell this information to any
						third-party. We do provide your mailing address to a third-party provider of
						Care2 apparel (T-shirts, Sweatshirts, etc.) so that these items can be mailed
						to you. We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties.

						Your ecommerce and Charter Member transactions are conducted on a secure server

						receive merchandise provided for various charter membership levels and in case
						we opt to send you additional gifts in the future. Without explicit permission,
						we will not use any addresses gathered through our Charter Member store except
						for order processing.

							Advertising:
						</b>
						 Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic 
						            information is to provide our members with the most personalized
						web 
						            experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to 
						            reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver 
						            more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and
						hence 
						            better service, to you. 
						            
						<p>
						 In delivering targeted advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. 
						              Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they 
						              want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad
						server 
						              partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those
						criteria. 
						              In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser – can access
						individuals' 
						              account information. 
						            
						           
						</p><p>
						We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads 
						              when you visit our web site. These companies may use information 
						              (not including your name, address, email or telephone number)
						about 
						              your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide
						advertisements 
						              on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest 
						              to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our 
						              third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique
						"cookie" 
						              on your browser. If you would like more information about this
						practice 
						              and to know your choices about not having this information use by 
						              these companies,

						this information is not connected to personal information collected by Care2.

						 The biorhythm generator is a Care2 feature that plots graph results of an

						the date for which they wish to view results. This information is only used for

						 To post messages to the Care2 Café discussion boards, users must be Care2

						appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. The username is required to
						ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The username
						is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed
						to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail
						address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box
						that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when
						another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive
						these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before
						posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile
						will appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because, your discussion
						postings and member profile will be publicly available, Do NOT include
						personal information.

						address, street address, phone number and other specific contact information
						will not be available to either the petition creator or petition recipient,
						unless specifically stated during the petition signing process.  During the

						creating logins and passwords and an e-mail address, which is used to send Race
						participants optional Race updates and customer service communications. 
						
						<p>
						
						When Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site
						visits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using a
						template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation
						containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is
						entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or
						sell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants
						will also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be
						disabled using the "account settings" page on the Race web site. Through the
						unique url, members' friends' Race site visits are tracked and credited to the
						member using the unique url. Sending the url in personal e-mail or posting it
						in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2
						specifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not
						know. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation
						statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted hourly, listed by the member's
						chosen Care2 login. The posted information for the top 100 Racers includes the
						number of visits to the Race for the Rain Forest and Big Cats sites and the
						number of acres the individual has helped protect.

					 Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe

					sign-up for e-centives), but this is specifically described to you when 
					          we collect the information.   If you choose to sign up for an
					e-centives account, we
					  will send e-centives your name, zip code, email address, gender, and age. 
					E-centives uses this information to offer you 
					  targeted coupons and savings.  E-centives states that they will not sell or

					  however, Care2 cannot guarantee to the user that e-centives will abide by

					  Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may match user information with

					          user statistics (for example, X% of our users are female) in order to

					 No, unless you request them. Currently, Care2 offers several direct mailing
					subscriptions describing our site progress, new features, news and
					announcements. If you do not want to receive these occasional mailings, simply
					opt out of them when registering to become a member. If you elect to receive a

					contain unsubscription information in the email footer.  Regardless of the
					above, Care2 may send occasional important updates regarding a member's
					account, critical service announcements, etc.  It is anticipated that such
					mailings will occur only one or two times per year. Care2 also offers several
					opt-in mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and several
					newsletters from commercial entities.  If you elect to receive any of these
					newsletters, some personal information including your name and email address
					will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the
					newsletter. The user should beware that by opting-in to either the nonprofit or
					commercial newsletter offerings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and
					control the user information sent out.

						Why does my IP address show on the cards I send?
						        
					</b>
					 
					        
					</p><p>
					 The reason we include your IP address* is because Care2 is not intended 
					          as an anonymous e-mail / card service. Such systems are open to
					abuse, 
					          and including the IP is one step we take to discourage such
					inappropriate 
					          behavior. Additionally, all sends and pickups, including IP numbers, 
					          dates and times are recorded and stored. It's unfortunate this is
					needed, 
					          but the bottom line is that we require our customers to respect the 
					          privacy and rights of other members of the web community and we act 
					          to uphold this standard. 
					        
					</p><p>
					 There really is not much of a privacy concern by displaying the IP 
					          on your card. First, your IP is included with every e-mail you've
					ever 
					          sent. Second, most people's IP addresses are dynamic - meaning they 
					          change each time you click on something, so anyone tracking down an 
					          IP number would need to know the exact time the IP address was
					captured. 
					          Third, it would cost so much, and would require so much legal work to 
					          get the Internet Service Providers to release the customer name, that 
					          it is basically worthless to anyone but law enforcement officials.
