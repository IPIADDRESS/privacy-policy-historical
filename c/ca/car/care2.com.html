Does Care2 ask for credit card information? When?

</p>
      
<p>
Care2 allows you to use your credit card to become a 
<a href="https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html">Care2 Charter Member</a>.
We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties. Your
transaction is conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five
digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company
during order processing.

</b>
       
</p><p>
       
</p><ol>
<li>
<b>
Personal and Demographic Information:
</b>
Care2 asks for personal 
  information, such as your name, email address, street address and zip code. Your 
  personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to
allow you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply
additional information for special site services such as Care2 Connect, Biorhythms, and 
Petitions.  Care2 may also ask for demographic  information,
such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly
collect information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a
child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's
information from the data base.
<p>
When you register to become a 
<a href="https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html">Care2 Charter Member</a>, we require personal information (such as name, mailing address, credit card
number). We use this information to ship products to you and confirm the
validity of your credit card. We do not sell this information to any
third-party. We do provide your mailing address to a third-party provider of
Care2 apparel (T-shirts, Sweatshirts, etc.) so that these items can be mailed
to you. We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties.
</p><p>
Your ecommerce and Charter Member transactions are conducted on a secure server
using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you
input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when
confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to
the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
</p><p>
We retain your address information to ensure that you receive merchandise provided for the appropriate charter membership level and in case
we opt to send you additional gifts in the future. Without explicit permission, we will not use any addresses gathered through our Charter Member store except for order processing.
  
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
Advertising:
</b>
Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic 
  information is to provide our members with the most personalized
web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to 
  reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver 
  more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and
hence better service, to you. 
  
<p>
In delivering targeted online advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. 
    Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they 
    want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad
server partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those
criteria.  In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser can access
individuals' account information. 
  
 
</p><p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads 
    when you visit our web site. These companies may use information 
    (not including your name, address, email or telephone number)
about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide
advertisements 
    on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest 
    to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our 
    third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique
"cookie" 
    on your browser. If you would like more information about this
practice 
    and to know your choices about not having this information use by 
    these companies, 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cookie.html">
click here</a>.  Advertisers may also use "clear gifs" to track advertising page views, but
this information is not connected to personal information collected by Care2.
  
  
</p><p>
Advertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide 
    revenues for donations for wildlife conservation and other charities.

<a href="http://www.care2.com/biorhythms/">
Biorhythm Generator:
</a>
</b>
The biorhythm generator is a Care2 feature that plots graph results of an
individual's intellectual, physical and emotional biorhythm cycles based on the
individual's birth date. To use the feature, users enter their birth date and
the date for which they wish to view results. This information is only used for
the Biorhythm feature. The graph results are intended to inform and entertain. 
Care2 does not share or disclose the birth date or graph information with any
other party and is used only for immediate display for the person entering
his/her information.
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
<a href="http://www.care2.com/community/cafe/">
Care2 Café Discussions:
</a>
</b>
To post messages to the Care2 Café discussion boards, users must be Care2
members and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 name and/or user name will
appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. Login is required to
ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The name
is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed
to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail
address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box
that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when
another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive
these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before
posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile
will appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because, your discussion
postings and member profile will be publicly available, Do NOT include
personal information. 
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
<a href="http://www.petitionsite.com">
PetitionSite:
</a>
</b>
Care2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan PetitionSite.com.  Petition and
Public Comment signers are required to provide certain personal information
such as name, email address and often street address.  This information is
required to validate the petition / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a
signature database to provide data integrity and ease of use.  Your email
address, street address, phone number and other specific contact information
will not be available to either the petition creator or petition recipient,
unless specifically stated during the petition signing process.  During the
signing process, you may opt to receive certain email newsletters and online memberships, in
which case Care2 will send required contact information to those 3rd party
providers.  However, unless you specifically opt to receive such online offers or send
your contact information to 3rd parties during the signing process, Care2 will
keep your email address information confidential. 
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
<a href="http://www.care2.com/send/categories">
E-Cards:
</a>
</b>
When sending e-cards, Care2 requires your email address and the name and email address of the intended e-card
recipient. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not share or sell the e-mail addresses entered by card senders.   
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
E-Mail:
</b>
To provide Care2 members email service, Care2 sends its email service provider, MailCentro, Inc., your first and last name, user
name,  Care2 email address, and an encrypted password that serves as a
proxy for your actual password (Care2 does not relinquish your actual
password, except on rare occasion as required to provide customer support to an
individual). MailCentro does not use the user's information for any other
purpose than to set up and maintain the email account.
  
<p>
</p></li><li>
<b>
Newsletters
</b>
Care2 offers a variety of Care2 and 3rd party newsletters.  If you opt to
receive one or more newsletters via a check box, submit button or by clicking on a specially
marked subscribe link, Care2 will send any required contact information to
those 3rd party providers.

<a href="http://www.care2.com/connect/">Care2 Connect:</a>
</b>
Care2 Connect (C2C) is an optional part of Care2 that facilitates new connections between members.  Care2 will be launching an enhanced version soon, so the following information covers not yet available, as well as currently available, systems.  C2C is accessible only among Care2 members who have personal profiles.  Your personal contact information such as your email address and street address will be kept hidden from the public, and made visible only to you and individuals you have indicated are your friends.   The C2C directory helps members locate their friends, and potential friends, by displaying first name, last name, city and other information on search results - but it does not include contact information per the aforementioned limitations. Contact can be initiated for "non-friends" by using an anonymous messaging system that will not reveal either party's address.

When submitting a profile, you have the option of including information such as: your name, city, state, and country of residence, birthdate, gender, hobbies, interests, expertises, occupation, business, homepage url, email address, marital status, marital status, personal quote, photos, etc.  Remember: Because, much of this information will be publicly available, do NOT include confidential information.   Your personal friends network will be populated based on known relationships you have with other C2C members, as established through use of communications services on the Care2 system and as you specifically indicate while using C2C. Your friends network will be visible to other C2C users, and the privacy of each person is protected as described herein.
<br><br>
Care2 Connect members can elect to invite friends to join using an invitation template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link is sent to each person whose email is
entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or
sell the e-mail addresses entered by Care2 Connect members.
<br><br>
Members can remove themselves from the C2C system at any time by adjusting their account settings via their <a href="http://www.care2.com/accounts/manageaccount.html">My Account Page</a>. Some changes may take up to 24 hours to appear on the site.

: Members and visitors may participate in the click-to-donate Races without entering personal
information. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other Race
participants, members must be logged in while visiting the Race. Care2 members are automatically
registered for each race the first time they click on the free donation button while logged-in. New visitors can become Race participants after
registering for a Care2 account.
<p>
When Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site
visits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using an invitation template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is
entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or
sell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants
will also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be
disabled using the "account settings" page on the Race web site. 

If a friend joins a Race using an invitation url, Care2 records the friend relationship and gives credit to the friend's "upline" for each click.  Sending the url in personal e-mails or posting it in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2
specifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not
know. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation
statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted more frequently on each race.

Will Care2 disclose any of my personal information?

</p><p>
Care2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or 
property of Care2, or as necessary to provide personalized Care2 member services.  Care2 may also disclose your personal information, including name and contact information in some limited circumstances such as when you specifically opt to receive a 3rd party newsletter.  We may also provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under confidentiality agreements.  These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
Under confidentiality agreements, Care2 may also match user information with 
third-party data.  Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated 
user statistics (for example, X% of our users are female) in order to 
describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other 
third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

What is "Heightened Security"?

For your convenience, we provide a way for you to recover a lost password or user name via a webpage.  The "<a href="/accounts/ac-security.html">
heightened security</a>" option is an account management tool that disables that recovery feature. If you enable heightened security, no one (including yourself) can search for your login information and view it online.

Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?
</b></a>
       
</p><p>
No, unless you request them. Care2 offers a variety of direct e-mail
subscriptions describing our site progress, new features, news and
announcements. If you do not want to receive these occasional mailings, simply
opt out of them when registering to become a member. If you elect to receive a
newsletter but later change your mind, go to your My Account page and change your
preferences to unsubscribe from the newsletter.  Each emailing will also
contain unsubscription information in the email footer.  Regardless of the
above, Care2 may send occasional important updates regarding a member's
account, critical service announcements, etc. to all registered members. It is anticipated that such
mailings will occur only a few times per year.  To stop all service announcements, you must delete your account. You may do so by following <a href="/accounts/delete_this_account.html">this link</a> to verify your identity. Care2 also offers 
opt-in mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and
newsletters from commercial entities.  If you elect to receive any of these
newsletters, some personal information including your name and contact information will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the
newsletter. The user should beware that by opting-in to either the nonprofit or
commercial newsletter offerings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and
control the user information sent out.

Does Care2 use cookies?

<p>
Yes, 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cookie.html">
cookies</a> are used on Care2 in two ways.
       
</p><p>
(1) We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your 
account information (stored on our computers) to deliver a better and 
more personalized service to you. 
       
</p><p>
(2) Advertising networks serving ads onto Care2 may also use cookies. 
Care2 has no control over information collected by advertising
networks 
nor can we access this information.

What tracking technologies does Care2 use?
</p>
       
</b>
       
<p>
In addition to cookies (see above), Care2 tracks information via database
records and "clear gifs" that allow Care2 to know if a web page has been
viewed. 
</p><p>
If you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, this will also disable
database tracking of personalized statistics such as click-to-donate race
clicks, and you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require
your user name, such as accessing your email account, viewing member profiles,
and changing your user preferences.

Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?
</p>
       
</b>
       
<p>
Not without your direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise 
<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/spam.html">SPAM</a>. 

</p><p>
As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner
newsletters or other commercial offers.   When you opt to receive such an offer via Care2, we
will send your email address and other necessary contact information to the
newsletter publisher.  Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee
paid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer.  Care2 will never offer
newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address information to,
organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers.   

</p><p>
Why then do some people receive spam at an account they have only used on Care2? Either the spammer did "random combinations" of letters/numbers to guess the address, the member sent someone an email message that somehow got distributed, or perhaps someone entered their address by mistake somewhere else. Bottom line, if it came from a known spammer, we had nothing to do with it - spam is bad, we hate it, and we would never associate ourselves with spammers.
       

</p>
With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message 
sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages
that 
might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do 
not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have
specifically opted to receive such communications.

How does Care2 secure its data storage?
</p>
       
</b>
Care2's servers are located at a world-class co-location facility in
California, USA.  The facility has some of the most powerful physical security
systems in the business, from advanced smoke detection and fire suppression
systems to 24/7 secured access with motion sensors, video camera surveillance,
and security breach alarms.  Only certain Care2 employees are given access to
the building.  Access to the database is protected by a firewall and secure
data lines and available only to certain Care2 employees on an as-necessary
basis.

What are the privacy standards for the Green Thumbs-Up and the TopMoxie software used to run it?</b>
</p>
       


Care2 has partnered with TopMoxie to provide you with the Green Thumbs-Up. TopMoxie is the only browser companion that places complete control of privacy issues in the hands of the consumer. The service does not collect any personally identifiable information from users and therefore ensures privacy protection and end-user anonymity.<br><br>
Once you download the Green Thumbs-Up, you will receive customized offers to support your cause while you shop online. TopMoxie performs partner-defined tasks based on your web activity and preferences. We do not collect any personally identifiable information. The information in the Green Thumbs-Up is encrypted and stored on your computer, so it is protected and in your possession.<br><br> 
Since the Green Thumbs-Up includes both a client (software) and server (network) component, Green Thumbs-Up does communicate with your computer on a regular basis. Green Thumbs-Up retrieves various offers for you from our server and stores them on your computer so that they are ready for you when you visit a web site where that offer would be appropriate. In addition, Green Thumbs-Up self-updates to ensure system compatibility. <br><br>
The only data TopMoxie transfers from your computer to their servers is a log of the Green Thumbs-Up product performance which they analyze in aggregate to enhance the service. TopMoxie may also share aggregate data with Care2. There is nothing in TopMoxie service, data collection or business analysis that relates to you as an individual. <br><br>
And the limited data TopMoxie does store on their servers is physically locked up and protected by a firewall for safety. <br><br>
In the future, we may offer additional TopMoxie services. In each such case, you will need to proactively opt-in to the additional services. Some of these services may require personal information. You will be notified at the time you opt-in to any such services that we are collecting new information. <br><br>
<b>Changes to our Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement</b><br><br>
As we add functionality to TopMoxie, we may make changes to our Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement. In some cases, you might be required to actively 'accept' the new Privacy Policy in order to continue using TopMoxie. 
We will also continue to prominently publish our corporate Privacy Policy on our Web site (www.topmoxie.com). If our Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not – without your permission -- use the information that we received from you in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the Privacy Policy that was in effect when the information was collected. <br><br>
<b>Use of Cookies</b><br><br>
The TopMoxie software does not place cookies (standard Internet technology wherein a small piece of data is stored by your browser on your computer) on your system. The TopMoxie Web site does use a session cookie. We compile standard Web log information such as user IP addresses, browser type, browser versions, and operating system versions to understand market demand. 
We do not combine our Web log analysis with data stored on your PC in any way.

<b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b>
<p></p>
       

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, Care2 Connect, or  in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.   In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly
accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Care2 partners and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2 have separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or
actions. The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're online.

Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy but will notify
