Care2 allows you to use your credit card to become a <b><a href="https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html">Care2 Charter Member</a>.</b> We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties. Your transaction is conducted on a secure server using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.  Care2 does not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number from our servers. 
</p><p>

        <b><a name="how"></a> 
        </b><p><b>How Does Care2 use my personal information?
        </b>
        </p><p> 
        </p><ol>
          <li><b>Personal and Demographic Information:</b> Care2 asks for personal 
            information, such as your name, email address, and zip code. Your 
            personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to allow 
            you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply additional information for special site services like Meet Members, Biorhythms, and Stock Portfolios. This information is only used for the specific site feature chosen by the user. 
Care2 also asks for demographic  information, such as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly collect 
information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a 
child under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's 
information from the data base.
<p>
When you register to become a <b><a href="https://commerce1.care2.com/charter.html">Care2 Charter Member</a>,</b> we require personal information (like name, mailing address, credit card number). We use this information to ship products to you and confirm the validity of your credit card. We do not sell this information to any third-party. We do provide your mailing address to a third-party provider of Care2 apparel (T-shirts, Sweatshirts, etc.) so that these items can be mailed to you. We do not provide your credit card number to any outside parties.

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
</p><p>
We will not store your credit card information on our servers. Soon after processing your Charter Member transaction, we delete your credit card number from our servers. We retain your address information to ensure that users receive merchandise provided for various charter membership levels and in case we opt to send you additional gifts in the future. If we choose to user your mailing address information for promotional purposes, we would get explicit permission from users first. Without explicit permission, we will not use any addresses gathered through our store except for order processing.
            </p><p> 
          </p></li><li><b>Advertising:</b> Care2's goal in collecting personal and demographic 
            information is to provide our members with the most personalized web 
            experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to 
            reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver 
            more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and hence 
            better service, to you. 
            <p> In delivering targeted advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman. 
              Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they 
              want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad server 
              partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those criteria. 
              In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser – can access individuals' 
              account information. 
            
           </p><p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads 
              when you visit our web site. These companies may use information 
              (not including your name, address, email or telephone number) about 
              your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements 
              on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest 
              to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our 
              third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" 
              on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice 
              and to know your choices about not having this information use by 
              these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click 
              here</a>.
            
            </p><p> Advertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide 
              revenues for donations for Wildlife Conservation.

</p></li><li><b><a href="http://www.care2.com/community/cafe/">Care2 Café Discussions:</a></b> To post messages to the Care2 Café discussion boards, users must be Care2 members and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 username will appear hyperlinked as the "author" of each message. The username is required to ensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The username is hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed to allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail address. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box that is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when another user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive these e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before posting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile will appear (if you have submitted a member profile).

Care2 needs the user's e-mail address to contact users with questions about or acceptance of submissions and to provide the date when the submission will be featured on Care2. When featuring a user's Care2 Share submission, Care2 mentions the user's first name and will link to the user's member profile if he/she has submitted a profile. A member profile can only be viewed by Care2 members and can be hidden from view at anytime if a Care2 member adjusts his/her account profile found in the <a href="http://www.care2.com/accounts/manageaccount.html">My Care2 Page</a> or on the <a href="http://www.care2.com/members/add.html">Submit Profile page</a>.

            address and the name and email address of the intended e-card recipient. 
            Care2 will not use the recipient's email address for any reason other 
            than sending the greeting card notification intended by the sender. Care2's <a href="http://www.care2.com/members/tellafriend.html">Tell A Friend</a> feature ensures the same privacy for recipients.

            of the event, an event description, a name of the event host, and 
            a contact email address. Care2 requires this information to notify 
            the Care2 member that his/her event has been posted to the site. Care2 
            also requires this information to determine whether a submitted event 
            is environmentally relevant. If the event is not environmentally relevant, 
            Care2 can email the individual who submitted the event asking for 
            clarification. Additionally, by requiring a contact email address, 
            other Care2 users can ontact this individual with questions concerning 
            the event.

</p></li><li><b><a href="http://rainforest.care2.com/">Race for the Rain Forest</a></b> and <b><a href="http://bigcats.care2.com/">Race for the Big Cats</a></b>: Members and visitors may participate in the Races without entering personal information. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other Race participants, users must join the Race. Care2 members are automatically enrolled in the Races and hence their Race user name and password is the same as their Care2 user name and password. New visitors become Race participants by creating logins and passwords and an e-mail address, which is used to send Race participants optional Race updates and customer service communications. 

<p>

When Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site visits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using a template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is entered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or sell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants will also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be disabled using the "account settings" page on the Race web site. Through the unique url, members' friends' Race site visits are tracked and credited to the member using the unique url. Sending the url in personal e-mail or posting it in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2 specifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not know. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation statistics of the top 100 Racers are posted hourly, listed by the member's chosen Care2 login. The posted information for the top 100 Racers includes the number of visits to the Race for the Rain Forest and Big Cats sites and the number of acres the individual has helped protect.

To access their stock portfolio, users must login by using their Care2 username and password. Care2 does not share user login information with its financial content provider -- Stockpoint. Instead, when Care2 member's input their user name and password, Care2 generates a unique identifier that allows Stockpoint to display a Care2 member's stock portfolio when requested by the member without knowing any personal information about the member. The user can choose to supply the site with additional information to use some of the Stock Portfolio's additional features. This information will only be used for Stock Portfolios.

To complete the form, a member must submit his/her own name and e-mail address along with a friend's e-mail address. The member selects the information that will be sent based upon Care2's pre-provided categories; the member may also include a personal message to be included with Care2's pre-provided information. The recipient's (friend's) e-mail address is necessary to send the combined Care2 and member message. The sender's (member's) name and e-mail information is necessary for Care2 to reveal the sender's identity to the intended recipient. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or sell the e-mail addresses entered by members using the Tell A Friend form.

        </p><p> No, unless you request them. Currently, Care2 offers several direct 
          mailing describing our site progress, new features and announcements. If you do 
          not want to receive these occasional mailings, simply opt out of them 
          when registering to become a member. If you elect to receive the newsletter 
          but later change your mind, go to the My Care2 page and change your 
          preferences by unsubscribing to the newsletter.  Care2 also offers several opt-in
	  mailings including one from each of our partner nonprofit organizations and several
	  newsletters  from a commercial entity.  If you elect to receive any of these opt-in
	  newsletters, some personal information including your name and email address will
	  be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entitty delivering the newsletter.
	  The user should beware that by opting-in to either the nonprofit or commercial
	  newsletter offerings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and control the user
	  information sent out.

        <p>Yes, <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm">cookies</a> are 
          used on Care2 in two ways.
        </p><p> (1) We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your

          more personalized service to you.

        <p>Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?</p>
        </b> 
        <p>Not without your direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/spam.htm">SPAM</a>.
        </p><p> As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt-in to nonprofit partner newsletters, e-centives,
	or commercial newsletters.  In these cases and at your request, we will send your email
	address to a third party.  Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid
	to Care2 in exchange for a new customer.  </p>
	With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message 
          sent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages that 
          might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do 
          not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other companies.

        <b><a name="cards"></a> 
        </b><p><b>Why does my IP address show on the cards I send?
        </b> 
        </p><p> The reason we include your IP address* is because Care2 is not intended 
          as an anonymous e-mail / card service. Such systems are open to abuse, 
          and including the IP is one step we take to discourage such inappropriate 
          behavior. Additionally, all sends and pickups, including IP numbers, 
          dates and times are recorded and stored. It's unfortunate this is needed, 
          but the bottom line is that we require our customers to respect the 
          privacy and rights of other members of the web community and we act 
          to uphold this standard. 
        </p><p> There really is not much of a privacy concern by displaying the IP 
          on your card. First, your IP is included with every e-mail you've ever 
          sent. Second, most people's IP addresses are dynamic - meaning they 
          change each time you click on something, so anyone tracking down an 
          IP number would need to know the exact time the IP address was captured. 
          Third, it would cost so much, and would require so much legal work to 
          get the Internet Service Providers to release the customer name, that 
          it is basically worthless to anyone but law enforcement officials. 
        </p><p> If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel free to contact 
          us at support@earth.care2.com.
        </p><p> * Your "IP Address" is the numeric address of the server (Internet 
          computer) to which you connected to access the Internet. For a more
