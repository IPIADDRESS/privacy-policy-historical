<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Proper handling of your information with due regard to your
personal rights as well as observance of your right to
informational self-determination when using your personal data is a
major concern to us. Collection, processing and use of your
personal data conform to relevant legal provisions, particularly to
Australian data protection directives and their implementation in
national laws. Work In Progress reserves the right to adapt this
privacy policy to amended statutory provisions and regulations at
any time. Please keep up with changes to our privacy policy by
accessing it on our website using the appropriate link.</p>

<p>(1) Automatic collection, processing and use of personal
data</p>

<p>(1.1) Web service log files</p>

<p>When you access the web pages of our website with your browser,
our online shop server automatically stores the information
required for the operation of a web service in log files, including
the name of your browser, the name of your internet service
provider, the IP address of your PC, the address of the web page
from which you accessed our online shop, the name of your operating
system, the web pages you visit on our website, as well as the date
and duration of your visit. This information is temporarily stored
in the log files and automatically deleted afterward. The purpose
of this storage is, in case of a problem, to enable an analysis of
activities which possibly caused the fault.</p>

<p>(1.2) Cookies</p>

<p>Our online shop uses session cookies, which are small files
transferred to your PC by the web server. These files are used to
track your movement from page to page in our online shop or to
manage a shopping cart.</p>

<p>One the one hand, cookies are differentiated according to the
duration of their storage. So-called session cookies are
automatically deleted when you close your browser. A session cookie
can be used to manage a shopping cart or to identify products of
special interest, whereas permanent cookies remain stored on your
PC. Information about the storage duration is provided by your
browser. A permanent cookie can be reread the next time you visit
our website. To prevent this, you can delete the permanent cookie
after your visit to our website. Permanent cookies can for example
be used to provide information from a shop website for use by an
online payment service.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cookies are differentiated according to their
origin. So-called first-party cookies always originate from the
website indicated in your browser's address bar. So-called
third-party cookies originate from websites which you have not
visited directly, but have been tied into in the first-party's
website by means of images or advertisements. Your browser can tell
you the sources of the cookies stored on your PC.</p>

<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies. To disable this
function, please change the corresponding settings of your browser.
If your browser does not accept any cookies, you might not be able
to visit all the web pages of our online shop without any trouble.
To place an order, it is necessary for you to set your browser to
accept session cookies. Session cookies are automatically deleted
when you close your browser.</p>

<p>The web analysis tool that we use, Google Analytics, stores a
permanent cookie on your PC, when this function is enabled by the
browser settings. A permanent cookie can be reread the next time
you visit our website. To prevent this, you can delete the
permanent cookie after your visit to our website.</p>

<p>(1.3) Web Analysis Tool Google Analytics</p>

<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service
provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").&nbsp; Google Analytics uses
"cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help
the website analyze how users use the site. The information
generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on
servers in the United States. To protect your privacy, this website
will render your IP Address anonymous before it is transferred to
Google. Only in exceptional cases will your IP address be
transmitted in full length and rendered anonymous by Google in the
US. The operator of this website has commissioned Google to use
this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the
website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other
services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google
will not associate your IP address collected by Google Analytics
with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of
cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use
the full functionality of our online shop. The deletion of
permanent cookies after a visit to our online shop will not result
in any impairment.</p>

<p>Regardless of the way your browser handles cookies, you can opt
out of any collection, transfer, and processing of Google Analytics
related data (including your IP address) by downloading and
installing a Browser Plug-In, which can be downloaded using this
link <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>

<p>(1.4) Google E-commerce Tracking</p>

<p>We use Google e-commerce tracking in our online shop. Based on
Google Analytics, Google collects, on our behalf, information about
products added by customers to a shopping cart and provides this
information to us in anonymized reports, i.e. without a personal
reference option. You can prevent this tracking by installing the
Google Analytics deactivation plug-in in your browser as described
in (1.3).</p>

<p>(1.5) Market research and optimization of our website</p>

<p>To optimize our website and our advertising, we store individual
usage data under pseudonyms. This will not result in our contacting
you personally with advertisements. In addition, it is prohibited
by law to combine these usage data with information on the bearer
of the respective pseudonym. However, if you do not want us to
collect and analyze your usage data in this manner, you can opt
this out by sending a simple e-mail to
online@carhartt-wip.com.au.</p>

<p>(1.6) Affiliate Partner Programs</p>

<p>We cooperate with several partners that promote our products on
the internet. If you were redirected by one of the advertisements
run by our partners to our online shop, a corresponding cookie is
set. If you make a purchase in our shop afterward, the partner will
receive a commission for this. Your personal data is not disclosed
to the partner at any time during this process. We process these
data pseudonymously; we do not combine these data with information
on the bearer of the respective pseudonym under any circumstances.
You can prevent this processing by changing the cookies settings in
your browser accordingly.</p>

<p>(1.7) Pin it! Button</p>

<p>If you access a web page on our website which contains the Pin
it! Button, a connection to the Pinterest server is set up via a
plug-in. If you are logged in as a member of Pinterest at this
time, the information that you have accessed our website is
transmitted to your Pinterest account. Your interaction with
Pinterest, e.g. linking one of our shop offers on your pin board,
is directly controlled by the Pinterest server. The responsible
office with regard to data privacy regulations for the processing
of your data during the use of the Pin-It! Button is the partner
company Pinterest Inc., 635 High Street, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, USA.
To find out more about Pinterest privacy policies, go to <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/privacy/">http://pinterest.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not a member of Pinterest, or if you logged out of
your Pinterest before you visited our website, only your IP address
is transmitted to the Pinterest server to enable the graphic
representation of the button stored on the Pinterest server to be
displayed in your browser.</p>

<p>(1.8) Remarketing</p>

<p>We use retargeting technologies to selectively advertise
products on our partners' websites in which you were interested in
our shop.<br>
 During retargeting advertising material is adapted and displayed
based on a cookie-based and anonymized analysis of the previous
user behavior. No personal data are stored.<br>
 You can opt out the use of data generated by the cookie and
relating to your use of our website by adjusting your browser
settings to refuse third-party cookies.</p>

<p>(2) Collection and use of your information</p>

<p>(2.1) Information for processing your order</p>

<p>To enable optimum processing of your order, we collect and store
information required for business purposes and communicate it, if
required, to the companies (payment, logistics, shipping) involved
in the completion of your order.</p>

<p>The payment process is handled by an external service provider.
For this purpose you will temporarily be redirected to the service
provider's website when you place your order (check out). Basically
Work in Progress does not collect or store your credit card
information your Paypal or Postfinance account information. Payment
information may temporarily be stored as an exception only for
returns or complaints and only if you provide this information to
us.</p>

<p>We will use your e-mail address to send you status information
about your order. As an unregistered shopper, you will be asked to
state your e-mail address with every order. It will not be used for
any other purpose unless you expressly consent to this.</p>

<p>(3) Further privacy policies</p>
