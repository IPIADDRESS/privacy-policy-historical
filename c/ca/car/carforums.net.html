<b><h2>CarForums.net Privacy Policy</h2></b>
In a nutshell, we won't spam you or giveaway your personal information to anyone without your consent. But you may want to read the fine details but the bottom line is that we're committed to protecting your privacy because we know that without that, there can't be any trust between us within this community. 

<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
CarForums.net is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. CarForums.net  collects information from our users at several different points on our website including: 

<p><b>Registration</b></p>
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user when necessary or when they opt-in to an e-mail list or service provided by a CarForums.net partner. Certain types of demographic information such as zip codes may be collected in some cases but are optional but recommended to help us better personalize CarForums.net for you. 

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address.

<p><b>Security</b></p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

<p><b>Site and Service Updates</b></p>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email. 

<p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b></p>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the myProfile page or by emailing our Customer Service.
