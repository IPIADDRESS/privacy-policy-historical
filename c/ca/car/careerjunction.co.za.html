The information will be stored for verification purposes only and will be treated as confidential. If a CareerSeeker gives us permission we may publish details of their placement.</p>
<h4>6. Cookies<a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a></h4>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie terminates.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service Effective Measure that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate for usage and volume statistics to report on site traffic statistics. The Effective Measure Measurement Technology is used only for the collection of anonymous web site traffic statistics.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site and Effective Measure only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h4>7. Log Files<a name="log" id="log"></a></h4>
<p>We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>8. Sharing<a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a></h4>
<p>We sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We also partner with third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. We will not voluntarily disclose any information about individual users to third parties, except as described in this privacy statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of CareerJunction and its partner sites.</p>
<p>CareerJunction maintains relationships with outside service providers for some of the services offered through our site, for example MyGate and Virtual Card Services (VCS).</p>
<p>The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format, where the CareerJunction border will surround the pages served by the service provider, or where pages have the look and feel of CareerJunction. In either case, the service provider is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on those framed pages is provided directly to those service providers and is subject to their security and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside service providers because their privacy practices may differ from ours.</p>

<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify their username and password. Users also have the choice to subscribe to our newsletter. A user can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time from both our site and the newsletter itself.</p>
<p>CareerJunction may use your information to contact you about promotions and services.

<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information online. When asked to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), the information is encrypted and is protected via secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption technology. </p>
<p>We also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. Access to all of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our Client Service Manager) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure, access controlled environment. If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as their email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal details provided to us. This can be done from the user's My Portfolio page or by emailing our Client Service Manager at <a href="mailto:info@careerjunction.co.za?subject=Privacy" target="_blank">info@careerjunction.co.za</a>. </p>
