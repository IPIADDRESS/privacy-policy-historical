confidential. If a CareerSeeker gives us permission we may publish details of their
placement.</p>
<h4>6.&nbsp;Cookies<a name="cookies"></a> </h4>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about
the user. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a
password more than once. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie terminates.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service Effective Measure that uses cookies to track non-personally
identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate for usage and volume statistics
to report on site traffic statistics. The Effective Measure Measurement Technology is used only
for the collection of anonymous web site traffic statistics.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access
to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site and Effective Measure only
and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>8.&nbsp;Behavioral Targeting/Re-targeting<a name="behavioral"></a></h4>
<p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or
to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons
to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other
Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not
have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by
clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com" target="_blank_">Here</a>. Please note
this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<h4>9.&nbsp;Sharing<a name="sharing"></a></h4>
<p>We sometimes share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
This is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We also partner with third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up
for these services, we will share names or other information that is necessary for the third
party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable
information except for the purpose of providing these services. We will not voluntarily
disclose any information about individual users to third parties, except as described in
this privacy statement, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to
protect the rights or property of CareerJunction and its partner sites.</p>
<p>CareerJunction maintains relationships with outside service providers for some of the
services offered through our site, for example MyGate and Virtual Card Services (VCS).</p>
<p>The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format,
where the CareerJunction border will surround the pages served by the service provider, or
where pages have the look and feel of CareerJunction. In either case, the service provider is
prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on those framed
pages is provided directly to those service providers and is subject to their security
and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside service
providers because their privacy practices may differ from ours.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personally identifiable information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process </li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect
your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>
<li>if CareerJunction is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its
assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any
change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any
choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information, </li>
<li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>

<h4>11. Communications<a name="communications"></a></h4>
<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify their username and password. Users also have
the choice to subscribe to our newsletter. A user can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time
from both our site and the newsletter itself.</p>
<p>CareerJunction may use your information to contact you about promotions and services. You are
entitled, at any stage, to opt out of this service, by clicking on the "opt out" option on the
email correspondence. This will redirect you to the My Portfolio page where you will be able to
unsubscribe from newsletters, promotional communications and/ or service announcements.</p>
<p>From time to time we may send out critical service announcements. Users are not able to unsubscribe
from critical service announcements, which contain important information about the service.</p>
<h4>12.&nbsp;Security and Data Storage<a name="security"></a></h4>
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information online. When asked to enter
sensitive information (such as a credit card number), the information is encrypted and is protected
via secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption technology.</p>
<p>We also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. Access to all of our
users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform
a specific job (for example, our Client Service Manager) are granted access to personally identifiable
information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure,
access controlled environment. If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as their
email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide a way to correct, update
or remove that user's personal details provided to us. This can be done from the user's My Portfolio
page or by emailing our Client Service Manager at <a href="mailto:info@careerjunction.co.za">info@careerjunction.co.za</a>.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h4>13.&nbsp;Choice/Opt Out<a name="choice"></a></h4>

this facility by going to their My Portfolio page, to My Resume and select to be non-searchable.

My Portfolio page, to My Newsletter and select to not receive newsletters.</p>

responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
