		<p><strong>Thank you for reviewing our Privacy Policy. Your online safety is of utmost importance to us.</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p>This is Card Player Media, LLC's Privacy Policy, which is effective as of March 7, 2008, and describes how Card Player collects and uses information from the Card Player Card Player website and subscriber information. Card Player respects the privacy rights of our users and recognizes the importance of protecting the information collected about you. Card Player uses your data to administer your subscription, provide information of interest to you, and to communicate with you. Card Player stores your data in the United States, and our use of your data is subject to this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail. If you have any questions regarding the Privacy Policy, or wish to contact us, please send an email to  <a href="mailto:support@cardplayer.com?subject=Privacy Policy"> support@cardplayer.com</a>.</p>
		<h3>Types of Information Collected</h3>
		<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
		  Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you on-line or off-line. Card Player collects personal information from our online visitors during account registration, or through sign-ups for newsletter and magazine subscriptions, referral services, and other marketing surveys and email campaigns.<br>
		<br>
		Information collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address, birth date, and credit card information. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as gender, zip code, software, platform, Internet IP address and connection, information about your use of the website such as click paths and other data that you may provide in surveys or online profiles. We may combine demographic information with personal information, such as email address, to tailor our offerings or web pages to your preferences or interests.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>
		We may store non-personally identifiable information that we collect through log files to create a profile of our users in the aggregate. Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks which we will use to analyze trends, administer the Service or Card Player website, track aggregate service and usage patterns, and gather broad demographic information for general use. Your individual usage cannot be tracked through aggregate data. </p>
		<br>
		<p>As is standard practice on many web sites, Card Player may use "cookies" and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our web site is the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Online Chat Rooms and Profiles</strong><br>
		You may choose to disclose information, including personal information, about yourself through chat functions, message boards, screen name profiles for public view, or in similar forums on the website. Information that you disclose through these features is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of those features, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit through these features.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Children</strong><br>
		When creating an account, we require the new member to certify that he or she is 18 years old or over by checking the appropriate box. If a child under age 18 attempts to register with CardPlayer.com, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian create a CardPlayer.com Family Account to obtain parental permission. <br>

		<br>
		<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
		The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number numbers) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact support@cardplayer.com. </p>
		<br>
