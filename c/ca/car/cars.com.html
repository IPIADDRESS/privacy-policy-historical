<p>
<b>Registration, Service Requests and Web Forms:</b> You may be asked to provide personal information to use certain services on this Web site, which will be apparent from the forms we ask you to complete.

<b>How do we use the information we collect?</b>
<blockquote>
<b>Site Interaction:</b> The information you provide when you register with <b>cars.com</b> or fill out other forms on our site may be stored on our servers or, in some cases, in a cookie on your computer. This information will be used to compile aggregate data that is not personally identifiable and may be used internally or shared with third parties. This information also may be used to confirm and fulfill a request you are making, to follow up on that request and to communicate with you about the <b>cars.com</b> service.  The messages that <b>cars.com</b> sends for these purposes may incidentally include promotional material or other content from <b>cars.com</b> or its partners.  In the case of these messages, we are not sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties, nor will we continue to send you promotional messages if you ask us not to, as described below in the section titled “<a href="#access">Accessing, Changing or Deactivating Information Collected by <b>cars.com</b></a>.”
<p>
<b>Direct Promotion:</b> Using the contact information provided by registrants 18 years of age or older, including e-mail addresses, <b>cars.com</b>, its affiliates or third parties to whom <b>cars.com</b> discloses such information in accordance with this privacy policy (including its partners or advertisers) may periodically send you promotional or informational messages. In any case where we might use your contact information for this purpose, you will be able to indicate at registration whether you wish to receive such promotional or informational messages.  However, by providing us your personal contact information when you register or request specific services, you agree that <b>cars.com</b> may contact you regarding account status, changes to this privacy policy or other terms of service, and to confirm, fulfill and follow up on your registration, service or information request.

<b>Visitor Behavior:</b>  <b>Cars.com</b> may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our Web site, for development purposes, and to inform advertisers and partners about consumers who click on their advertising or other messages. In these analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form, except as specified below. We also may use personally identifiable information to improve your experience while you are visiting our Web site. This might include prefilling your personal information into Web forms so that you do not have to retype it or presenting you with editorial and advertising content that may be of interest.

<a name="whom"></a> 
<b>With whom do we share the information we collect?</b>
<blockquote>
<b>Cars.com</b> will share personally identifiable information with third parties in the following cases:
<ol>
<li> With affiliated newspapers and other affiliates for whom we provide Web sites. Certain affiliates have Web pages that are branded with both their trademarks and ours. You may visit us through a co-branded page of such a site, for example, a <b>cars.com</b> page that is co-branded with XYZ Newspaper’s Web site. If you entered the <b>cars.com</b> Web site through a site maintained by one of these affiliates, then your personally identifiable information may be shared with that affiliate on the condition that the affiliate’s use of the information is consistent with this privacy policy.<p>
</p></li><li> As is necessary for third parties to provide information or perform services specifically requested by you.  For example, if you request a vehicle price quote from a dealership through our service, we will share the information you entered with that dealership. Similarly, if through <b>cars.com</b> you request additional information from a car manufacturer or financial institution, we will share your information with those companies. Personally identifiable information also may be included in reports to these third parties, but only when you have already submitted the information to the third party as described above. After the information is provided to such third parties, <b>cars.com</b> does not and cannot control their subsequent use or disclosure of information.<p>
</p></li><li> For direct marketing purposes, but only if you have authorized <b>cars.com</b> to do so and only if you are 18 years of age or older.  Although <b>cars.com</b> will notify all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, <b>cars.com</b> does not and cannot control their subsequent use or disclosure of information.<p>
</p></li><li> To perform analytical and other services as an agent of <b>cars.com</b>. In some cases, we may work with third parties that do analysis and development on our behalf. We may share your personally identifiable information with such a third party on the condition that the third party maintains the information as confidential and uses the information only to perform the services specified by <b>cars.com</b>.
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Message Boards </b></p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<b>Cars.com</b> offers message boards, or forums, on some of its Web sites for use by visitors who are 18 years of age or older. Any information you disclose when posting a message in these forums becomes public. Moreover, registrants who post a message in our forums make their e-mail addresses available to others through a feature of our software, which could result in unsolicited e-mail from third parties.
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>E-mail a Friend </b>
</p><blockquote>
<b>Cars.com</b> sometimes offers you the ability to send an e-mail to a friend or other third party. E-mail a Friend functionality is for informational purposes only and may not be used for any unlawful purpose. This includes all harassment or threats. <b>Cars.com</b> expressly reserves the right to release information you provide through use of this functionality (including but not limited to e-mail addresses, names and IP addresses) to third parties in any case of suspected abuse or other problems, in order to enforce our terms of service and to protect or troubleshoot the service, the site, its users or others who may be affected. Information collected under the “E-mail a Friend” functionality is otherwise subject to the same limitations of use, access, security and disclosure described elsewhere in this privacy policy.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>How do we handle changes to your information or to this policy? </b>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<b>Notification of Changes:</b> Any changes to this policy will be posted on our Web site in this location. If those changes affect how we use your personally identifiable information, we will contact you at the e-mail address in our records to notify you of the change before it takes effect in regard to your information. You can then either agree to the changes, modify your personally identifiable information or deactivate your user record. 
<p>
<a name="access"></a>
<b>Accessing, Changing or Deactivating Information Collected by cars.com:</b> If you wish to access, verify the accuracy of, change or deactivate your personal information on file with <b>cars.com</b>; change your permissions regarding use of personally identifiable information for direct promotion purposes by <b>cars.com</b> or its partners (including affiliates and third parties identified in this policy); or deactivate your <b>cars.com</b> membership, you can use the interface available at <a href="javascript:targetWindow('http://siy.cars.com/members/nameduser_entry.jhtml');" target="_top">http://siy.cars.com/members/nameduser_entry.jhtml</a>. 
</p><p>
<b>Deactivation of User Information:</b> If you deactivate your user information, your account information will no longer be used by <b>cars.com</b> or made available to third parties except in an aggregate form or as required by law.

<p>
<b>Security </b>
</p><blockquote>
Your personal information is one of our most valuable assets. It is kept physically secure in our data centers and is accessible only to authorized personnel as needed to perform operations governed by this policy.

</blockquote> 
<p>
<b>Childrens Guidelines </b>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
We believe that it is especially important to protect children’s privacy online. We encourage parents to get involved with their children’s online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Note: We define “children” as minors younger than 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information from children, and we do not provide any personally identifiable information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our visitors younger than 13 years old. We do not knowingly allow children to register with us or to participate in any of our promotions or contests. No information should be submitted to or posted at <b>cars.com</b> by visitors younger than 13 years old.  In the event that <b>cars.com</b> obtains information from an individual who indicates that he/she is younger than 13 years old, <b>cars.com</b> will promptly discard the personally identifiable information without collecting, using or disclosing such information to any third party.  You should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address or other information on any Web site, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages.

<p>
<b>Does this privacy statement extend to links to other sites? </b>
</p><p>

While we encourage our business partners to adopt privacy policies that build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of Web sites linked to any of our sites.
