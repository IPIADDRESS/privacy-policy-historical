					Cartoon Network is fully committed to providing a fun, entertaining,
					and safe web site for people of all ages. CartoonNetwork.com supports
					and intends to comply with the privacy guidelines developed by
					the Online Privacy Alliance and the Children's Advertising Review
					Unit’s (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The CARU
					guidelines and our policy aim at "respecting and fostering the
					parents' role in providing guidance for their children." Because
					we want our audience to feel comfortable exploring the content
					offered on CartoonNetwork.com, this Online Safety &amp; Privacy Policy
					outlines and clarifies how we collect and use information online,
					our advertising policies, and the safeguards we recommend to ensure
					a fun and safe web experience. As new technology and online standards
					evolve, we may modify these policies to better address your concerns.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Data Collection</b><br>
					CartoonNetwork.com does not sell or distribute any information
					obtained from our visitors to a third party, under any circumstance.
					We give parents (of children under the age of 13) notice via email
					when we collect information (email addresses or any other) from
					their child. For visitors over 13 years of age, we may collect
					information, with the user’s permission, that will be used to
					improve your experience on CartoonNetwork.com (example: online
					survey).<br>
					<br>
					Currently, there are three ways that CartoonNetwork.com collects
					information online:<br>
					1. Sweepstakes and contests<br>
					2. Voluntary submissions via email<br>
					3. Cookie technology<br>
					<br>
					<b>Sweepstakes and Contests</b><br>
					CartoonNetwork.com strives to create imaginative online contests
					or promotions. We do this because, well, it’s fun. However, before
					entering a Cartoon Network contest online, we require kids to
					ask a parent for permission. To enter online, we will ask for
					an email address or AOL screen name. Children under 13 years of
					age are required to enter their parent’s email address as well.
					This is done so that we may contact a parent via email to notify
					them that their child has entered a Cartoon Network contest and
					give them the option to remove the child’s email address from
					the list of other entries. Sometimes we may also require a visitor
					to provide us additional information that is not personally identifiable.
					For example, we might ask you to tell us your favorite character
					or answer a trivia question. <br>
					<br>
					The email address is only used to contact you if you have won.
					It is not collected or stored in any database to contact you at
					a future time. Once a winner has been selected, that person will
					be contacted via the winner’s email address given at time of entry.
					If the email address has changed or been deleted or is no longer
					operational, the entry will become void. Cartoon Network will
					not be held responsible for invalid email addresses. The winner
					will receive a notification letter via email that must be filled
					out and signed by a parent and returned through the U.S. Postal
					mail or specified fax number. Once the letter has been received,
					the prize will be awarded. In the event the letter is not returned
					by the specified deadline, the prize may be awarded to another
					entrant.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Voluntary Submissions via Email</b><br>
					Cartoon Network enjoys interacting with its audience. Therefore,
					there will be opportunities for visitors to contact us online.
					These currently include Mail Bag, Your 2 Cents, and the Feedback
					Button. In these areas, an email address will be collected, and
					in some cases, you may receive a response. <br>
					<br>
					In addition, sometimes you will have the choice to select the
					option to subscribe to a free online newsletter sent to the email
					address you provide. The newsletter will have fun, informative
					updates about CartoonNetwork.com. When a child under 13 years
					of age requests this newsletter, we collect their email address
					as well as their parent’s email address. A notification will be
					sent to the parent informing them that the child requested a free
					newsletter that will be sent to the child’s email account. The
					parent can request at any time, through the options described
					in the notification, how to un-subscribe their child from this
					newsletter. In addition, each time the newsletter is emailed,
					directions will clearly be stated how to remove oneself from the
					email newsletter.<br>
					<br>
					Under no circumstances, will your email address be provided to
					any third parties. Again, we require children to get parental
					permission before using these areas. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Cookies: the non-edible kind</b><br>
					Cookies are little, tiny pieces of information that your browser
					stores on your computer, like what browser you're using or what
					operating system you use. At CartoonNetwork.com, we use cookies
					to help make your experience better and understand how well we're
					doing. We only use cookies so we know how many visitors we have
					and how often they visit: that's the best way to know if you like
					what we're doing. Under no circumstances do we use cookies to
					collect or cross-relate personal information about you. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Secure Server</b><br>
					CartoonNetwork.com has a secure server which transmits the data,
					scrambles it and decodes it on our end. This is the best form
					of web technology available to protect that your information is
					not captured by an outside user. <br>
					<br>
					When you enter your email address or AOL® screen name for online
					contests on CartoonNetwork.com, this information is collected
					through a secure server. This information gets translated or encrypted
					with a complicated code by your browser, sent to our server, translated
					back into what you sent, and passed on to us. That way, no one
					can tell anything about you by listening in on our conversation:
					it's all encrypted and super secret.<br>
					<br>
					You'll know it's working when you see the little key icon at the
					bottom of the browser's screen turn a solid blue. The solid key
					means your connection to our server is encrypted and secure.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms on America Online®</b><br>
					On our site on America Online®, Cartoon Network offers visitors
					the opportunity to participate in our online community activities.
					These currently include our bulletin boards and chat rooms. All
					Cartoon Network community areas on AOL® are monitored to maintain
					a safe and fun environment. In addition, parents can control access
					a child has on AOL by going to keyword "parental controls," where
					they can select the areas in which their child may participate.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Advertising on CartoonNetwork.com</b><br>
					It is very important to Cartoon Network that we help our audience,
					especially children, to be able to distinguish advertisements
					and promotional material. We have made efforts to create easy-to-understand
					notices that are clearly displayed on all advertising and promotional
					material on our site. In addition, all advertising banners will
					have the word "ad" or "advertisement" as part of its space.<br>
					<br>
					While visiting CartoonNetwork.com, advertisement banners will
					appear at the top of most of the pages on the screen. Many of
					these advertisement banners come from companies who want to tell
					the visitor about their goods and services. Other banners will
					be messages from CartoonNetwork.com telling the visitor about
					some features on our site or about our television network. By
					clicking on one of these banners, it will automatically go to
					a page which gives more information related to the banner. CartoonNetwork.com
					carefully screens all sponsor’s sites before linking to them.
					Of course, web sites and addresses change regularly, and we cannot
					guarantee the content of every place we link to.<br>
					<br>
					In addition, Cartoon Network.com will be providing you special
					programming created by us that has been supported by our sponsors.
					This type of advertising will be clearly identified as being "presented
					by" or "sponsored by" a particular sponsor. In some cases, there
					will be a link to the sponsor’s web site.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Safeguards</b><br>
					<b>Monitor Your Child’s Internet Usage</b><br>
					As we have taken special precautions to help aide in the safety
					of your child’s World Wide Web experience, we ask parents to closely
					monitor the Internet activities of their children and become educated
					on the various Internet and software tools available to help ensure
					that their child has a fun and satisfying on-line experience.
					You can visit your local computer store retailer for more information
					on these products.<br>
					<br>
					<b>America Online® Parental Controls</b><br>
					America Online® has established a technology on their online service
					which allows parents to control and restrict the areas their children
					can go to not only on AOL, but on the Internet as well. AOL subscribers
					can go to keyword "parental controls" to find out more information.<br>

					there will be opportunities for visitors to contact us online.
					These currently include Mail Bag, Your 2 Cents, and the Feedback
					Button. In these areas, an email address will be collected, and
					in some cases, you may receive a response. <br>
					<br>
					In addition, sometimes you will have the choice to select the
					option to subscribe to a free online newsletter sent to the email
					address you provide. The newsletter will have fun, informative
					updates about CartoonNetwork.com. When a child under 13 years
					of age requests this newsletter, we collect their email address
					as well as their parent’s email address. A notification will be
					sent to the parent informing them that the child requested a free
					newsletter that will be sent to the child’s email account. The
					parent can request at any time, through the options described
					in the notification, how to un-subscribe their child from this
					newsletter. In addition, each time the newsletter is emailed,
					directions will clearly be stated how to remove oneself from the
					email newsletter.<br>
					<br>
					Under no circumstances, will your email address be provided to
					any third parties. Again, we require children to get parental
					permission before using these areas. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Cookies: the non-edible kind</b><br>
					Cookies are little, tiny pieces of information that your browser
					stores on your computer, like what browser you're using or what
					operating system you use. At CartoonNetwork.com, we use cookies
					to help make your experience better and understand how well we're
					doing. We only use cookies so we know how many visitors we have
					and how often they visit: that's the best way to know if you like
					what we're doing. Under no circumstances do we use cookies to
					collect or cross-relate personal information about you. <br>
					<br>
					<b>Secure Server</b><br>
					CartoonNetwork.com has a secure server which transmits the data,
					scrambles it and decodes it on our end. This is the best form
					of web technology available to protect that your information is
					not captured by an outside user. <br>
					<br>
					When you enter your email address or AOL® screen name for online
					contests on CartoonNetwork.com, this information is collected
					through a secure server. This information gets translated or encrypted
					with a complicated code by your browser, sent to our server, translated
					back into what you sent, and passed on to us. That way, no one
					can tell anything about you by listening in on our conversation:
					it's all encrypted and super secret.<br>
					<br>
					You'll know it's working when you see the little key icon at the
					bottom of the browser's screen turn a solid blue. The solid key
					means your connection to our server is encrypted and secure.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms on America Online®</b><br>
					On our site on America Online®, Cartoon Network offers visitors
					the opportunity to participate in our online community activities.
					These currently include our bulletin boards and chat rooms. All
					Cartoon Network community areas on AOL® are monitored to maintain
					a safe and fun environment. In addition, parents can control access
					a child has on AOL by going to keyword "parental controls," where
					they can select the areas in which their child may participate.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Advertising on CartoonNetwork.com</b><br>
					It is very important to Cartoon Network that we help our audience,
					especially children, to be able to distinguish advertisements
					and promotional material. We have made efforts to create easy-to-understand
					notices that are clearly displayed on all advertising and promotional
					material on our site. In addition, all advertising banners will
					have the word "ad" or "advertisement" as part of its space.<br>
					<br>
					While visiting CartoonNetwork.com, advertisement banners will
					appear at the top of most of the pages on the screen. Many of
					these advertisement banners come from companies who want to tell
					the visitor about their goods and services. Other banners will
					be messages from CartoonNetwork.com telling the visitor about
					some features on our site or about our television network. By
					clicking on one of these banners, it will automatically go to
					a page which gives more information related to the banner. CartoonNetwork.com
					carefully screens all sponsor’s sites before linking to them.
					Of course, web sites and addresses change regularly, and we cannot
					guarantee the content of every place we link to.<br>
					<br>
					In addition, Cartoon Network.com will be providing you special
					programming created by us that has been supported by our sponsors.
					This type of advertising will be clearly identified as being "presented
					by" or "sponsored by" a particular sponsor. In some cases, there
					will be a link to the sponsor’s web site.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Safeguards</b><br>
					<b>Monitor Your Child’s Internet Usage</b><br>
					As we have taken special precautions to help aide in the safety
					of your child’s World Wide Web experience, we ask parents to closely
					monitor the Internet activities of their children and become educated
					on the various Internet and software tools available to help ensure
					that their child has a fun and satisfying on-line experience.
					You can visit your local computer store retailer for more information
					on these products.<br>
					<br>
					<b>America Online® Parental Controls</b><br>
					America Online® has established a technology on their online service
					which allows parents to control and restrict the areas their children
					can go to not only on AOL, but on the Internet as well. AOL subscribers
					can go to keyword "parental controls" to find out more information.<br>
