During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to create an account for the user for the service in which the user has expressed interest.

A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and home address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. You will be notified if you are agreeing to make a regular payment before you proceed with it – to terminate a regular payment or dispute a payment email <strong> <img src="/images/supportEmail.gif"></strong> or write to Payments Department, CardBoardFish, First Floor, Saxon House, John Roberts Business Park, Whitstable CT5 3BJ.

We reserve the right to use your information to monitor usage of products and services, and to contact you using it when we deem it necessary. Your information is kept private and secure and is not disclosed to third parties other than to perform actions on behalf of CardBoardFish. None of your information will be used for any secondary purposes or for anything not directly related to the reason why you supplied it. As CardBoardFish take such a high standing on the use of personal information, the user is expected to provide information which is accurate.</p>

                                <p>CardBoardFish uses cookies and some other devices during your usage of the sites. CardBoardFish does not create a profile of individual users and visitors and does not target users depending on their usage of the site to protect their privacy. Third party advertisers, however, may create a profile of a user to determine what adverts are served to CardBoardFish users and where.</p>

                                <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Your password is not stored in a cookie; instead the cookie stores the session ID. This is for your own security and privacy, and if users reject the cookie, the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, users may not be able to use registration systems such as CBFMail, or high security processes such as on CBFSMS or FRFL.</p>
                                
                                <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. The information stored by our advertisers is in no way linked to your personal information, which is kept completely private and secure at all times.</p>

                                <p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by several globally recognised companies, our Web advertising partners. Information about a users' visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site.

                                <p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. Log files are kept for your security, not to infringe your privacy.</p>

                                <p>In order to use our FREE services FRFL and CBFSMS, you must enter the mobile phone number of the recipient. This number is only stored by CardBoardFish for logging and security reasons and is in no way disclosed to any third party for no other purpose than to send the item you requested to the number you supplied. As stated in our registration for the Data Protection Act of 1998, all information collected is for accounts and records purposes.</p>

Established members will occasionally receive information deemed necessary by CardBoardFish for their use of the services. These messages do not infringe the users privacy and are part of the CardBoardFish service.

                                <p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. These messages are not promotional and are always essential to the users' use of CardBoardFish products and services. Receiving these messages is part of the CardBoardFish service.</p>

Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If, as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by these web sites (CardBoardFish).</p>

                                <p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or competitions. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice of whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information. Contact information will be used/shared with the competition/survey to notify the winners, and award prizes, or analyse data. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site, as well as by our advertisers. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice, or the survey or competition is entered through an advert provided by a third party advertising company. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
                                
                                <p></p><div class="boldItalicTitle">Tell-A-Friend</div><p></p>
                                
                                <p>When using some of our products and systems the user will be asked for a referrer. For example, on signing up for the CBFMail system, you can enter the account name of the person who referred you. This information is used by CardBoardFish for monitoring purposes and occasionally to reward those users who attract others to CardBoardFish for their support.</p>

                                <p>CardBoardFish takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
                                
                                <p>When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), the information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, invisible, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.</p>
                                
                                <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Daily, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, and are protected from intrusion by a state-of-the-art Intrusion Detection System (IDS).</p>

                                <p>In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary, sometimes, for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>

                                <p>CardBoardFish reserves the right to perform credit referencing and other checks before offering credit facilities to customers where available. Checks will be made by our authorised third party to authorise transactions on major credit and debit cards if you are making purchases through CardBoardFish. They will obtain "available credit" information from your card issuer and may validate other details for security reasons.</p>

We reserve the right to verify your personal information at any time, and if we find it to be incorrect we will contact you. If we cannot contact you, you are regarded as "Gone Away". This means you have not kept your information held by us accurately and correctly. Your account will be suspended and in extreme cases of none-contact removed entirely to protect the integrity of the information we hold. It is essential that your personal data is correct and up to date at all time.</p>

                                <p>CardBoardFish requires you to keep your information accurate and correct. If at any time you wish to see the information held about you by CardBoardFish, as specified by the Data Protection Act 1998, you need to contact us and request your account details. A charge deemed by CardBoardFish as “reasonable” will need to be paid before we release the information to cover our administration costs. If any information  held about you by CardBoardFish is inaccurate then you are responsible for ensuring it is corrected. You must also ensure the information given to us is accurate and correct at all times. We will amend any information found to be incorrect but any information provided directly by you (i.e. name and address) is your responsibility to maintain. CardBoardFish reserves the right to retain your personal information for as long as is necessary after you request your account closed. However, you will no longer be bound by the terms and conditions of a service once a CardBoardFish representative has confirmed the account closed. You must no longer use this account.</p>

                                <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

                                <p>If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
