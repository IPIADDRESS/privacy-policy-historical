<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><a id="whatwecollect" name="whatwecollect"></a>2.&nbsp; <span style="color: #333333;">What information do we collect?</span></span></h3>
<p>Company collects the personal information needed to provide Company Services and for our business operations.&nbsp; If you choose not to provide certain personal information to us, we may not be able to provide you with the services you require.&nbsp; The following are the main types of personal information collected by Company and the main purposes for which they are collected.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information you provide to Company in the course of registering for or acquiring a Company Service, for example, to create an account, submit an enquiry, become a subscriber, become an advertiser, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a competition.&nbsp; Registration Information may include, for example, name, delivery or postal address, email address, gender and birthday.&nbsp; It includes additional information which you provide to Company in the course of that relationship.&nbsp; Where possible you may have the option of interacting with us anonymously (for example when browsing our digital products as a casual user) or using a pseudonym.&nbsp; We will usually make it clear whenever this is an option.</p>
<p><strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> consist of comments or content that you post to the Company Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, tweets, status, profile information and picture(s).&nbsp; Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Information from third party Social Media.&nbsp; </strong>If you access or log-in to a Company Service through a third party<strong> </strong>social media service or connect a Company Service to a third party<strong> </strong>social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the third party<strong> </strong>social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address, followers or friends lists, and any information you have disclosed in connection with that social media service.&nbsp; We do not collect your passwords other than in relation to our own services.&nbsp; When you access the Company Services through third party<strong> </strong>social media services or when you connect a Company Service to third party<strong> </strong>social media services, you are authorizing Company to collect, store use and disclose such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Activity Information – cookies and other technologies.&nbsp; </strong>When you access and interact with the Company Services, we may collect certain information about those visits.&nbsp; For example, in order to permit your connection to the Company Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Company Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information from that device.</p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies and local storage, pixel beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data or code that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.&nbsp; Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so that such websites, apps and other services can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.&nbsp; These technologies may also be used to collect and store information such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have viewed in relation to your usage of the Company Services and other websites you have visited.<br>Third parties that support the Company Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Company Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Company does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties using such technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Information from Other Sources.&nbsp; </strong>We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as commercially available sources and data providers<strong>, </strong>as well as information from our business partners or related and affiliated companies in Australia or internationally.</p>
