<p><strong>Information we collect through your use of the Site.</strong></p>
<p> As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected.  Through technologies like cookies, pixels, beacons and log files, we may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services.  For example we may determine through your IP address that you are located in New York City and we may deliver advertisements promoting New York City based-businesses.  By knowing about you, we can deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements.  Please see the sections below: <a onclick="$('target_advertising').scrollTo();return false;" href="">To Target Advertising</a> and <a onclick="$('cookies_web_beacons').scrollTo();return false;" href="">Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Information</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Information we receive from third parties.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the information that you provide or we collect on the Site or through the Services, we may verify or collect certain information about you from third parties.  For example, we may use your email address to determine your street address or we may use your street address to obtain demographic information about you or the 9-digit ZIP code (ZIP+4) in which you live. This information may include household income, presence and age(s) of children, and other census data.   We may combine this third party information with the information we have already collected from you via our Sites and Services. We protect and use this third party information in the same way that we treat other information – in conformance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We will use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the time that the information is collected.</p>

<p></p><p id="target_advertising"><strong>To Target Advertising.</strong> </p>
<p> We believe that advertising on the Internet is more interesting to you when it is relevant.  Accordingly, we customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you knowingly provide us (e.g., age, gender, stated health interests and other information in your profile); (ii) geographic location which we determine through your IP address; (iii) data we receive from third parties or (iv) your behavior on this Site or other Sites.</p>
<p>To assist us with the last listed category, a practice known as “Online Behavioral Advertising”, we engage a third party vendors.  With the help of a cookie that our vendors places on your browser when you visit a page of the Site, we determine your interests and target advertisements and promotions based on those interests.  For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Site, we may determine that you are interested in that topic and through the use of a vendor’s cookie, we may later serve you an advertisement for a product intended to help sufferers of the particular health condition.  The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with our vendor.</p>
<p>We understand that some people prefer not to receive targeted advertising and there are a few ways that you can limit the customization of the advertising we deliver to you. You can opt-out of our Online Behavioral Advertising by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a> and opting-out of cookies placed by Collective and Microsoft Advertising, our current vendors.  You can limit the way that we target advertising based on your self-reported interests and some other information in your profile by clicking on the “profile” section of this Site and deleting or modifying the information. On some Sites, the profile section is accessed through the MySite tab, e.g., MyEverydayHealth or MyRevolution). Please see the section below on <a href="" onclick="$('control_personal_information').scrollTo();return false;"> Updating and Control of Your Personal Information</a> for more information . Please note that if you have registered on multiple Sites, you’ll need to modify your profile on each site.  In addition, you can delete the cookies that we or Collective or Microsoft Advertising have placed on your browser.  Please see the section below on <a onclick="$('cookies_web_beacons').scrollTo();return false;" href="">Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Information </a>for more information.</p>
<p><strong>To Provide the Sites and Services.</strong></p>
<p>In general, we use your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>when you register for the Site and set up an account, you may provide us certain information including your name, email address, screen name, password, demographic information and the health topics that interest you.  For more information see <a href="" onclick="$('ad_networks').scrollTo();return false;">Registration: Public and Private Settings below</a></li>
    <li>when you create a CarePage, you may provide information about the patient including the patient’s name, location, health facility and condition</li>
    <li>you may add to your profile by providing information about your interests or health topics. For more information see <a href="" onclick="$('ad_networks').scrollTo();return false;">Registration: Public and Private Settings</a> below</li>
    <li>if you sign up to receive updates from a CarePage or a newsletter, respond to a survey or poll, enter a contest or participate in social networking activities, you may provide us contact information (e.g., email or physical address)</li>
    <li>if you purchase a product or service, you may provide us your credit card information; and</li>
    <li>improve the quality of the Site and the Services, and</li>
    <li>analyze, benchmark and conduct research on, user data and user interactions with the Site and Services</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may stop you from gaining access to a Service or limit the features that you can use. For more information, please see the <a href="" onclick="$('how_we_use_info').scrollTo();return false;">How We Use Your Information section below.</a></p>
<p id="information_we_collect"><strong>B. Information we collect through your use of the Site.</strong></p>
<p>As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, beacons, log files and other technologies, we may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example we may determine through an IP address that a particular computer or device is located in New York City and we may use this information to deliver advertisements promoting New York City-based businesses. This information allows us to deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements. Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising sections below for more information. </p>

<p><strong>C. Information we receive from third parties.</strong></p>
<p>We may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties with the information we have already collected from you via our Sites and Services.  The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including to verify other information about you (e.g., verify your mailing address to send you requested products or services) and to enhance the content and advertising we provide to you.</p>

<h3 id="ad_networks"><strong>2. Your Profile: Public and Private Settings</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the information you provide when registering for the Site is automatically populated into your profile. In addition, by clicking on Edit My Profile, you can tell us more about yourself.  For example, you may be able to upload your photograph, provide a narrative autobiography, and identify keywords that describe you or your situation.  You will be able to select whether you want your profile to be public or private. Some parts of a public profile are made available to Site users through the Site search function or links on the Site (e.g., clicking on your display name as it appears in search results, a forum, or associated with a blog). When a Site user accesses a public profile, the user will be able to see your display name and location, and to the extent that you have provided the information, your photo and biography.  </p>
<p>Within the My Profile area, members have the option to indicate health interests. Posting your health interests within the Profile area allows us to customize your experience on the Site and to provide relevant articles, tips or advertising. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Managers</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A. Patient Consent Required.</strong></p>
<p>If you are creating a CarePages webpage (“CarePage”) on someone else’s behalf, you must first receive the consent of the patient and provide proof of the patient’s consent if we request it.</p>


<p id="control_personal_information"><strong>B. Levels of Access.</strong></p>
<p>When you create a CarePage, you will select the level of access. There are three levels of access: Community Access, Friends &amp; Family Access and Invitation Only.  Community Access will be the default setting.</p>

<p><strong>(1)	Invitation Only CarePage: </strong> A CarePage with Invitation Only access requires the website Manager to invite and approve all visitors before they can access that CarePage.  Access is at the discretion of the CarePage Manager and all new visitors must be approved by the Manager. The Invitation Only access CarePage is not available via the Site search function.</p>

<p><strong>(2)	Friends &amp; Family Access CarePage </strong> To join a Friends &amp; Family Access CarePage, all registered users must know the exact name of the CarePage and enter it into the Site search function.  Site users who are not signed into CarePages.com can find the CarePage listing by typing in the exact name of the CarePage in the Search function at the top of the page.  Search results will list the CarePage name, patient name and the facility where the patient is receiving care. Only signed-in members can actually access the CarePage and must have either received an invitation or know the exact CarePage name.</p>

<p><strong>(3)	Community Access CarePage</strong> Some Managers prefer to open their CarePage to a broader community of support by making their CarePage more accessible to other users of the Site. These Managers share the unique name of their CarePage publicly to invite a larger audience to view their information and provide support. With the Community Access option, a link to your CarePage may display as a search result when a user’s search criteria matches the health condition you indicated for your CarePage or the healthcare organization sponsoring the CarePages website where you created your CarePage. If Community Access is not enabled, members may informally open the access to their CarePage by sending invite emails to members of their extended community. Members who opt for a Community Access CarePage still maintain control over the Guestbook and can block and remove individuals. To protect the privacy of children and infants on the Web, we do not offer the Community Access option for CarePages that are created for children younger than 13 years of age.</p>

<p>Note some CarePages Sites are provided by healthcare sponsors (typically hospitals) (“Healthcare Sponsors”) that choose to offer only the Friends &amp; Family Access and Invitation Only privacy options.  </p>
<h3><strong>4. Visitor Information</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A. Visitor Guestbook.</strong>Whenever a visitor visits a CarePage, the Manager of the applicable CarePage is provided the following information: the name and email of the visitor, the time and date of the last visit and the total number of visits to the CarePage website by the visitor.  The Manager of the CarePages website may also choose to have the name of the visitor displayed on the CarePages website.</p>

<p><strong>B. Posts. </strong>You can place a post on a CarePage. Any posting you make will be associated with your first and last names and the time and date of the posting. The posting will be viewable to other visitors of the CarePage. When you voluntarily contribute to a CarePage, please be conscious of the access level of the CarePage and who might see the information you provided.  You also have the option to make a message private and viewable only to the Manager by checking the box under the message that reads, “Check this to post a private message - only you and the CarePage Manager will be able to view it.”</p>

<h3 id="how_we_use_info"><strong>5. How We Use Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>We will use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the time that the information is collected.</p>
<p><strong>A. Advertising.</strong>We believe that advertising is more interesting to you when it is relevant. Accordingly, we customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you provide us (e.g., age, gender, stated health interests and other information in your profile); (ii) geographic location information, which we may determine through your IP address, from your mobile device, or other ways; (iii) data we receive from third parties or; (iv) your visits on the Site or use of Services (commonly referred to as "Behavioral Advertising"). Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising section below for more information on the use of cookies and the information collected for Behavioral Advertising.

<h3 id="cookies_web_beacons"><strong>6. Cookies and Targeted Advertising</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A. Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Address Information</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. We may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Sites and Services. For example, we may use cookies to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times. For contests or sweepstakes, we may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls, we may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.</li>
  <li>Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser's directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Sites, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Sites may not work properly, and you may not be able to access our Services</li>
  <li>We may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Site and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs</li>
  <li>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Sites or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B. Targeted Advertising</strong></p>

<p>Companies Everyday Health works with may use cookies for purposes including understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Sites, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Site, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on our Site with information about pages you visit on other websites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with our vendor. You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Sites by clicking here and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests.  If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p>

<p>We adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click here).</p>

<p><strong>C. Information Collected by Third Party Advertisers</strong></p>

<p>Advertisers or other third parties on the Sites may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. We do not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI Opt-Out website and DAA Choice Page and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests.  If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p>

<h3><strong>7. How We Disclose Information to Third Parties</strong></h3>

<p><strong>E. Sponsors, Merchants and other ways that you approve at the time of collection.</strong></p>

<p>We may collect Personal Information about you and share it with third parties to the extent that you give us permission at the time of collection. For example, if you purchase a deal or service, we will provide your information to the applicable merchant or vendor.  We also sometimes gather Personal Information on behalf of a sponsor in association with a promotion.  In such a case, we will provide you notice at the time of collection that the information is being collected on the sponsor's behalf and link to the sponsor's privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>F. Within our Company; Changes to our Company.</strong></p>

<p>We may share your Personal Information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Policy. </p>

<h3><strong>8. Message Boards and Chats</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>11. Co-branded Sections of the Sites </strong></h3>

<p>Certain portions of the Site may be co-branded with a business partner and subject to a different privacy policy that is either the partner's privacy policy or a privacy policy developed jointly by Everyday Health and our partner (collectively the "Co-branded Policy"). The partner's collection, use and dissemination practices regarding any data or Personal Information provided by, or obtained from users of these Co-branded portions of the Site will be governed by the Co-branded Policy. Please read the Co-branded Policy for each Co-branded Site before providing any Personal Information. </p>

<h3><strong>12. Third Party Links</strong></h3>

<p>The Sites may link to websites operated by third parties that we do not control. For example, the Site provides you the ability to send gifts through the CarePages Gift Shop or to purchase a Keepsake Book. Both these services are operated by third-parties.  We do not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices. This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Sites or Services and does not apply to these third party websites. The ability to access information of third parties from the Site or Services, or links to other websites or locations, is for your convenience only and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their products, services, websites, locations or their content.  Please review the privacy policy of the third-party operator before completing any purchase. </p>

We also use secure server software (SSL) to process all financial transactions that occur on the Site.  SSL technology can encrypt Personal Information transmitted over the Internet. However, no security system is impenetrable. We do not warrant the security of our servers, nor do we warrant that your information, including Personal Information, will be completely secure or not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. </p>
