<h3 id="privacy_info_collect">Information collection and use</h3>
<p>We collect personal and non-personal information to customize the content and advertising you see, fulfill your requests for products or services, improve our services, and contact you. We also may use your information to pre-fill fields to save you from entering the same information over and over again. By knowing about you, we can deliver more helpful information, programs and tools, and offer you the most relevant services.  We collect personally identifiable information about you only when you provide it to us.</p>

<h3>Information we collect</h3>
<h4>Registration:</h4>
<p>There are many aspects of our site that can be enjoyed as a visitor, but in order to either manage or visit a personal CarePages website or make a posting to any public area of the Site (e.g., posting to a blog or discussion forum), you will need to register.  When you register, we will ask for your first and last name, date of birth, zip code, country of residence, a valid email address and a password for future access.  We use the registration and profile information (described below) for the purpose for administering and improving the Site and to deliver the most relevant content and advertising to you.</p>

<h4>My Profile:</h4>
<p>Upon registration, some of the information you provide is automatically populated into your profile (e.g., your first and last name, date of birth and location).  In addition, by clicking on Edit My Profile, you can tell us more about yourself.  For example, you may be able to upload your photograph, provide your gender, a narrative autobiography, or create a display name.  </p>
<p>Before you add any information to your profile, you will be able to select whether you want your profile to be public or private.  Some parts of a public profile are made available to Site users through the Site search function or links on the Site, (e.g., clicking on your display name as it appears in a forum or associated with a blog).  When a Site user accesses a public profile, the user will be able to see your display name and location, and to the extent that you have provided the information, your photo and biography.  No other information (e.g., your actual name, date of birth, email address) is made available to the public.  If you prefer that no information is made public, simply select the Private profile setting.</p>
<p>It might be easier to think about public and private profiles like this: when a profile is private, you can find other like you, but no one can find you.  When a profile is public, you can find others like you and others can find you.</p>

<h4>Health Interests</h4>
<p>Within the My Dashboard, members have the option to indicate Health Interests.  Your health interest(s) are not displayed anywhere on the Site, but they do allow us to customize your experience on the Site and to provide relevant articles, tips or advertising.</p>

<h3>Managers: Creating and Updating a CarePages Website</h3>
<h4>What is a CarePages Website?</h4>
<p>Personal CarePages websites are free, self-created web pages that serve as private "communications centers".  CarePages websites connect people struggling with health problems (both patients and those who care for them) with relatives, friends and other supporters.  The Site provides a platform for people to create, manage and visit CarePages websites.</p>

<h4>Patient Consent Required</h4>
<p>CarePages websites can be created by the patient or a loved one.  If you are creating a CarePages website on someone else's behalf, you must first receive the consent of the patient - and provide proof of the patient's consent in the event that we request it.</p>

<h4>Levels of Access.</h4>
<p>Given the sensitive nature of the information contained on a CarePages website, we want you to control who has access to your</p>

<h4>CarePages website</h4>
<p>When you create a CarePages website, you will select the level of access.  There are three levels of access: Private, Restricted and Open.  Please see the section on Choice and Control over Privacy below for more information on the levels of access so you can choose the appropriate access level for your CarePages website.</p>

<h4>Getting ready to create your CarePages website</h4>
<p>Before you can create a CarePages website, we ask you to provide information about the patient including the patient's name, location, website type (e.g., adult, newborn, child or pregnancy) health facility and health condition.  Unless you otherwise post the health condition on the CarePages website you manage, the health condition will not appear on the Site.  If, however, you have selected the Open Access option, a link to your CarePages website may display as a search result when a user's search criteria matches the health condition.  This allows users to more easily find others in a similar situation.</p>

<h4>Hospital Sponsors</h4>
<p>Some CarePages websites are provided by Hospital Sponsors with branding from both the organization and CarePages.com (co-branding).  There is no personally identifiable information passed to these Hospital Sponsors, however, we may share information in aggregate with the healthcare organization.  If you have selected the Open Access option for your CarePages website, a link to your CarePages website may display as a search result when a user's search criteria matches the healthcare organization.  This allows users to more easily find others in a similar situation.</p>

<h4>Naming your CarePages website</h4>
<p>We also ask you to create a name for your CarePages website.  Except for Open Access CarePages websites, CarePages website names are not available to the general public. Depending on the level of access, a user may need to know the CarePages Website name in order to access your CarePages website.</p>

<h4>Creating your CarePages website</h4>
<p>As a Manager, during the initial creation or as part of any update, you can control the information that is displayed on a CarePages website by clicking on About the Patient. You can provide information about a patient including his or her name, photo, story, date of birth, gender, visitor information, and email address.  Any information that you post to your CarePages website will be made available to visitors who are provided access to that CarePages website. You can access, manage, change or delete your contact information at any time by visiting the About the Patient section. Please think carefully about the access level of your CarePages website before you disclose any personal and/or health information on your CarePages website, as what you write is available to others who may use the information for unauthorized purposes.</p>
<p>We understand that the information posted on CarePages websites is often sensitive and intended solely for family and friends.  Accordingly, we note that any information contained on a CarePages Website will not be visible to third party search engines like Google, Yahoo! and MSN.  We may use the information on CarePages websites for improving our Site and services, but we do not use the information to target advertising.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Visitor Messages:</span> As a visitor to any CarePages website, you can communicate with the Manager or Patient in several ways. </p>
<p>(a) Post.  You can place a post on the CarePages website.  Any posting you make will be associated with your first and last names and the time and date of the posting.  The posting will be viewable to other visitors of the CarePages website, but it will not otherwise be available on the internet. When you voluntarily contribute to a CarePages website, please keep in mind that the information you disclose can be collected and used by others who visit that CarePages website and could be used for unauthorized purposes.  Please be conscious of the access level of the CarePages website and who might see the information.</p>
<p>(b) Private Message.  You also have the option to make a message private and viewable only to the Manager by checking the box under the message that reads, "Check this to post a private message - only you and the CarePages website Manager will be able to view it."</p>
<p>(c) Email.  If allowed by the Manager, visitors will also have the ability to send email to the Manager.  You may be able to access the Manager's email address via the About the Patient Section.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Visitor Guestbook.</span>  Whenever a visitor visits a CarePages website, the Manager of the applicable CarePages website is provided the following information: the name and email of the visitor, the time and date of the last visit and the total number of visits to the CarePages website by the visitor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Visitor Referrals:</span> Anyone who visits the Site can use our "Tell a Friend" referral feature to inform their friends and family about our service. This feature allows people to send a one-time email invitation to visit the Site. The email addresses that are entered through this feature will be used strictly for this purpose and will not be retained.  </p>
<p>If a Manager chooses to invite friends and family members to a CarePages website, we ask for their email addresses. We will automatically send those individuals a one-time email inviting them to visit the CarePages website. Visitor names, email addresses and date of last visit are recorded and viewable by the Manager.  The email addresses that are entered through this feature will be used strictly for this purpose and will not be retained. For Restricted Access CarePages websites, we do store the email addresses of approved visitors to determine who has been approved to visit that CarePages website. These individuals may contact CarePages at any time to request the removal of their information from our database at <a href="mailto:privacy@CarePages.com">privacy@CarePages.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Opinions, polls and surveys:</span> Occasionally, you may be asked to give your opinion when you visit the Site. We use information from opinion polls to better understand the needs of our users and to gather information about health care trends and issues. Questions and answers are stored, but they are not linked to identifying information about you. </p>
<p>You may be offered the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to the hospital or healthcare institution through an online survey. Your feedback will be transmitted only to the hospital referenced in the survey.  If you would like the hospital to contact you regarding the survey, you may provide your name and email address to the hospital so that the hospital can follow up with you regarding your survey feedback. If you provide your name and email address with your survey, the information we provide to the hospital will not be anonymous. A convenient link or instructions will be provided on such emails for recipients to remove themselves from these communications.</p>
<p>We may occasionally send emails to registered members to request feedback about our service. These surveys are used solely for the purpose of improving our Site. A convenient link or instructions will be provided on such emails for recipients to remove themselves from these communications.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Contests and sweepstakes:</span> When you enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us and/or one of our partners, we may ask you to provide additional information or answer certain questions in order to participate in a promotion. We may contact you in connection with a particular contest or sweepstakes in order to update your status, administer the promotion, let you know that a promotion has ended, and for other prize fulfillment needs or contest and sweepstakes related messages.  If we plan to use any information that you provide as part of content or sweepstakes differently than we describe here, we will let you know at the time we collect the information. </p>
<p><span class="bold">Search:</span> When you conduct a search on the Site, we may store the search terms and the site(s) visited so that we can continuously improve the quality of our search results. We may also target advertisements and sponsorship messages based upon your search criteria. </p>
<p><span class="bold">Special note for parents:</span> This site is a general audience site and not designed or intended to attract children younger than 13. We do not collect personal information from any person we actually know is younger than 13.  Parents and guardians permitting those children who are 13 years of age or younger to use the Site, should be aware that any information voluntarily given by children in chat sessions, email exchanges or message boards may be viewed by third parties.  If you have any questions regarding children's privacy, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@CarePages.com">privacy@CarePages.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Health tools and community features:</span> Throughout the Site, there may be health tools, questionnaires, and community features that ask for additional information, including your contact information, demographic information, personal health information, goals, family medical history, and vital statistics. In most cases, you can use health tools as a visitor, but saving and retrieving your results requires you to register and log into the site.</p>
<p><span class="bold">CarePages Gift Shop:</span> As a convenience to you, the Site provides you the ability to send gifts through the CarePages Gift Shop.  The Gift Shop is operated by a third-party.  While we may receive aggregated, non-personal information from the Gift Shop operator regarding gift purchases, we do not have access to, and we do not store, any information you provide related to purchases made in the Gift Shop.  Use of the information you provide is governed entirely by the privacy policy of the company that operates the gift shop.  Please review the privacy policy of the third-party operator before completing any purchase.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Log information:</span> When you visit our site, our servers will automatically collect log information. This information may include your Web page request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet Service Provider (ISP), platform type, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, the number of clicks you make on the Site, the website from which you came and to which you leave, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We collect log information so that we can properly administer our system and gather aggregate information about how our site is being used, including the pages visitors are viewing. DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner, may use your IP address to determine your approximate geographic location in order to provide you with location-relevant advertising.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cookies:</span> We and our advertisers collect anonymous information about your use of our site through cookies. The cookie does not tell us who you are. Only you can tell us that.</p>
<p>The information collected by cookies may be used to help us generate customized content that is more appropriate for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site and for what purpose. For contests or sweepstakes, we may use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls, we may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store any identifying information in any cookies on your computer.</p>
<p>Our Web advertising partners, such as DoubleClick and PointRoll, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to control the sequence of advertisements you see and to make sure you don't see the same ad too many times. DoubleClick does not use information collected via these cookies in its advertising network. To turn off DoubleClick cookies, please visit the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/">DoubleClick</a>  website. If you opt out of DoubleClick cookies, you will still see advertisements on our site. These ads will be targeted only on the basis of the non-personal information that is automatically transmitted on the Internet, such as information collected in our Web logs and the approximate geographic location of your computer. To turn off PointRoll cookies, please visit the <a href="http://www.pointroll.com/" target="_blank">PointRoll </a> website.</p>
<p>We also have agreements with companies, sometimes called "Ad Networks," that serve advertising on behalf of third parties. These Ad Networks may place or recognize a unique cookie, sometimes called a "third party cookie," on your browser. Ad Networks use cookies to understand Web usage patterns of people who see advertisements, to control the sequence of advertisements you see, to provide you with the most relevant advertising, and to make sure you don't see the same ad too many times. Ad Networks may connect information about pages you visited on our site with information about pages you visit on other sites and show you advertising based on this combined information. While we do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect, we have relationships only with organizations that have agreed to participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and abide by NAI principles, which prohibit members from connecting personally identifiable information to information they collect through cookies without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by DoubleClick or Ad Networks, please go to the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out </a>site and follow the instructions on that site. After you opt out, you will still see advertising on our site, but this advertising will not be tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. Please see our Advertising policy [link to: http://www.carepages.com/advertising-policy] for more information about our relationship with advertisers.</p>
<p>Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies or to accept cookies only from our site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, you may not be able to log in or use certain functions and conveniences of our site.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Web beacons:</span> We - and our advertisers - also use Web beacons, sometimes called single-pixel GIFs, that momentarily direct your browser to a server other than the Site in a way that may not be apparent to you. Web beacons are used to count users who visited specific pages and determine which emails were opened and/or acted upon when we send HTML-formatted email messages. We do not link any identifying information to Web beacons.</p>
<h3 id="privacy_info_third_party">Information that we obtain from third parties</h3>
<p>We may use your Zip code to obtain additional information about people in your neighborhood. This is average information for people who live within your 5 or 9-digit ZIP code (ZIP+4). The information can include average household income, presence and age(s) of children, presence and age(s) of elderly parents, size and value of dwellings, and other census data. We will use this information, combined with information you provide to us and information collected by our systems, to better understand the characteristics of the visitors to our site and to develop new products, services and content areas. The information will also allow us to tailor content, advertising and offers to your interests and needs.</p>
<p>When we associate information that we obtain from third parties with personal information that we have collected under this policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves. We will not share information we obtain from third parties in personally identifiable form. However, we may share aggregated, non-personal information, as described in this policy - that may include information we obtained from third parties in a form that does not permit you to be identified.</p>
<h3>Information disclosure to third parties</h3>
<p>We know how important it is to keep the information you've entrusted to us confidential. We will not rent, sell or share personal information about you with third parties except to provide you with a product or service you request or under certain circumstances as described below. In all other cases, we will ask for your permission before we disclose your personal information.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Disclosure for legal reasons:</span> We may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, a threat to homeland security, a threat to our system or network, or cases in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Agents and contractors:</span> Contractors sometimes have access to your personal information in the course of assisting in operating our business and providing products or services to you. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our site. Some of these relationships may be with companies that co-brand portions of their site and services, or that provide services to you on our behalf. Co-branded sites may have their own privacy policies posted on their sites. If you visit a co-branded site, please read the privacy policy that is posted on that site. Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function. Contractors have an obligation under their contracts with us to keep your information confidential and to comply with our privacy and security policies.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Aggregated, non-personal information:</span> We may share aggregated information about you with third parties. This is information that is combined with the non-personal information of other users and does not allow you to be identified or contacted. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information. We also may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Contests and sweepstakes:</span> Some or all of the information collected during a contest or sweepstakes may be disclosed publicly. It may also be shared with a co-sponsor(s) or a provider(s) of prizes in order to update you of your status, administer the promotion, let you know that a promotion has ended or for other prize fulfillment needs as indicated on the entry form. If data will be disclosed or shared, we will include a notice at the time of data collection.<br>
  Opinions, polls and surveys.  As noted above, you may be offered the opportunity to provide feedback to a hospital or healthcare institution through an online survey. Your feedback will be transmitted only to the hospital referenced in the survey.  If you provide your name and email address to the hospital as part of the survey, the information provided will not be anonymous and the hospital may contact you to follow-up on the survey.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Changes in our corporate structure:</span> If all or part of our company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the personal information you have provided at this site may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will take steps to ensure that, without your consent, any personal information that is transferred will not be used or shared in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected.</p>
<h3 id="privacy_choices">Choice and control over Privacy</h3>
<p><span class="bold">CarePages websites.</span>  As noted above, Managers may choose from three options to control access to his or her CarePages website:</p>
<h4>Restricted Access CarePages Websites</h4>
<p>CarePages websites with restricted access require the website Manager to invite and approve all visitors before they can access the restricted CarePages website. Access to any restricted CarePages website is at the discretion of the website Manager.  The Restricted Access CarePages website is not available via the Site search function.</p>
<h4>Private Access CarePages Websites</h4>
<p>To access a private access CarePages website, all registered user must know the exact name of the CarePages website and enter it into the Site search function. </p>
<h4>Open Access CarePages Websites</h4>
<p>Some Managers prefer to open their CarePages to a broader community of support by making their CarePages websites more accessible to other registered users of the Site.  These Managers share the unique name of their CarePages websites publicly to invite a larger audience to view their information and provide support.  Mangers may choose to open their CarePages websites to enable access for all other registered users of the CarePages community by selecting the Open Access option at the time the CarePages website is created or at any other time.  Members may also informally open the access to their CarePages website by sharing it with members of their extended community or media.  Members who opt for an Open Access CarePages website still maintain control over the Guestbook and can block and remove individuals at any time.  To protect the privacy of children and infants on the Web, we do not offer an "Open" privacy option for CarePages websites that are for children younger than 14 years of age.  Open Access CarePages websites are searchable via the CarePages Search Feature using the following queries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CarePages Website Name</li>
  <li>Website Manager Name</li>
  <li>Patient Name (if different than Website Manager)</li>
  <li>Healthcare Facility</li>
  <li>Location</li>
  <li>Health Condition</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">CarePages Website Names.</span>  In order to increase access control, every CarePages website has a unique name that is chosen by the Manager.  Anyone wishing to visit a CarePages website must know the exact name of the CarePages website.  Under no circumstances, will we release CarePages website names to visitors making telephone or technical support requests.  If the CarePages website is designated as "Open Access" by the Manager, the CarePages website may be located through the Site search function. </p>
<p>If you do not know or have forgotten a CarePages website name, you must contact the Manager for this information. Visitors can send a request to the Manager through our online <a href="/help_requests">Customer Support form</a>. The CarePages website Manager will handle the request as they wish.</p>
<h4>Communications</h4>
<p><span class="bold">Email communications:</span> Email communication that you send to us via the email links on our site may be shared with a Customer Care representative, employee, or the medical expert that is most likely to be able to address your inquiry. If you provide personal health information in your email, it will be used only for the purposes of answering your email. From time to time, we may send you service-related emails, such as a welcome email when you register with our site.  If you have joined a CarePages website, you will automatically receive an email notification each time the Manager updates their site.  To opt-out of the email notifications, uncheck the box labeled "Receive email alerts" next to the CarePages website name on My Dashboard. </p>
<p>We may also send to you an email on behalf of hospital sponsors that are related to a media event associated with the hospital sponsored CarePages service.  If you are interested in participating in the media event, we will provide you with information to contact the appropriate person at the hospital.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Newsletters:</span> At various places on the site, you may be given the option to receive newsletters. In addition, we distribute a complimentary newsletter to all registered users. This complimentary newsletter highlights new ways that you can interact with one another, content on how to give and receive support, and new functionality that is available on the Site. You can unsubscribe from any newsletter by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any newsletter or by visiting “My Profile” and clicking on “My Account Settings”.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Community:</span>  Our site features Community areas where people with similar health and wellness interests can share information and support one another. We have blogs, forums, public profiles, and stories. Please remember that any information that you post in public areas such as forums and public group discussions is, by design, open to the public and may appear in search engine results.  You can increase the Privacy of your posting by making the posting using your display and ensuring that your profile is set to "Private".</p>
<h3 id="privacy_security">Efforts we take to safeguard your personal information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We are committed to protecting the security of your information through procedures and technology designed for this purpose by taking these steps:</li>
  <li>We limit access to your personal information to employees having a reasonable need to access this information to provide products and services to you.</li>
  <li>Employees who misuse information are subject to disciplinary action, including termination.</li>
  <li>We have physical, technical and procedural safeguards to help protect your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>In areas that contain your personal information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to help protect this information while it is in transit between our servers and your computer.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Choose your passwords carefully:</span> Always create a password that's easy for you to remember but difficult for someone else to figure out. Don't use your name, address, phone number, initials, Social Security number, license plate or birthday. Don't use names of your friends, family or pets, company names, common numerical sequences or the word "password."</p>
<p><span class="bold">Suggestion:</span> Use a mix of special characters, numbers, and upper- and lowercase letters. Also, remember to change your password frequently and never give your password to anyone.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Log out and close your browser:</span> Open browsers invite snoops. When you finish your online session, close your browser to erase any information it may have temporarily stored on your computer.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Install antivirus software and spyware protection:</span> Viruses are dangerous. Many viruses are sent as email attachments. They can slip into your system without your knowledge the moment you open the email. Some viruses such as Trojan Horses can capture the contents of your system, including your passwords. Installing up-to-date antivirus software and running it will help thwart these and other unwanted programs.</p>
<p>Spyware is a program or technology that aids in gathering information about a person or organization, often without their knowledge, and includes programs like hijackers and keyloggers. The best way to identify whether or not spyware is installed on your computer is to run and regularly update antispyware programs. Similar to antivirus software, antispyware software identifies and helps you remove spyware.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Closing your account:</span> In the event that you would like to close your account, you can do so by writing <a href="mailto:help@carepages.com">help@carepages.com</a> or by calling CarePages customer support.  We will make your registration, profile and health interest information, and any CarePages website that you manage, inaccessible to other users within two business days.  We may, however, retain this information in conformance with our data retention policy in our systems and it may be retrieved in the event that you would like to register again for our services.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Changes to this Policy:</span> We may update this Policy. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address specified in your account. We may also make nonmaterial changes to our Policy that generally will not affect our use of your personal information. If you don't agree with the new policy, you always have the option of closing your account. Please see instructions for closing your account above. Our current policy, identified by its effective date, will be posted on the Site, and you should check it frequently. </p>
