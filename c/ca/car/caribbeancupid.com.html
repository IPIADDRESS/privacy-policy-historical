 share our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with
 any of our parent companies and/or subsidiaries throughout the world. To the
 extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it
 at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other
 members. Our parent and/or subsidiaries will follow privacy practices no less
 protective of all members than our practices described in this document, to the
 extent allowed by applicable law. It is possible that
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> and/or its subsidiaries, or any
 combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity.
 Should such a combination occur, you should expect that
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> would share some or all of your
 information in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive notice
 of such event, if it occurs, and of any changes to this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
 <p><u><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Legal Requests</span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">.
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> cooperates with law enforcement
 inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as intellectual
 property rights, fraud and other rights. You authorize us to disclose any
 information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we,
 in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an
 investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity
 that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability. </span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">YOUR
 USE OF OTHER MEMBERS’ INFORMATION</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Our services may also
 include access to instant messaging and chat rooms. As a member you have access
 to other members’ nicknames, and you might gain access to other contact
 information of members through the use of instant messaging and chat rooms. By
 accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that any personally identifiable
 information that you obtain through instant messaging communication, chat rooms
 and email may be used only for: (a) Website-related communications that are not
 unsolicited commercial messages, and (b) any other purpose that such member
 expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s). In all cases,
 you must give members an opportunity to remove themselves from your database and
 a chance to review what information you have collected about them. In addition,
 under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose
 personally identifiable information about another member to any third party
 without our consent and the consent of such other member after adequate
 disclosure.
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> and our members do not tolerate
 spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add an
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> member to your mail list (email or
 physical mail) without their express written consent after adequate disclosure.
 To report spam from other
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> members, please

 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
 ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Following registration,
 you can review and change the information you submitted during registration,
 such as your password, e-mail address, name, address, city, state, zip code,
 country, phone number, profile, likes and dislikes, desired date profile, and
 essays. In the event of such changes, we may keep track of your old information.<span style="">&nbsp;
 </span>Upon your written request, we will terminate your membership and remove
 all contact and financial information from our active databases as soon as
 reasonably possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We may retain in our files
 certain information you have requested to remove, in order to resolve disputes,
 troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior
 information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and
 legal constraints, including stored 'back up' systems. Therefore, you should not
 expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely
 removed from all backup databases in response to your requests. </span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">CONTROL
 OF YOUR PASSWORD</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">You are responsible for
 all actions taken with your login information and password, including fees.
 Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose your Website password or login
 information to any third parties. If you choose to share this information with
 third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all
 actions taken with your login information and password and therefore should
 review each third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password,
 you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information
 and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore,
 if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
 contact us to <span style="color: blue;">
 <a href="http://www.caribbeancupid.com/contact.php"><span style="color: blue;">
 change your password here</span></a></span>. </span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">OTHER
 INFORMATION COLLECTORS</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Except as otherwise
 expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use
 and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you
 disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or
 on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use
 or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use
 third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> does not control the privacy
 policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you
 disclose your personal information to others. </span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
 SECURITY</span></p>
 <p>
 <st1:placename w:st="on"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
 Oistins</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> uses industry standard practices to
 safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information,
 including firewalls and Secure Socket Layers “SSL.”
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> strives to protect data against
 loss and unauthorized access. We employ security techniques to protect such data
 from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. However,
 data is always at risk on the internet, and "perfect security" does not exist.
 </span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">NOTICE</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We may change this Privacy
 Policy from time to time. All changes to this policy are effective after we
 provide you with at least (30) days notice of changes by sending email to
 members. We provide you with (30) days notice to allow you the opportunity to
 notify
 <st1:placename w:st="on">Oistins</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">Bay</st1:placetype> if you do not agree to such
 changes. </span></p>
