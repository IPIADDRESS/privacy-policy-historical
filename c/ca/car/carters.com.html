						information. By visiting our website, you accept the
						practices described in this Privacy Policy. We will post

						<b>How we collect and use your personally identifying information</b><br>
						Carter's collects information from visitors to our website to assist them with their shopping experience. When you register we

					</p>
					
					<p>
						We also automatically gather statistical information about visitors to our website, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, 
						number of visitors and the like. However, we will not use your personally identifying information to identify this data. Instead, we 
						will combine this with other data and use it to determine how our website is used and how we may improve it. Your information is used 
						only by Carter's and is not sold, rented or distributed to any other companies.

					<p>
						<b>Links to non-Carter's websites</b><br>
						Our website, www.carters.com, may contain links to websites belonging to third parties. We are not responsible for these non-Carter's 
						websites, and you enter them at your own risk. Your personal information is protected as described in that website's privacy policy.

						<b>Website data security</b><br>
						We use reasonable and current security methods to protect your personally identifying information from unauthorized access, to maintain

						secured. Therefore, while we try to protect your personally identifying information, we cannot guarantee the security of the information 
						you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.
