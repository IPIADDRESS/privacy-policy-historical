A VIN is the most reliable way to identify an exact car, commercial vehicle, bus, truck or even trailer.\r\r\r\nManufacturers use customized VINs to encode (or “attach”) some important information about that particular vehicle in it. The most common practice is encoding the name of the manufacturer, model, and technical specifications in the VIN.\r\r\r\nHowever, Vehicle Identification Numbers are also used by repair services and law enforcement to record maintenance, inspection, damage, theft, and more. This makes it possible to retrieve important facts from the history of the car.","whatQuestion":"What is VIN?","whereAnswer":"A VIN can be found on the body of a vehicle or in its documents.\r\n\r\nThe exact location of the VIN differs from model to model, but it is typically located on the bottom-right corner of the windshield, in the engine compartment or on the lower part of the “B pillar”.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the VIN is engraved next to the spare wheel, on the floor panel below driver’s feet or even on the bonnet. Manufacturers usually place the VIN in 2-3 different locations.\r\n\r\nYou can confirm a Vehicle Identification Number by checking the field “E” of the European registration certificate.","whereQuestion":"Where can you find a VIN?"},"whySection":{"text":"carVertical is driven by the idea of data decentralisation and giving power to consumers. Our goal is to enable every car buyer around the globe to get authentic, reliable information about specific vehicles to help them make informed decisions.\r\r\r\r\ncarVertical gathers as much information as possible from different sources, including national and private registries, various databases and even on-board diagnostic (OBD) devices.\r\r\r\r\nWe process and verify all the data, and use blockchain to confirm its reliability.

NMVTIS is intended to serve as a reliable source of title and brand history for automobiles, but it does not contain detailed information regarding a vehicle’s repair history.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nAll states, insurance companies, and junk and salvage yards are required by federal law to regularly report information to NMVTIS. However, NMVTIS does not contain information on all motor vehicles in the United States because some states are not yet providing their vehicle data to the system. Currently, the data provided to NMVTIS by states is provided in a variety of time frames; while some states report and update NMVTIS data in “real-time” (as title transactions occur), other states send updates less frequently, such as once every 24 hours or within a period of days.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInformation on previous, significant vehicle damage may not be included in the system if the vehicle was never determined by an insurance company (or other appropriate entity) to be a “total loss” or branded by a state titling agency. Conversely, an insurance carrier may be required to report a “total loss” even if the vehicle’s titling-state has not determined the vehicle to be “salvage” or “junk”. Before making a decision to purchase a vehicle, consumers may wish to obtain an independent vehicle inspection, a NMVTIS Vehicle History Report, and consult other available vehicle information resources.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nThe information in NMVTIS includes:\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInformation from participating state motor vehicle titling agencies.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInformation on automobiles, buses, trucks, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, motor homes, and tractors. NMVTIS may not currently include commercial vehicles if those vehicles are not included in a state.s primary database for title records (in some states, those vehicles are managed by a separate state agency), although these records may be added at a later time.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInformation on “brands” applied to vehicles provided by participating state motor vehicle titling agencies. Brand types and definitions vary by state, but may provide useful information about the condition or prior use of the vehicle.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nMost recent odometer reading in the state’s title record. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nInformation from insurance companies, and auto recyclers, including junk and salvage yards, that is required by law to be reported to the system, beginning March 31, 2009.

Well, it helps to determine whether the VIN you are checking actually corresponds to the vehicle you are interested in. For example, there are cases of so called “twin models”, like Opel Insignia / Buick Regal or Toyota GT86 / Subaru BRZ, when cars share the majority of their mechanical components. Unfair car traders may want to switch the “identity” of a certain vehicle by replacing broken front grill, manufacturer badges or other design elements with relevant parts from a “twin model”.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nSo you may fall in love with Subaru while actually driving Toyota. Make sure you avoid such frauds by purchasing carVertical connected report™ in advance.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nAdditionally, this section provides you with carVertical score, which is a quick glimpse at overall condition of the vehicle. We comprise it by extracting damage data, mileage records and weak points of the model itself. Then add a little bit of carVertical magic and here we go – the reference score is ready.
