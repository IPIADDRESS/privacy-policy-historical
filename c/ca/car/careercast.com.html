</p><ol>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for a CareerCast account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you.<br><br>

</li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.<br><br>

</li><li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of CareerCast or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.<br><br>

Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the CareerCast Web site.

</p>

<p>
For each HTTP (which is what your Web browser generates when you request a page or part of a page from a Web Site) request received, we collect and store only the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The date and time
</li><li>The originating IP address

</li><li>The object requested
</li><li>Completion status of the request
</li><li>Pages visited
</li><li>Cookies
</li></ul>
<h4>How the Information is Used</h4>
<p>
We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our sites more useful to visitors.
