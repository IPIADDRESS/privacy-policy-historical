you emails containing the following types of information: notifications
of detected problems with your service; notifications concerning
the expiration of your account; activity status reports; service

    <strong>Carbonite's Commitment to the Security of your Personal
        Information</strong></p>
Carbonite has security measures in place to protect against
the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Information
in our customer database. Personal Information provided to Carbonite
is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized
personnel only. To provide secure credit card processing when
ordering, orders placed on our Website are processed through
a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy.
Carbonite does not store credit card information unless you
choose an automatic renewal subscription plan. If you choose
to purchase the software online using a credit card, the credit
card information is sent to Carbonite using SSL (Secure Socket
Layer) encryption, an industry-standard method for protecting
data as it travels over the Internet. Although we make good
faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in
a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized
users, we cannot guarantee complete security. We currently use
credit card processing services from VeriSign, Inc., our "payment
gateway." VeriSign, Inc. has its own privacy policy which may
be viewed at <a href="http://www.verisign.com/Privacy/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com/Privacy/index.html</a>

    <strong>Carbonite's Commitment to the Privacy and Security of your
        Backed Up Data</strong></p>
Carbonite has a number of security measures in place to protect
the privacy and security of your backed up data. Your data is
encrypted before it ever leaves your PC and encrypted again
using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) during transmission to our secure
data centers. Your encrypted backup files are stored in secure
facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only.
Carbonite will not share your encrypted files with any third
party unless such action is necessary to comply with a government
or court order legally compelling us to do so.<p>
    <strong>Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
By using the Website or any services provided through the Website,
you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information
as described in this Privacy Policy.
<p>
    <strong>Privacy Policy Revisions</strong></p>
Carbonite reserves the right to amend, revise or modify this
policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and
in any manner. In the event of material changes to this Privacy
Policy, Carbonite's customers will be notified via email at
least 30 days prior to the date on which those changes take

    <strong>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information </strong>

safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in
