<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Links to Other Websites</h2>

We have no control of or responsibility for linked websites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. You access such linked Websites at your own risk.

We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.</p>

<p>Also, we may contract with third-party service providers to provide certain services for our business, such as processing your financial information to determine credit-worthiness, credit card processing, computer system services, data management, or promotional services. We provide the information needed for these service providers to perform these services. The information we provide may include some of our customers' personal and Personally Identifiable Information. However, these service providers are not authorized to use any of the information we share with them for any purposes other than to provide services to us.</p>

<p>You understand that if you are seeking automotive financing, you may have one or more credit reports pulled by those of our affiliates who would offer you automotive financing or assist in the determination of providing you automotive financing.</p>

<p>We may share information that we have collected with governmental agencies and other organizations assisting us in fraud prevention or for investigative purposes. We may do so when permitted or mandated by law; trying to protect against or prevent fraud; attempting to prevent unauthorized or improper transactions; or investigating fraud or improper conduct that has already taken place.

Some advertisers use companies other than our Website to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on our Website.  In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the website of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected destination (e.g., back to our Website to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p>
<p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies or Web Beacons, or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through them.  However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through our Website to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our Website without your consent.</p>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>From time to time, our privacy and security practices may change. If we modify our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to address these changes, we will indicate when such changes are made by changing the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Those changes will be effective as of the Last Updated date. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of our Websites and will replace any prior policies that are inconsistent. We may change or add to this Privacy Policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically.</p>
