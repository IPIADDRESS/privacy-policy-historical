                        <p>You also may give Us permission to access Your information in other services. For example,
                            You may link Your Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus account to CareDash, which allows Us to
                            obtain information from those accounts. The information We get from those services often
                            depends on Your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>

                        <p>Maintaining Your trust is Our top priority, so We adhere to the following principles to
                            protect Your privacy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We protect Your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with
                                Your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry out Your instructions; (3) as
                                reasonably necessary in order to provide Our features and functionality to You; (4) when
                                We reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process; and/or (5)
                                as necessary to enforce Our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, or safety
                                of CareDash, Our Members and Visitors, and the public.
                            </li>

                            <li>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect Your information
                                in accordance with industry standards.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Information We Collect</h4>

                        <p><strong>Registration.</strong> To create an account on CareDash, You must provide Us with a
                            username, valid email address, and a password and agree to Our Terms of Use and this Privacy
                            Policy, which governs how We treat Your information. You may provide additional information
                            during registration (for example, financial information and information about Your
                            healthcare needs) to help You build Your profile and to provide You more customized Services
                            and Offers (for example, insurance offers and suggested healthcare providers). You
                            understand that, by creating an account, We will be able to identify You by Your CareDash
                            profile. We may also ask for Your credit card details if You purchase certain additional
                            services.</p>
                        <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

                        <p>CareDash collects personally identifiable information from Our Users at several different
                            points on CareDash, including, without limitation, when Users provide it to Us by (i)
                            contacting Us through email, (ii) registering for use of CareDash or (iii) submitting
                            information through any forms, interactive features or Services available on CareDash.</p>

                        <p>Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, Your name, mailing
                            address, telephone number, email address, credit card information or any other information
                            that might reasonably be used to identify You individually. When other information is
                            directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information becomes
                            personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy. We collect this personally
                            identifiable information when You, at any point, manually enter it into any online form
                            available on CareDash or voluntarily submit it to Us in another manner. We may also store
                            Your personally identifiable information in Our systems for use in other ways as described
                            in this Policy.</p>

                        <p>In order for You to take full advantage of CareDash You may be asked to voluntarily provide
                            Your personally identifiable information to Us. You may choose not to provide Us with Your
                            personally identifiable information by simply not entering it on CareDash or not otherwise
                            providing it to Us. While You still will have access to CareDash even if You do not provide
                            Us with Your personally identifiable information, You should understand that You will not be
                            able to use certain of the Services or features available through CareDash that require You
                            to enter Your personally identifiable information in order to function.</p>

                        <p><strong>Profile Information.</strong> After You create an account, You may choose to provide
                            additional information on Your CareDash profile, such as information about Your age, gender,
                            date of birth, ethnicity, relationship status, education level, employment status, financial
                            status, interests, and general overall health, including height, weight, physical health,
                            any medical conditions, allergies, lifestyle choices, eating habits, stress levels, sleep
                            health, personal care, health care, family health care, family members. Subject to the
                            settings You choose, Your connections may provide recommendations and offers for financial
                            and health services to You. Providing additional information enables You to derive more
                            benefit from Our Services by helping Us identify the types of services and information that
                            would be most helpful to You. It also enables Us to serve You ads and other relevant content
                            on and off of Our Services. Your profile will be entirely private. Your profile information
                            will be available neither to other users browsing the site, nor through search engines.</p>

                        <p><strong>Customer Service.</strong> When You contact Our customer support services, We may
                            have to access Your contributions to Our Services and collect the information We need to
                            categorize Your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of Our
                            Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential
                            problems and trends and customize Our support responses to better serve You. We do not use
                            this information for advertising.</p>

                        <p><strong>Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites.</strong> You allow Us to
                            receive information when You use Your account to log in to a third-party website or
                            application. You also allow Us to receive information about Your visits and interaction with
                            the sites and services of Our partners that include Our cookies and similar technologies,
                            unless You opt out.</p>

                        <p><strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong> If You do not input or otherwise submit any of
                            Your personally identifiable information, then the information We collect from You is
                            limited. For example, We log Your internet protocol (“IP”) address when You enter, use, and
                            leave the CareDash site in order to help Us diagnose problems with Our server, administer
                            CareDash and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time You visit, or it may
                            be the same, depending on whether You access CareDash through an always-on type of Internet
                            connection (such as cable or DSL), or through a dial-up connection. We match IP addresses to
                            completed User registration forms for validation and error checking purposes. If You reached
                            the Site by clicking on a link or ad from another site, then We may also log that
                            information. This helps Us maximize Our Internet exposure and to understand the interests of
                            Our Users. In general, this information is used to generate overall anonymous reports on Our
                            Users that enable Us to improve the effectiveness of CareDash.</p>

                        <p><strong>Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile
                                Device.</strong> When You visit or leave Our Services (whether as a Member or Visitor)
                            by clicking a hyperlink or when You view a third-party site that includes Our plugin or
                            cookies (or similar technology), We automatically receive the URL of the site from which You
                            came or the one to which You are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page
                            that You are on when You click an ad on or through Our Services. We also receive the IP
                            address of Your computer or the proxy server that You use to access the Internet, Your
                            computer operating system details, Your type of Internet browser, Your mobile device
                            (including Your mobile device identifier provided by Your mobile device operating system),
                            Your mobile operating system (if You are accessing CareDash using a mobile device), and the
                            name of Your internet service provider (“ISP”) or Your mobile carrier. We may also receive
                            location data passed to Us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that You have
                            set up, which We use to show You local information on Our mobile applications and for fraud
                            prevention and security purposes. Most mobile devices allow You to prevent real time
                            location data being sent to Us, and of course We will honor Your settings.</p>
                        <h4>Cookie Policy</h4>

                        <p>We often place a small file known as a "cookie" on Your computer's hard drive. A cookie may
                            contain information that allows Us to track Your path through CareDash and to determine
                            whether You have visited Us before. However, unless You provide Us with personally
                            identifiable information, the cookies will not contain any information that would allow Us
                            to personally identify You. If You do provide personally identifiable information to Us, the
                            cookie is tied to this information so that Our systems will recognize You each time You use
                            CareDash. In that way, We can save Your preferences from visit to visit and present You with
                            a customized version of CareDashYou every time You visit. Our cookies cannot be used to read
                            data from Your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by
                            other sites. We use cookies in this manner to help Us understand how Users use CareDash, and
                            to help Us to improve CareDash. You may refuse to accept a cookie from Us by following the
                            procedures for rejecting cookies specific to Your web browser.</p>

                        <p>We may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers to help analyze how Users use the
                            site and remarket the Users with customized Ads. We utilize the User ID feature of Google
                            Analytics to associate Your sessions, and activities in those sessions, across Your devices.
                            You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and customized Google Display
                            Network ads by visiting the Ads Preferences Manager.</p>

                        <p>If You visit the website of a third party by clicking on an external link on CareDash, they
                            may also use cookies on their website. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
                            This Policy covers the use of cookies by CareDash only and does not cover the use of cookies
                            by any advertisers or other third parties.</p>
                        <h4>User Activity Tracking</h4>

                        <p>We may employ software technology that enables Us to track certain aspects of a User's visit
                            to CareDash and may allow third parties to deploy such technology through advertisements
                            placed on the Site and other means. This technology helps Us better manage content on
                            CareDash by informing Us what content is effective. The software uses “trackers” to monitor
                            User activity. Trackers are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that
                            track usage activity including, but not limited to, which pages are viewed, when they are
                            viewed, and for how long the pages are viewed. User activity information may be associated
                            with additional information about a User's session, such as a User’s IP address and the type
                            of browser used, and personally identifiable information, if provided by the User. </p>

                        <p>If You arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another website, and You have registered
                            with that other website, then certain information about You that You provided to that other
                            website, such as the terms You were searching that led You to the Site, may be transmitted
                            to Us and We may use it as described in this Policy. You should review the privacy policy of
                            any website from which You reached the Site in order to determine what information was
                            collected by that website and for what purpose(s) You agreed that website could use that
                            information. We may or may not retain that information; if We do, then We may use it in
                            accordance with this Policy. This information may or may not be associated with other User
                            activity data or personally identifiable information.</p>

                        <p><strong>Advertising Technologies and Web Beacons.</strong> We target (and measure the
                            performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others, both on and off of Our Services through
                            a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using the following, whether separately or

                                aggregators) that We use in addition to the information from Our cookies (and similar
                                technologies), Your profile and use of Our Services.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> We may share Your personal information with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for
                            advertising. Also, advertising partners may associate personal information collected by the
                            advertiser directly from You with Our cookies and similar technologies.</p>
                        <h4>How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>

                        <p>We may use the information (whether or not personally identifiable) that You provide to Us

                        <p>We also customize Your experience and the experiences of others on Our Services. For example,

                            location regarding safety alerts or health service providers in Your area, e.g. We try to
                            show You content, such as news and presentations, that is relevant to You and Your specific
                            needs and concerns. We also may use Your information and content for invitations and
                            communications promoting Our Services or the Services of Our affiliates that are tailored to
                            You.

                            with CareDash) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You are consenting to this
                            sharing. We may combine information internally across different Services that We offer.

                            to CareDash relating to CareDash on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services
                            Ourselves. This includes, but is not limited to, contracting with: (i) an email provider to
                            handle the distribution of email messages to Users of CareDash, (ii) a website hosting

                            enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to Us. In addition,
                            all Users consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their information
                            (whether or not personally identifiable) by CareDash and these third party providers.

                            if We have a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably
                            necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to,
                            civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this
                            Privacy Policy or Our Terms of Use; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of
                            third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property,
                            or safety of CareDash, Our Services, Our Members, Visitors, or the public.

                        <p>We may support middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to legal

                            Your contacts in this way, You will be granting Your third party provider the right to

                        </p>

                        <p>We will share information provided by Users (whether or not personally identifiable) with

                            identifiable) with information from third party sources with whom We have contracted for the
                            purpose of verifying the contact information You have provided. You have the option not to

                        </p>

                        <p>We may also share information about Users (whether or not personally identifiable) with third

                            Your needs. If You would prefer not to have Your information shared with third parties, You
                            may opt out by emailing <a href="mailto: subscriptions@caredash.com">subscriptions@caredash

                        <h4>Consent to Telemarketing Calls</h4>

                        <p>Further, by registering on this Site, You agree that this act constitutes an inquiry and/or
                            application for purposes of telemarketing laws, and notwithstanding that Your telephone
                            and/or cell number may be listed with the federal Do-Not-Call Registry, You expressly opt-in
                            to: (a) receive an offer or service from one or more of Our partners or affiliates; (b)
                            receive future information about products and Services from Us, Our partners, affiliates and
                            other third parties to whom We may provide Your information; (c) permit Us, Our partners,
                            affiliates and other third parties to contact You pursuant to the business relationship We
                            have established using the information You provided to Us for any purpose such as contacting
                            You by email address, phone and/or mobile phone number (including use of automated dialing
                            equipment), text (SMS) message or any means of communication for any purpose that, among
                            other things, Your wireless device may be capable of receiving (e.g. mms, video etc.). You
                            may revoke authorization for Us to contact You by such means at any time (see the Opting Out
                            section below).
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests.</strong> From time-to-time CareDash will request personally
                            identifiable information from Users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys
                            or contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to
                            disclose personally identifiable information. The requested information typically includes
                            contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic and location
                            information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest or
                            survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for
                            purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of CareDash. Users' personally
                            identifiable information collected through surveys or contests is not shared with third
                            parties who are not agents or service providers, unless We give prior notice and receive
                            Your permission for the sharing. Though We may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys
                            or contests, these intermediaries will not use the Users' personally identifiable
                            information for any secondary purposes.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Polls and Surveys.</strong> Polls and surveys may be conducted by Us, Members, or
                            third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to You on the results page based
                            on Your answers in the poll. We or third parties may follow up with You via email or
                            messages delivered through Our Service. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to
                            You to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires Your contact
                            information, You may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling
                            the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and
                            verifying Your contact information. It is up to You whether You provide this information, or
                            whether You desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personal
                            information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by
                            the party conducting it. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing Your
                            settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.

                            closed Your account or deleted the information from Your own profile. In addition, You may
                            not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about You that other Members
                            copied or exported out of Our Services, because this information may not be in Our control.

                        <p><strong>Minimum Age.</strong> As described in the Terms of Use, persons must be of Minimum

                        <h4>CareDash Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 13</h4>

                        <p>CareDash complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA requires
                            that website operators never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                            anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. The Site is not
                            intended for children under the age of 13, and CareDash does not knowingly collect or use
                            personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If We discover
                            personal data from a child under the age of 13, We will eliminate that data.
                        </p>

                        <p>You are not permitted to use CareDash if You are under the age of 13. By using CareDash, You
                            agree to provide Us with accurate information concerning Your age or identity if We request
                            it. You also agree not to assist children under the age of 13 in accessing CareDash or to
                            attempt to contact children under 13 through CareDash.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>California’s Shine the Light Law.</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83,
                            known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits Our customers who are California residents to
                            request and obtain from Us a list of what personal information (if any) We disclosed to
                            third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and
                            addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of
                            charge. Under Section 1798.83, We currently do not share any personal information with third
                            parties for their direct marketing purposes.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Security.</strong> CareDash will take reasonable measures to secure the personally
                            identifiable information Users provide to Us. However, CareDash cannot guaranty the security
                            of any information You submit to Us and You do so at Your own risk. All personally
                            identifiable information is protected by password and accessible only to authorized CareDash
                            personnel. However, there is a possibility that Internet transmissions containing a User's
                            personally identifiable information may be intercepted by others. There is no way for Us to
                            ensure the privacy of User information before it arrives at CareDash or after it leaves
                            CareDash.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Changes to Policy.</strong> If We make material changes to this Policy, We will post
                            a notice on the home page regarding the amended Policy, so that You are aware of what
                            personally identifiable information We collect, how We use it, and under what circumstances,
                            if any, We disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please
                            review CareDash frequently for any changes. Amendments to this Policy will be posted on
                            CareDash and will be effective when posted. You will be deemed to have been made aware of,
                            will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the changes to any amended or
                            revised Policy by Your continued use of Our services or CareDash.
