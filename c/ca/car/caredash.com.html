Privacy Policy

<p class="no-margin">
Last Updated: May 30, 2019
</p>
</div>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
This privacy policy (this "Policy") covers the CareDash Web site www.CareDash.com and any
other sites operated under the name ("CareDash" or “the Site”) and any mobile app or other
service made available to You (“You”, “Your”, or “Yours”) by CareDash (collectively referred
to as the “Services”).
</p>
<p>
This Policy describes the types of information that CareDash ("CareDash", " We", "Us" or
"Our") gathers from You and the other people who use CareDash (the "Users"), how We may use
that information and how You can contact Us regarding this Policy and Your personal
information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Your Consent.
</strong>
Please read this entire Policy carefully before using CareDash or providing Us
with any information. When You access or use CareDash, You consent to the collection, use
and disclosure of Your information in accordance with this Policy. By providing personal
information to CareDash, all Users fully understand and consent to the collection, use and
processing of such information by CareDash or third parties as set forth herein. If You do
not agree to the terms of this Policy, You are not authorized to use CareDash.
</p>
<p>
You also may give Us permission to access Your information in other services. For example,
You may link Your Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus account to CareDash, which allows Us to
obtain information from those accounts. The information We get from those services often
depends on Your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining Your trust is Our top priority, so We adhere to the following principles to
protect Your privacy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We protect Your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with
Your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry out Your instructions; (3) as
reasonably necessary in order to provide Our features and functionality to You; (4) when
We reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process; and/or (5)
as necessary to enforce Our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, or safety
of CareDash, Our Members and Visitors, and the public.
</li>
<li>
We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect Your information
in accordance with industry standards.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nufit Media Inc. is the parent company of CareDash.
</p>
<h2>
Information We Collect
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
Registration.
</strong>
To create an account on CareDash, You must provide Us with a&nbsp;valid email address, and a
password and agree to Our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, which governs how We treat
Your information. You may provide additional information during registration (for example,
information about Your healthcare needs). For healthcare providers, You may provide additional
information about Your practice and statements about You (for example, Your personal
philosophy of care or Your hobbies and interests), and Profile pictures or pictures of Your
facilities (collectively, “Additional Healthcare Provider Information”). Additional Healthcare
Provider Information may be made available to other users browsing the site and search engines.
You understand that, by creating an account, We will be able to identify You by Your CareDash
Profile. We may also ask for Your credit card details if You purchase certain additional services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Personally Identifiable Information.
</strong>
CareDash collects personally identifiable information from Our Users at several different
points on CareDash, including, without limitation, when Users provide it to Us by (i)
contacting Us through email, (ii) registering for use of CareDash or (iii) submitting
information through any forms, interactive features or Services available on CareDash.
</p>
<p>
Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, Your name, mailing
address, telephone number, email address, credit card information or any other information
that might reasonably be used to identify You individually. When other information is
directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information becomes
personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy. We collect this personally
identifiable information when You, at any point, manually enter it into any online form
available on CareDash or voluntarily submit it to Us in another manner. We may also store
Your personally identifiable information in Our systems for use in other ways as described
in this Policy.
</p>
<p>
In order for You to take full advantage of CareDash You may be asked to voluntarily provide
Your personally identifiable information to Us. You may choose not to provide Us with Your
personally identifiable information by simply not entering it on CareDash or not otherwise
providing it to Us. While You still will have access to CareDash even if You do not provide
Us with Your personally identifiable information, You should understand that You will not be
able to use certain of the Services or features available through CareDash that require You
to enter Your personally identifiable information in order to function.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Profile for Healthcare Providers, Practices and Hospitals.
</strong>
CareDash aggregates information on healthcare providers, practices and hospitals from both
public and private sources, including the NPI Registry at
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/">https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/</a>
Since the information available is publicly available, CareDash’s policy is not to remove a Profile.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Customer Service.
</strong>
When You contact Our customer support services, We may
have to access Your contributions to Our Services and collect the information We need to
categorize Your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of Our
Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential
problems and trends and customize Our support responses to better serve You. We do not use
this information for advertising.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites.
</strong>
You allow Us to
receive information when You use Your account to log in to a third-party website or
application. You also allow Us to receive information about Your visits and interaction with
the sites and services of Our partners that include Our cookies and similar technologies,
unless You opt out.
</p>
<p>
We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site or
within our email newsletters. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies
to collect user information (e.g., hashed, de-identified, data, click stream information,
browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during
your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
services likely to be of greater interest to you.  To learn more about this behavioral
advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites
of the Digital Advertising Alliance at
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Non-Personal Information.
</strong>
If You do not input or otherwise submit any of
Your personally identifiable information, then the information We collect from You is
limited. For example, We log Your internet protocol (“IP”) address when You enter, use, and
leave the CareDash site in order to help Us diagnose problems with Our server, administer
CareDash and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time You visit, or it may
be the same, depending on whether You access CareDash through an always-on type of Internet
connection (such as cable or DSL), or through a dial-up connection. We match IP addresses to
completed User registration forms for validation and error checking purposes. If You reached
the Site by clicking on a link or ad from another site, then We may also log that
information. This helps Us maximize Our Internet exposure and to understand the interests of
Our Users. In general, this information is used to generate overall anonymous reports on Our
Users that enable Us to improve the effectiveness of CareDash.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile
Device.
</strong>
When You visit or leave Our Services (whether as a Member or Visitor)
by clicking a hyperlink or when You view a third-party site that includes Our plugin or
cookies (or similar technology), We automatically receive the URL of the site from which You
came or the one to which You are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page
that You are on when You click an ad on or through Our Services. We also receive the IP
address of Your computer or the proxy server that You use to access the Internet, Your
computer operating system details, Your type of Internet browser, Your mobile device
(including Your mobile device identifier provided by Your mobile device operating system),
Your mobile operating system (if You are accessing CareDash using a mobile device), and the
name of Your internet service provider (“ISP”) or Your mobile carrier. We may also receive
location data passed to Us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that You have
set up, which We use to show You local information on Our mobile applications and for fraud
prevention and security purposes. Most mobile devices allow You to prevent real time
location data being sent to Us, and of course We will honor Your settings.
</p>
<h2>
Cookie Policy
</h2>
<p>
We often place a small file known as a "cookie" on Your computer's hard drive. A cookie may
contain information that allows Us to track Your path through CareDash and to determine
whether You have visited Us before. However, unless You provide Us with personally
identifiable information, the cookies will not contain any information that would allow Us
to personally identify You. If You do provide personally identifiable information to Us, the
cookie is tied to this information so that Our systems will recognize You each time You use
CareDash. In that way, We can save Your preferences from visit to visit and present You with
a customized version of CareDashYou every time You visit. Our cookies cannot be used to read
data from Your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by
other sites. We use cookies in this manner to help Us understand how Users use CareDash, and
to help Us to improve CareDash. You may refuse to accept a cookie from Us by following the
procedures for rejecting cookies specific to Your web browser.
</p>
<p>
We may also use Google Analytics for Display Advertisers to help analyze how Users use the
site and remarket the Users with customized Ads. We utilize the User ID feature of Google
Analytics to associate Your sessions, and activities in those sessions, across Your devices.
You can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and customized Google Display
Network ads by visiting the Ads Preferences Manager.
</p>
<p>
If You visit the website of a third party by clicking on an external link on CareDash, they
may also use cookies on their website. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
This Policy covers the use of cookies by CareDash only and does not cover the use of cookies
by any advertisers or other third parties.
</p>
<h2>
User Activity Tracking
</h2>
<p>
We may employ software technology that enables Us to track certain aspects of a User's visit
to CareDash and may allow third parties to deploy such technology through advertisements
placed on the Site and other means. This technology helps Us better manage content on
CareDash by informing Us what content is effective. The software uses “trackers” to monitor
User activity. Trackers are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that
track usage activity including, but not limited to, which pages are viewed, when they are
viewed, and for how long the pages are viewed. User activity information may be associated
with additional information about a User's session, such as a User’s IP address and the type
of browser used, and personally identifiable information, if provided by the User.
</p>
<p>
If You arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another website, and You have registered
with that other website, then certain information about You that You provided to that other
website, such as the terms You were searching that led You to the Site, may be transmitted
to Us and We may use it as described in this Policy. You should review the privacy policy of
any website from which You reached the Site in order to determine what information was
collected by that website and for what purpose(s) You agreed that website could use that
information. We may or may not retain that information; if We do, then We may use it in
accordance with this Policy. This information may or may not be associated with other User
activity data or personally identifiable information. Note that your browser settings may
allow you automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites that you visit.
Like many websites, the Site is not currently configured to respond to Do Not Track signals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>

<p>
<strong>
Consent to CareDash Processing Information About You.
</strong>
By providing personal
information to Us when You create or update Your account, You are expressly and
voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of Our Terms of Use and freely accepting and
agreeing to Our processing of Your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy
Policy. Supplying to Us any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely
voluntary on Your part. You can withdraw or modify Your consent to Our collection and
processing of the information You provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this
Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, by changing Your account settings or by closing Your CareDash accounts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
CareDash Communications.
</strong>
We may communicate with You through email, notices
posted on the CareDash websites or apps, and other means available through the Services.
Examples of these communications include: (1) welcome and engagement communications -
informing You about how to best use Our Services, new features, updates about other Members
You are connected to and their actions, etc.; (2) service communications - these will cover
service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of Our Services; (3)
promotional communications - these include both email, and may contain promotional
information directly or on behalf of Our partners, including healthcare provider
information. These messages will be sent to You based on Your account information and
messaging preferences. You may change Your email and contact preferences at any time by
signing into Your account and changing Your CareDash email settings or by sending a written
request to CareDash’s physical address. You can
also opt out of promotional messages by
<a href="/contact-us">contacting Us.</a>
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that You cannot opt out of receiving service messages from Us.
</p>
<h2>
Communications From Us
</h2>
<p>
We will also communicate with You in response to Your inquiries, to provide the services You
request, and to manage Your account. We will contact You either through email, telephone,
postal mail or through the Service.
</p>
<p>
When it is necessary to do so, We will send You service-related announcements, primarily via
email. For example, if Our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, We may send You
an email. Generally, You may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional
in nature. If You do not wish to receive them, You have the option to deactivate Your
account by
<a href="/contact-us">contacting Us.</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Service Development; Customized Experience.
</strong>
We use information and content
that You and other Members provide to Us to conduct research and development for the
improvement of Our Services in order to provide You and other Members and Visitors with a
better, more intuitive experience and drive membership growth and engagement on Our Services
and to help connect individuals to relevant information and offers.
</p>
<p>
We also customize Your experience and the experiences of others on Our Services. For example,
when You sign in to Your account, We may display content relevant to Your geographic
location regarding health service providers in Your area. We may also, for example, try to
show You content, such as news and articles, that is relevant to You and Your specific
needs and concerns. We also may use Your information and content for invitations and
communications promoting Our Services or the Services of Our affiliates that are tailored to
You.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sharing Information with Affiliates.
</strong>
We may share Your personal information
with Our affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control
with CareDash) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You are consenting to this
sharing. We may combine information internally across different Services that We offer.
</p>
<h2>
Sharing with Third Party Service Providers
</h2>
<p>
Please understand that CareDash may contract with third parties to provide various services
to CareDash relating to CareDash on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services
Ourselves. This includes, but is not limited to, contracting with: (i) an email provider to
handle the distribution of email messages to Users of CareDash, (ii) a website hosting
provider to host CareDash for Us or (iii) a third party to provide call center services to
facilitate communication in connection with Our services. We may also contract with various
validation services to confirm contact information You provide. By using CareDash, all Users
consent to CareDash providing all information (whether or not personally identifiable)
received or collected from those Users to such third party providers for the purpose of
enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to Us. In addition,
all Users consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their information
(whether or not personally identifiable) by CareDash and these third party providers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Additional Sharing of Information with Third Parties.
</strong>
In addition to the sharing described above, We may disclose any of Your personal information
if We have a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably
necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to,
civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this
Privacy Policy or Our Terms of Use; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of
third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property,
or safety of CareDash, Our Services, Our Members, Visitors, or the public.
</p>
<p>
We may support middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to legal
and regulatory archiving requirements.
</p>
<p>
CareDash may establish subsidiaries or other related companies, or merge with or be acquired
by, or sell substantially all of its assets to another company. When that happens, We may
disclose to them Your personally identifiable information, in which case We will request
them to abide by this Policy. We may also disclose some personally identifiable information
to a potential acquirer.
</p>
<p>
Third parties (for example, Your email provider) may give You the option to upload certain
information in Your contacts stored with Us onto their own service. If You choose to share
Your contacts in this way, You will be granting Your third party provider the right to
store, access, disclose and use Your these contacts in the ways described in such third
party's terms and privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
We will share information provided by Users (whether or not personally identifiable) with
certain third parties in Our network so that they can contact You with information about the
services in which You have expressed interest. In order to provide the Services available to
You on this Site, We may also supplement Your information (whether or not personally
identifiable) with information from third party sources with whom We have contracted for the
purpose of verifying the contact information You have provided. You have the option not to
have Your information shared with third parties by not requesting these services.
</p>
<p>
We may also share information about Users (whether or not personally identifiable) with third
parties so that We can offer You with a broader range of services and information to meet
Your needs. If You would prefer not to have Your information shared with third parties, You
may opt out by
<a href="/contact-us">contacting Us.</a>
</p>
<h2>
Consent to Telemarketing Calls
</h2>
<p>
Further, by registering on this Site, You agree that this act constitutes an inquiry and/or
application for purposes of telemarketing laws, and notwithstanding that Your telephone
and/or cell number may be listed with the federal Do-Not-Call Registry, You expressly opt-in
to: (a) receive an offer or service from one or more of Our partners or affiliates; (b)
receive future information about products and Services from Us, Our partners, affiliates and
other third parties to whom We may provide Your information; (c) permit Us, Our partners,
affiliates and other third parties to contact You pursuant to the business relationship We
have established using the information You provided to Us for any purpose such as contacting
You by email address, phone and/or mobile phone number (including use of automated dialing
equipment), text (SMS) message or any means of communication for any purpose that, among
other things, Your wireless device may be capable of receiving (e.g. mms, video etc.). You
may revoke authorization for Us to contact You by such means at any time (see the Opting Out
section below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surveys &amp; Contests.
</strong>
From time-to-time CareDash will request personally
identifiable information from Users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys
or contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to
disclose personally identifiable information. The requested information typically includes
contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic and location
information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest or
survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of CareDash. Users' personally
identifiable information collected through surveys or contests is not shared with third
parties who are not agents or service providers, unless We give prior notice and receive
Your permission for the sharing. Though We may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys
or contests, these intermediaries will not use the Users' personally identifiable
information for any secondary purposes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Polls and Surveys.
</strong>
Polls and surveys may be conducted by Us, Members, or
third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to You on the results page based
on Your answers in the poll. We or third parties may follow up with You via email or
messages delivered through Our Service. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to
You to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires Your contact
information, You may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling
the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and
verifying Your contact information. It is up to You whether You provide this information, or
whether You desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personal
information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by
the party conducting it. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing Your
settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Search.
</strong>
You can search for healthcare providers and other health services on the CareDash website
and the CareDash mobile app.
You may also search for information about practices and hospitals in Your area, among other topics.
We may use personal information from Our Services, to inform and refine Our search service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Testimonials and Advertisements Placed Through CareDash Ads.
</strong>
If You provide
any testimonials about Our goods or Services or place advertisements through the CareDash
Ads, We may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements You place in connection
with Our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may
include Your name and other personal information that You have provided.
</p>
<h2>
Your Choices and Obligations
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
Controlling Your Personal Data.
</strong>
You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete Your personal information
controlled by CareDash regarding Your account, and (2) change or remove Your account content.
</p>
<p>
Please note: While healthcare providers can edit and remove Additional Healthcare Provider
Information, they cannot remove their provider, practice, and hospital Profiles, ratings, or reviews.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Account Termination.&nbsp;
</strong>
You can close your account by
<a href="/contact-us">contacting Us.</a>

accessible to You (for example, Your IP access logs) through CareDash’s customer service.
If you close Your account(s), information You have shared with others (for example,
physician reviews, comments on articles) or that others have copied may remain visible,
but Your information will generally be promptly removed from the Service. In addition,
You may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about You that other
Members copied or exported out of Our Services, because this information may not be in Our control.
</p>
<p>
Please note: healthcare providers cannot remove their provider, practice or hospital Profiles,
ratings, or reviews by closing their accounts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Data Retention.
</strong>
We retain the personal information You provide while Your
account is in existence or as needed to provide You services. We may retain Your personal
information even after You have closed Your account if retention is reasonably necessary to
comply with Our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent
fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and Our User Agreement. We may retain
personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Our
Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide
support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but We generally delete or de-personalize
closed account data consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Opting Out; Access to Collected Information.
</strong>
This Policy describes
CareDash’s uses of Your information. If You do not agree to Our uses of Your personally
identifiable information as We have described in this Policy, You are not required to
provide that information to Us. In addition, if We send emails to You, You may opt out of
receiving non-administrative emails from Us simply by responding to the opt-out link

<h2>
Important Information
</h2>
<p>
<strong>
Minimum Age.
</strong>
As described in the Terms of Use, persons must be of Minimum Age to use CareDash.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
CareDash Policy Regarding Children Under the Age of 18.
</strong>
CareDash complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA requires
that website operators never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
anyone under the age of 18 without prior verifiable parental consent. The Site is not
intended for children under the age of 18, and CareDash does not knowingly collect or use
personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18. If We discover
personal data from a child under the age of 18, We will eliminate that data.
</p><p>
You are not permitted to use CareDash if You are under the age of 18. By using CareDash, You
agree to provide Us with accurate information concerning Your age or identity if We request
it. You also agree not to assist children under the age of 18 in accessing CareDash or to
attempt to contact children under 18 through CareDash.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<strong>
California’s Shine the Light Law.
</strong>
California Civil Code Section 1798.83,
known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits Our customers who are California residents to
request and obtain from Us a list of what personal information (if any) We disclosed to
third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and
addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of
charge. Under Section 1798.83, We currently do not share any personal information with third
parties for their direct marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Security.
</strong>
CareDash will take reasonable measures to secure the personally
identifiable information Users provide to Us. However, CareDash cannot guaranty the security
of any information You submit to Us and You do so at Your own risk. All personally
identifiable information is protected by password and accessible only to authorized CareDash
personnel. However, there is a possibility that Internet transmissions containing a User's
personally identifiable information may be intercepted by others. There is no way for Us to
ensure the privacy of User information before it arrives at CareDash or after it leaves
CareDash.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Changes to Policy.
</strong>
If We make material changes to this Policy, We will notify you by email or by posting
a notice on the home page regarding the amended Policy, so that You are aware of what
personally identifiable information We collect, how We use it, and under what circumstances,
if any, We disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please
review CareDash frequently for any changes. Amendments to this Policy will be posted on
CareDash and will be effective when posted. You will be deemed to have been made aware of,
will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the changes to any amended or
revised Policy by Your continued use of Our services or CareDash.
