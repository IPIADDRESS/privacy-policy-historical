    <h1 class="blueBack blueTop">CarGurus.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><b>CarGurus</b> has provided this privacy policy because
we value your right to privacy. This policy is effective as of September 26,
2006 and governs the collection of personal information through this website on
or after this date. </p>

<p>This policy describes the types of information <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span>
collects from its users and how that information is used. Please read this
policy carefully before providing us with any personal information. If you have
questions about this policy, e-mail us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@CarGurus.com">privacy@CarGurus.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Information we collect.</h3>

<h4>1. Unregistered users</h4>

<p>We encourage you to register with us in order to take advantage of <span class="SpellE">CarGurus's</span> many personalization features. However, you may
choose not to register and take advantage of any feature of our site where
registration is not required.</p>

<p>If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited.
We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server,
administer our Web site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary
each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access our
site through an always-on type of Internet connection (e.g., cable modem or
DSL), or through a dial-up connection (e.g., AOL or <span class="SpellE">Earthlink</span>).
Either way, it would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your
IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If you reached our site by
clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that
information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand
the interests of our users. All of this information is collected and used only
in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it
to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual
visitors.</p>

<p>We also place a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer's
hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path
through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before.
However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable
information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read
data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies
created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand
how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse
to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web
browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts
strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well.
Since cookies don't provide us with any information from which we can identify
you, we suggest you allow us to place one on your computer.</p>

<p>If you visit our site by "clicking-through" from a site operated
by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner, then certain
information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted
to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you
reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how
you agreed that our partner could use that information. Regardless of what
information was transmitted to us, however, we don't keep it unless you
register with us.</p>

<h4>2. Registered users</h4>

<p>If you choose to register with us, you'll be able to add content to our
site. For example, you may post your own car reviews and participate in our
discussion forums. In addition, you will benefit from the ability to
personalize your <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span> site experience. The
benefits of registering will increase over time as we get to know you better
and introduce new features. We encourage you to register so that you can
experience everything that <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span> has to offer!</p>

<p>If you register with us, we will collect personal information from you in
addition to the non-personal information described above. That personal
information may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone
number, user name and password. The information we collect may vary, but we
only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms. We may
store all or some of that information in a cookie <span class="GramE">file</span>
on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit
our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and
present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our
site every time you visit. To improve services and enhance personalization, we
may periodically obtain information about you from other independent
third-party sources and add it to your registration information. Additionally,
authorized <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span> personnel may update your
registration information to accurately reflect any new information included in
communications received from you.</p>

<p>If you visit our site by "clicking-through" from a site operated
by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner, then certain
information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted
to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you
reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how
you agreed that our partner could use that information. We may or may not
retain that information; if we do, then we will only use it in accordance with
our privacy policy, regardless of the policy of the partner site from which you
came to us.</p>

<p>If you reach our site through one of our partners (whether or not you have
registered with our partner), and you choose to register with us, we may be
required to give our partner some or all of your registration information. We
will only do so in accordance with this policy, but we cannot control how our
partner uses the information. If you have questions about our partner's privacy
policy, you should review their policy before providing information to us. Of
course, you can ensure that the personal information you provide to us is not
shared with our partners (except in accordance with this policy), by visiting
us directly instead of clicking-through from one of our partners.</p>


<h4>3. Trusted Fulfillment Partners</h4>
<p>
When you request services beyond those directly available from us, we may 
provide your personal information to selected trusted fulfillment partners, 
such as automobile dealers or banks, who we believe can may be able to provide 
the product or service you request. For example, should you request a price quote 
for a new car, your personal information will be distributed to trusted automotive dealers.
</p>
<p>
Our trusted fulfillment partners may use your personal information to process your 
order, respond to your requests for information or provide further information about 
products and services that they believe will meet your continuing needs.  As our 
trusted fulfillment partners may keep and use your information whether or not you 
purchase their products or use their services, your personal information will be subject 
to their privacy policies, and you should contact them directly for more information about 
their specific privacy and opt-out policies.  By submitting a request for such services 
to us, you consent to our transmission of your personal information to those of our 
fulfillment partners that we, in our sole discretion, believe may be able to 
provide such services.
</p>

<h3>How we use the personal information we collect.</h3>

<p>We use the personal information we collect to help both of us! As we
mentioned above, registering with us allows you to personalize our Web site so
that it is most useful to you. It also allows you to log into our site
automatically each time you visit, rather than manually typing your user name
and password every time. We may also use this information to periodically
contact you with news or important information from <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span>
or to request your feedback on our site. In addition to these periodic updates,
we may email you additional materials, but only if you specifically request
them. These might include opt-in newsletters and other materials that you
proactively request from <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span>.</p>

<p>In addition to these communications, if you have provided an email address,
we may use your personal information to send you notifications about special
offers or to tell you about opportunities available from our partners. You may
opt-out of any or all marketing communications from <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span>
in any commercial e-mail we send or at any time, as well as access and update
your personal information, by visiting <a href="/Cars/user/myGarage.action" target="_blank">http://www.CarGurus.com/MemberProfile</a>.</p>

<p>We may also use certain information that you provide in order to present you
with advertising that you may find interesting. This benefits both of us. It
benefits us because advertising helps pay the bills, and we can charge our
advertisers more if they know that their ads will be seen by somebody more
likely to find it useful. It benefits you because you see advertising that may
actually be interesting to you, rather than annoying.</p>

<p>You can cancel your registration with us by e-mailing 
<a href="mailto:cancel@cargurus.com">cancel@CarGurus.com</a>, and
placing your email address in the subject of the e-mail. We will send you an
e-mail to confirm your request. After we receive confirmation, we will remove
your information from our active database, but some information may remain in
our archives. We may not be able to remove your information from our partners'
databases, if we have transmitted any information to them.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of your personal information.</h3>

<p>CarGurus does not sell or rent any personal
information to any third party, other than our partners, as discussed in this
policy. We may aggregate personal information from all of our users and provide
that information in the aggregate to other parties, including advertisers, for
marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do so, that information will
not be in a form that will allow any third party to identify you personally.</p>

<p>We may share your personal information with third-parties specifically engaged
by <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span> to provide services to <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span> (such as market research firms, marketing services
providers and advertising agencies), in which case we will require those
parties to agree to use any such personally-identifiable data solely for the
purpose of providing the specified services to <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span>.
As you might expect, <span class="SpellE">CarGurus</span> must cooperate with
legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose
personally identifiable information in response to requests from law enforcement
authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We don't
expect this to happen, but if it does, we will provide only the information
required. In other words, we will not simply turn over our database in response
to a specific legal requirement. We can also turn over information about you if
we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting
this policy, you consent to our doing so, in our sole discretion. You also
consent to our disclosing information about you in the course of legal
proceedings if we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably believe that
doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us in enforcing
our legal rights. We also may share your information in connection with a
corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset
sale, and in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Your profile on CarGurus will be publicly viewable and identifiable via your
screen name. CarGurus will not share your email address with any other members
nor display it any public manner. If you choose to participate in our member-to-member
communications programs, you may be contacted by other CarGurus members, using
CarGurus as an intermediary. All CarGurus members will have the option to turn
off the member-to-member communication features at any time.</p>

<h3>How you can review and update your personal information.</h3>

<p>You can review and update the personal information you have provided through
the registration process by visiting <a href="http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/user/myGarage.action" target="_blank">http://www.CarGurus.com/MemberProfile</a>.</p>

<h3>Steps we take to protect your personal information.</h3>

<p>CarGurus has implemented security procedures to
help protect the personal information stored in our systems. For example, we
limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe
reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ
processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session
termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal
information. But please know that there is no way for us to guarantee the
security of your personal information.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>This website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect
information about children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send
personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond
directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent
before receiving his or her personal information.</p>

<h3><span class="GramE">Changes to this Privacy Policy.</span></h3>

<p>We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do
so. If we make material changes that will affect personal information we have
already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of
the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your
registration.</p>
