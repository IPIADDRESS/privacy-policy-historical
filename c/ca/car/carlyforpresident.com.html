                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                
                <p>This document describes the privacy practices of Carly for President (the "Privacy Policy").</p>  

<p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you, including information gathered when you visit the campaign's website located at CarlyForPresident.com, the campaign's social media pages, the campaign's mobile site or downloadable mobile applications (collectively, the "Site"), and information we may receive from third parties or affiliates, how we may use that information, whether we disclose that information to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.  We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to our website.</p>  

<p>By using the Site, you consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> 

<p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's 
Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). COPPA and its accompanying FTC 
regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the 
Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. 
Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have 
designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 
whenever age-related information is requested.</p> 

<p>We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally 
identifiable information.  Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or 
can be used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information").  We also may 
collect information that by itself typically cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as 
demographic information (e.g., age, profession or gender), IP addresses, browser types, 
domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Site ("Non-
Personally Identifiable Information"). </p> 

<p>When you make a contribution through our Site, any credit card information provided is only 
used to immediately process your donation. We do not retain your credit card information once 
the donation is processed. Carly for President has adopted security measures to protect your 
financial information. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and 
receiving financial data from our site.</p> 

<p>We use log files and Google Analytics to assess the aggregate level of traffic on 
CarlyForPresident.com, including what pages people are visiting, and to diagnose any potential 
problems with the Site. This log file contains an IP address that gives us insight on the general 
geographic area of visitors but not information on a specific individual. We do not use log files to 
track a particular individual's use of our site. Google Analytics will place cookies on your 
computer that will generate information that we select about your use of the Site, including your 
computer's IP address.  That information will be transmitted to and stored by Google.  Google 
may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such 
third parties process the information on Google's behalf.  You may refuse the use of cookies by 
selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.  Please note that by doing so, you may not 
be able to use the full functionality of the Site.  The use of cookies by Google Analytics is 
covered by Google's privacy policy. All users remain anonymous unless they choose to give us 
personally identifiable information.</p> 

<p>Our site contains opportunities for a visitor to share content, and messages to friends and 
family. Some features of our site may allow you to store addresses for easy retrieval and reuse 
at a later time. This information is stored for your convenience. We use cookies to personalize 
and customize your interaction on our site, and to provide you with the best possible online 
experience.</p> 

<p>This site may include very small files provided by one or more online advertising networks that help them more precisely to target advertising to users, based on users' activity on sites within those networks. These files do not access or use information by which users can be personally 
identified. If you wish, you can prevent these files from using non-personal information about 
you by either deleting the cookie folder in your browser or by putting your browser's Privacy 
setting higher, but doing so will mean that you will not be presented with advertising that reflects 
the way that you use our, and other, websites -- and may well adversely affect your experience 
of websites that use cookies to enhance or personalize that experience. For more information 
about digital advertising, or to opt out of targeted ads, visit: https://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p> 

<p>Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include your name, email addresses, postal 
addresses, ZIP code, telephone number, credit card information, date of birth, gender, age, user 
name and password, and other information either desirable or necessary to provide quality 
services to our customers and visitors. </p> 

<p>To the extent we are able to do so, we may link your Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
with your Personally Identifiable Information.  We may also link information collected online with 
information we collect offline or that is collected online by third parties.  </p> 

<p>Carly for President may provide or sell your email address or other personal information to third 
parties for fundraising or other purposes.  Additionally, we may share your personal information 
with select third parties who offer goods or services we think may be of interest to you.  From 
time to time, we may partner with other organizations or companies to provide co-sponsored or 
co-branded promotions, services or events and may share your personal information with our 
co-sponsor(s) and partners.  Additionally, Carly for President may provide your personal 
information to service providers or contractors to perform functions on its behalf, such as, but 
not limited to, companies or individuals hired to communicate news, deliver our promotional 
materials via e-mail and direct mail, promote our social media presence and activities, to 
process credit card payments and to assist us with sending communications and performing 
other marketing and support functions. Also, we may use third-party social media platforms, 
including third-party social media websites, to communicate with you.</p> 

<p>We also may share with third parties aggregated demographic and statistical information that is 
not personally identifiable.</p> 

<p>Carly for President also may disclose an individual's personal information:<br>

</p><ul>
<li>to a person who in our reasonable judgment is seeking the information as an agent of the individual; </li>
<li>in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire;</li> 
<li>to a third party or parties, where disclosure is required or permitted by law; and</li>
<li>if, in our reasonable judgment, it is necessary enforce compliance with our internal policies or the Terms of Use or to protect our Site, supporters, or others.</li>
</ul><p></p> 

<p>We may be required to use or disclose your information in connection with a legal action or 
other proceeding, including without limitation, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We 
also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.</p> 

<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Carly for President.  This Privacy 
Policy does not apply to other websites that are accessible through this Site, including but not 
limited to any third-party websites that process payments on our behalf.  Please be aware that 
third-party websites that process payments for Carly for President and websites for our 
advertisers, sponsors, affiliated entities and other third parties that are accessible through this 
Site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  We are not 
responsible for the privacy practices of such sites and will not be responsible for any actions or 
policies of such third parties.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site 
and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit. </p> 

<p>By submitting your email address to our campaign on our Site, you agree to receive emails from 
our campaign; you may unsubscribe at any time. Should you wish to opt-out of receiving emails 
from Carly for President, an unsubscribe link is included in every e-mail. If the link is not working 
properly, or if you wish to communicate your desire to opt-out, please reply to the email with 
"Unsubscribe" in the subject line.</p> 

<p>Our site contains links to other websites and servers. The campaign does not bear responsibility 
for content on linked websites. Accordingly, you also agree that Carly for President will not be 
responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be 
caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, services on or through 
any such site or resource or goods. Carly for President provides links to original articles written 
and maintained by third parties. These links are provided as a convenience and do not imply a 
claim of ownership of that content.</p> 

<p>We are committed to protecting the security of any personal information you provide to us.  We 
maintain commercially reasonable safeguards to maintain the security and privacy of personal 
information that you provide to us.  After you have submitted your information online to us, we recommend that you end your browser session before leaving your computer.  In spite of these protections, we cannot guarantee the security of any data submitted over the Internet.  After your information reaches us, however, it is stored on servers (or in the case of information received from you in person, in writing or over the phone, in physical storage areas) protected by procedures and technology designed to block reasonably foreseeable intrusions by unauthorized third parties. </p> 

<p>Your browser and other mechanisms may permit you to send do-not-track signals or other 
similar signals to express your preferences regarding online tracking.  To the extent you employ 
such browser do-not-track signals or other similar mechanisms, we will use commercially 
reasonable efforts to honor such requests received by us to the extent we have the capacity and resources to identify and process your request. Due to the potential for rapid and diverse developments of technology in this area, we cannot guarantee that we can process every type of request that exists or may be developed in the future.  As noted above, third parties, such as our advertising partners, may collect data that relates to you.  We cannot control third parties' responses to do-not-track signals or other such mechanisms.  Third parties' use of data relating to you and responsiveness to do-not-track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies. </p> 

<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to request information from us regarding the 
manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties for their 
direct marketing purposes, in addition to the rights set forth above.  Under California law, you

designated email address for these is cpp@carlyforpresident.com.</p> 

<p>If you are accessing the Site from outside of the United States, you consent to the transfer of 
your information to the United States, and the processing, use, and sharing of your information 
in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Regardless of where your information is collected or 
transferred, the information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
