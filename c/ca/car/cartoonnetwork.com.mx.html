          <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2020</p> <p>To review our current Privacy Policy, please go to: <a href="https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/2019-privacy-terms.html">https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/2019-privacy-terms.html</a></p> <p>This Privacy Policy is about how Warner Bros. will collect and use any information you give us when you use our Services.&nbsp; The word “Services” in this Privacy Policy means our websites, mobile apps, games, and other online services.</p> <p>If you need help understanding this document, you should ask the adult who looks after you to read it and talk with you about it. Some of our websites and mobile apps are for adults as well as children. If you are an adult, you should take a look at our general audience <a href="http://www.warnerbros.com/privacy-center-wb-privacy-policy">Warner Bros. Privacy Policy</a> &nbsp;[https://policies.warnerbros.com/privacy/] for more information about how we will collect and use your data, including on Services that link to this policy.</p> <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Information about you</strong></p> <p>For some of our Services, you don’t need to give us information like your name or email address to use the Service.&nbsp;</p> <p>For some of our Services, we will ask for some more information from you so you can use the Service. We might need to ask permission from the adult who looks after you before you can give us this information.&nbsp; This can include things like:</p> <p>- your first name<br> -&nbsp;your location<br> -&nbsp;your email address<br> - your username<br> -&nbsp;your telephone number<br> -&nbsp;your home address<br> - numbers that identify your account or device<br> -&nbsp;a photo or video of you</p> <p>For some of our Services, such as virtual worlds, you can play games, talk with your friends or get items, such as gems and additional costumes or powers for your character. For these Services you need to choose a nickname or create an account. You will need to create a username and password and fill out other information about you. &nbsp;For some Services, we collect your email address to help you make an account and then we keep your email address only in a “hashed” format so that it doesn’t identify you.&nbsp; We use these “hashed” email addresses to help with your account, like to help you if you forget your password.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Information about your adult</strong></p> <p>Sometimes, we need to collect information about the adult who looks after you. For example, we do this so we can:</p> <p>- let them know about your interest in the Services<br> - ask them for permission so you can access parts of our Services<br> - tell them how to start some of the features for you</p> <p>When we need to contact the adult who looks after you, we will need to get some information from them, so we may ask for their:</p> <p>- full name<br> -&nbsp;address<br> - email address<br> -&nbsp;telephone number</p> <p><strong>When you buy things</strong></p> <p>Before buying something, you should always have permission from the adult who looks after you. When you buy something in a Service, your adult may have to pay for it with real money. Some of our Services allow you to buy things inside the Service, pay to join our clubs, and use online money from our Services.</p> <p><strong>When you talk with your friends</strong></p> <p>Some of our Services will let you talk with your friends in a way that shows your conversation with other people on the Service. Usually, you will choose from phrases we have already written. Otherwise, we will look at the messages so no one uses any bad words or shares your personal information. If we see that you are sharing your personal information with someone else, we will try to delete it before it is shared. We may ask permission from the adult who looks after you before we let you talk to your friends on our Services or if our Services let you post on social media.</p> <p><strong>Information about your computer, console or smartphone</strong></p> <p>When you visit or use one of our Services, we will get some information about your device and your internet browser (for example, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about your IP Address and how you use our Services. To learn more, see our section about Cookies.</p> <p><strong>Notifications</strong></p> <p>You can choose to receive notifications on your device or within the Service.&nbsp; Some of these notifications to your device are sent from outside your device (called push notifications). We may need to ask permission from the adult who looks after you to collect the information that we need to send you these push notifications. You can always turn notifications off in the settings of your device. This might be difficult, so make sure to ask the adult who looks after you to help.</p> <p><strong>When you contact us</strong></p> <p>If you contact us by email or using an online form, we will ask you for some information. For example, this may include your first name and email address. We will also ask you to tell us why you are contacting us. Once we have helped you, we will delete your information.</p> <p><strong>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p> <p>We use your information for different reasons.</p> <p><strong>Where we have a legitimate interest</strong></p> <p>When using your information is very important to us but still fair to you, we have something called a "legitimate interest". When we have a legitimate interest and we use your information, we need to be sure that it is not going to upset you. We will use your information for our legitimate interest only if the laws of your country allow this.&nbsp; In some countries, we may need to ask for your consent or the consent of the adult who looks after you before we can use your information in these ways.</p> <p>For example, we have a legitimate interest when we give you access:</p> <p>- to our Services<br> - to play games<br> - to chat with your friends<br> - to post or send us comments</p> <p>We also have a legitimate interest, so we can:&nbsp;</p> <p>- learn how to make our Services better<br> - make sure your experience can be special and personalized for you<br> - keep you and others safe&nbsp;<br> - answer your questions and comments when you contact us</p> <p><strong>If you and/or the adult who looks after you gives us permission (consent)&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>If you are old enough, you can give us permission to use your information. If you are not old enough, you will sometimes need to ask the adult who looks after you for permission. For example, when you want to receive a newsletter.</p> <p><strong>If the law says we must use your information</strong></p> <p>If the law says we must use your information, then we will do so. For example:&nbsp;</p> <p>- if the government or the police need to investigate something<br> - if the law says we need to use your information</p> <p><strong>HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p> <p><strong>Our helpers (service providers)</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we have helpers who make sure our Services are great. They will help operate the Services or help with buying things on our Services, like points. They will also help with sending prizes to competition winners. We make sure that our helpers keep your information safe.</p> <p><strong>Our friends (for example, co-sponsors)</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we ask our friends to help us with our Services. If we do, they will have access to your information. We will let you know when we ask our friends to help us.</p> <p><strong>Our family (affiliates)</strong></p> <p>Sometimes we may share information with members of our family that agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. You can find a list of some of the Warner Bros. Entertainment Group companies and affiliated WarnerMedia companies <a href="https://policies.warnerbros.com/privacy/en-us/affiliates">here</a> [https://policies.warnerbros.com/privacy/en-us/affiliates]. We may update this list from time-to-time, so please check back periodically to keep up-to-date.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Links to other people's websites (external links)</strong></p> <p>Our Services will sometimes have links to other people's websites. Those people can treat your information differently from us. You should make sure you understand how they will use your information by looking at their privacy policies.</p> <p><strong>Sharing information </strong></p> <p>When we have your adult’s permission for you to use social media platforms or plugins on our Services, those platforms can share their information back to the social media platform. This can mean that your friends will be told about what you do on our Service. You and the adult who looks after you should look at the privacy policies of these social media sites to learn more about how they use information about you.</p> <p><strong>If the law says we must share your information</strong></p> <p>Warner Bros., our friends and our helpers will sometimes need to share your information with other people when the law says so.
