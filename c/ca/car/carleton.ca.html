  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">II 	PRINCIPLES</font></p>
</b> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This policy is an adaptation 
  of the Province of Ontario's Freedom of Information legislation to Carleton 
  Universityâ€™s operations so that the University will meet the public policy objectives 
  of that legislation. The need for the adaptation is the product of the fact 
  that the organizational form and function of government, the context for the 
  design of the legislation, is fundamentally different from that of the University 
  but the principles underlying the adaptation are the same. These principles 
  are basically three in number. They are:</font></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A democratic society 
      requires an informed population and to achieve that condition information 
      about what the government and the public institutions are doing and plan 
      to do, needs to be known.</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To achieve that end 
      a broad access to information about the government and the public institutions 
      needs to be created for the public. This broad access needs to be balanced 
      by certain operational requirements of privacy, confidentiality and legal 
      privilege.</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To arbitrate conflicts 
      between the requirements of broad access and these operational requirements 
      of privacy, confidentiality, and legal privilege needs an independent referee 
      and so independent commissioners are appointed to perform this function.</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the University is 
  not a government agency and neither its structure nor its function mirrors the 
  function or structure of government, it is an institution which is tax-supported 
  and performs a public function. It has been the wish of successive governments 
  that the Universities in this province adopt policies akin to the legislation 
  so that information about the operations of the Universities will be known to 
  their several communities.</font></p>

          achieve a condition of broad access to administrative information of 
          the University some changes to practices and procedures of the University 
          are needed. The first of these is the establishment of a uniform system 
          for the management of this information in an organization which is highly 
          decentralized and where each unit has its own filing system and method 
          of keeping records. To make access to information practicable there 
          will be a need for some uniformity of record management and to this 
          end units will have to adjust their systems over time to fit within 
          these rules.</font></p>

          due to changing records retention policies. Because the University is 
          in the process of setting up an archives there is a large number of 
          records, documents and files which are no longer in the custody of the 
          originating departments but held in some form of storage with a minimum 
          of cataloguing. All reasonable attempts will be made to retrieve such 
          documents, records or files if asked to do so but the University reserves 
          the right to refuse access to such records, documents or files if the 
          amount of time required to locate them, edit them for privileged, private 
          or confidential information and reproduce them is excessive in terms 
          of the available resources. Any decision to deny access to information 
          in storage will be made by the University Officer and is subject to 
          the complaint procedure described in these regulations.</font></p>
