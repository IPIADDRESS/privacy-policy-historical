<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Your ("You" or "Your") privacy concerns are important to Nterface Apps LLC, ("Us", "We" or "Our") and protecting Your privacy and safeguarding Your information is one of Our highest goals.

<p>Our Services are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Our Services attempt to block such users from providing personal information. We reserve the right to delete any information We believe to be in violation of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p>The information We collect enables Us to refine and offer better services to You. We may share the information We collect about You with Our affiliates. An affiliate is a company that We own, control or one that is under common control with Us or Our parent company.</p>

<h2>No Liability</h2>
<p>We have made significant investments in protecting and safeguarding Your information. We continuously upgrade and enhance Our security measures as new tools, techniques and technology become available. However, We do not guaranty that any such information will not be misused or disclosed to third parties. We will not have any liability to You for any such misuse or disclosure.
