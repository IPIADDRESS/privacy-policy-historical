        <li>
            Information supplied by visitors to the website when they:
            <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha"><li>Create a new account</li>
                <li>Login to their account</li>
                <li>List, modify, delete a car (for sale) ad</li>

                <li>Inquire about a vehicle listed for sale or about another product or service offered through our website</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Information we collect as visitors use our website.
            <p>You need to sign up to use certain products, services, and tools on our website that require you to provide information about yourself, such as your name, physical address, email address, and phone number. For example, you may provide such information if you sign up for a new account, newsletters, complete our "Feedback" form, or use a social media tool. We may use such information in order to provide you with the products, services, or tools you have requested.</p>
            <p>When you list a car for sale, we ask for information about the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers (including information like your phone number and email address).</p>
            <p>In addition to the above, we may collect information, and/or use the information we collect, in the following specific ways:</p>
            <p><strong>Searches and Listings</strong></p>
            <p>To make use of certain features on our website, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close to home, we need to know what kind of car you are looking for and your location. We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search. We use this information to help you find the car you are looking for or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p><strong>Sweepstakes and Other Promotions</strong></p>
            <p>From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our website. If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional contest, we will ask you to provide information about yourself (such as your name, phone number, address, date of birth, and email address). Among other things, we will use this information to contact you if you win, and we may also use this information for marketing purposes. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes; we will identify the co-sponsor in the contest rules. We may also share this information with shipping or fulfilment companies or other third-party service providers that help administer our promotions, such as by conducting drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners. If you do not want us to collect the information requested in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.</p>
            <p><strong>Online Surveys</strong></p>
            <p>From time to time, we survey our users to measure their satisfaction with our website and other sites and to help us learn more about our audience and how they interact with our website. Third-party research firms often conduct these surveys on our behalf. We use the survey results to help us improve the services we offer to you. We will take the information you provide and aggregate it on an anonymous basis with data collected from other survey participants. We may use and disclose that pool of anonymous information as we see fit, without identifying you personally.</p>
            <p>You may also find on our website invitations to participate in surveys conducted by our advertisers, whose privacy practices we do not control. These invitations will usually link to an online survey form that is hosted either by the advertiser conducting the survey or by a third-party research firm working on the advertiser's behalf. When you access an advertiser's survey through our website, the use and disclosure of any information you submit will be governed by the advertiser's privacy policy (or by the privacy policy of the advertiser's research firm), which may differ from ours. If you cannot find the applicable privacy policy via a link either from the advertiser's survey invitation or from the online survey form, you should contact the advertiser directly for more information.</p>
            <p><strong>Email Addresses</strong></p>
            <p>We may use your email address to respond to requests you make for our products or services or to respond to your communications with us. We may also contact you to inquire about your experience on our website, to provide you with information about our products and services available from us or from our affiliates, or to communicate to you information related to the automotive industry. From time to time, we may also send you emails that include special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you. We hope you will find these communications informative and useful. If you do not, you can unsubscribe from any of our commercial email programs by following the simple instructions included in an email you receive in connection with that program.</p>
            <p>If you request for a car using our Latest Car Requests, we will use and share your email address and other contact information with participating dealers as described earlier.</p>
            <p><strong>My Account</strong></p>
            <p>Creating and logging in to your account helps you find the right car by allowing you to do things, like saving your favourite searches and cars, viewing car requests, and searching for potential buyers. It also lets you customize your profile picture, edit first name, last name, phone number, address, post code etc.</p>
            <p>To access your account, we will ask you to register with us on the form provided, which may include personally identifiable information like your email address. You may also be asked to provide additional optional personal information, such as your name, gender, and age. You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. We use this information to process your registration request, provide you with the services and communications that you request, customize features that appear on our website, measure traffic on our website, and improve our website and the services and features offered to users. We may share information we collect while you are using the Site, including registration information, with our affiliates and with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in providing services.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Networks</strong></p>
            <p>When you use one of the social network sharing tools available on our website, we and the social network operating the tool may collect information about you based on such use. The social network's use of that information will be subject to its own privacy policy, which may be different from this Privacy Statement.</p>
            <p><strong>Content You Post to our Website</strong></p>
            <p>If you choose to post content to any of the interactive areas of our website, such as discussion forums, comments fields, and social media areas, please keep in mind that the information you post can be seen, collected, and used by anyone who has access to those areas. You may also have the opportunity from time to time to respond to questions that we display to users of the website.
