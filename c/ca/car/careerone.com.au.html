We may also aggregate data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search. This aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or fellow job seekers or community members. If we create a co-branded site with another company, information will be retained by both companies and subject to the privacy policies of both companies which will be published on the co-branded sites.</li><p></p><li>We disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith – after considering your privacy interests and other factors – that such action is necessary to: (a) meet legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. <br>     &nbsp;</li><li>We may disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires any or all of CareerOne’s business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event CareerOne becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, such information will be disposed of in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the site.</li></ol><h2>An Important Note about Your CV</h2><p>When you create or post a CV, we store it in our searchable CV database. Visible and limited CVs can be found by anyone with access to our CV database. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of CVs that have been viewed or downloaded by others.<strong><br> </strong></p><p><strong>We attempt to limit access to our searchable CV database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters human resource professionals and, career development specialists but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. </strong>We cannot control the use made of CVs by third parties who access the CV database. Once your CV has been disclosed, CareerOne is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it.</p><p>You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However anyone who viewed your CV may have kept a copy of it in their own files or databases. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your CV.</p><p>CVs you give to us must not contain sensitive data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or biometric details or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, (viii) the commission of any unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties, or (ix) any Social Security Number or national identification number. If your CV does contain this information, then you agree that it is at your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information from our searchable database.</p><h2>How We Store Information</h2><p>Because managing your career is a life-long process, we retain all the information we gather about you in an effort to make repeat use of our sites more efficient, practical and relevant until you change or remove your personal data as described below. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your profile or CV at any time. Log into your account, go to your profile or CV, and make the desired changes.</p><p>Access to or correction, update, or deletion of your personal information may be denied or limited by CareerOne if it would violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you wish to delete or close your account or account profile information altogether, please contact us. We will send you an email to confirm that your personal information has been deleted (save for an archival copy which is not accessible by you or third parties on the Internet). The archival copy is retained only for as long as needed for audit and record purposes. We will also keep logs and information that may relate to your activity on the site.</p><p>We will respond to information access requests without undue delay of receipt and in any event within 30 days. If we require additional time to provide access to your information, we will acknowledge receipt of your request within 30 days and promptly supplement our response within the time period required by applicable law.</p><p>Separately, and regardless of your CV privacy setting, if you do not log into your account for a significant period of time, it will expire and be scheduled for deletion. Expired accounts are deleted on a periodic basis. Our current expiration period is approximately 36 months; we may extend or reduce this period in order to adjust to changing hiring patterns. If we change the period, we will update this notice. You will always receive an email from us before we delete your CV in this manner.</p><h2>Security</h2><p><strong>You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret.</strong></p><p>CareerOne takes appropriate measures to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You can find additional information on conducting a safe job search in our Security Centre. You should be aware that CVs may be monitored by your current employer.</p><p>When you place an order online at CareerOne, your credit card information is encrypted with industry standard encryption. This makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. CareerOne uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.

We use cookies to:</p><ul style="padding-left: 20px"><li>Security: These cookies allow us to secure access to your account.</li><li>Preference: These cookies are used to store your preferences like language choice and display of job search results.</li><li>Analytics: We track traffic patterns so we can identify popular content and potential problems. Features: We track which jobs you search for, view, and apply to so we can show you more jobs like those. We also use cookies to split some users into test groups to test new features.</li><li>Advertising: We use non-identifiable information about you to show you advertising.</li></ul><p></p><p>A cookie is a text file that is either stored in your computer’s memory temporarily (a “session” cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a “persistent” cookie) by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p><p>When you return to the CareerOne site, cookies enable us to retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the features that you customised. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalised site experience. For example, if you personalise CareerOne pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences).</p><p>We predominately use “session” cookies, which are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out a job search or apply online a large amount of data is processed by our system and transferred through each page of the search or application process. This information includes your job search criteria, data that identifies your CV, covering letter, the job you are applying for, your right to work in the relevant country and the results of any questionnaire you have completed as part of the online application process as well as demographic information that is not unique to you. “Session” cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or application. We also use cookies to identify users who have been banned from using our forums for behaviour that contradicts our terms of use and to track click streams, for load balancing and to enable you to navigate through the site using redirection pages.</p><p>We use “persistent” cookies primarily to ensure that we do not show you pages that you have already seen and to personalise your site experience and save you time. “Persistent” Cookies enable us to recognise whether you have responded to any poll or seen an advertisement or information notice placed on the site so that we do not show you the poll, advertisement or notice again the next time you visit our site. If you are a recruiter and have an alliance arrangement in place with CareerOne we also use “persistent” cookies to recall your alliance status and display your correct pricing information when you access our site. The “persistent” cookies we use will remain on your computer after you have left our site and will expire when you log out of the Sites or 60 days after your last visit for security cookies, 90 days after your last visit for poll response and alliance cookies, or two years after your last visit for advertisement and information notice cookies.</p><p>We also allow other companies to display advertisements to you while you are visiting our Sites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the other companies’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. CareerOne has no control over, and is not responsible for, the practices of those third party advertisers. CareerOne encourages you to review the policies of such advertisers. (You will find additional information about the following third party ad servers at Double Click and Atlas Solutions. We use other third party ad servers as well; a way to opt out of third party cookies is to modify your browser settings to decline cookies as described at the end of this statement.)</p><p><b>Collecting data for retargeting and targeted multi-site advertising:</b> CareerOne does partner with third parties to collect and define information about visitors to our website/s.
