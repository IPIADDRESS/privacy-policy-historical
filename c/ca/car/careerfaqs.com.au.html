<h2>SSL Security and Data Encryption</h2><br>

At Career FAQs we take the security of our customers' personal details very seriously. We use proven technology to ensure the highest level of protection. Any information that you send to us is encoded with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) using 128 bit encryption technology. This is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure e-commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including your credit card number, name and address, as it travels from your computer to ours, and from our computer to the bank. Interception by an unauthorised party is impracticable, as long as your browser and local network support the use of encrypted data transmissions.<br><br>

<h2>Credit Card Information</h2><br>

Your credit card details are not captured or stored on our system. Once they have†been encrypted they go straight to the bank. And when you receive your order confirmation for your record, we only list the last 6 digits of your credit card number.<br><br>

<h2>Currency</h2><br>

All prices quoted on the Career FAQS website are quoted in Australian Dollars (AUD). This is the only currency used on this website.<br><br>

<h2>For further information </h2><br>

Please contact us to ask for access to your information or if you have a complaint concerning your information privacy or if you would like more information about our approach to privacy. <br><br>

If you require more information about Australia's Privacy Laws and the National Privacy Principles, you can access the Federal Privacy Commissioner's website at <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au">www.privacy.gov.au</a>. <br><br>

This Privacy Statement is current as at August 2005. Career FAQs may change or update the policy from time to time.		</div>		</td>
