				<b><font face="Arial">CartManager Online Shopping Cart Software Web Site Privacy Policy</font></b><br><br>
				<font face="Arial" size="2">CartManager ("CartManager", 
				"we", "our", "us") values your 
				privacy and endeavors to treat your personal information with 
				due care and security. Our Privacy Policy sets forth the ways in 
				which CartManager obtains and uses your personal information. 
				CartManager reserves the right, without notice, to modify or 
				eliminate all or a portion of this Privacy Policy at any time. 
				By making use of the CartManager website or any CartManager 
				product or service, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy 
				in its ongoing form.<br>
				<br>
				CartManager may collect information directly from you in order to 
				provide products or services, to administer customer service 
				assistance, or to fulfill any legal or regulatory requirements. 
				CartManager may also obtain personal information as a result of 
				a consumer's financial transactions using the CartManager 
				product(s) or through a merchant that uses the CartManager 
				products and/or services. With respect to any information a 
				CartManager merchant may provide, CartManager will treat the 
				information in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
				CartManager online Service Agreement, which may be viewed at: 
				<a href="http://www.cartmanager.net/administration/termsagreement.php3">http://www.cartmanager.net/administration/termsagreement.php3</a><br>
				<br>
				CartManager may store the information that you provide. This 
				information may include, for example, your name, mailing 
				address, e-mail address and telephone number, as well as certain 
				interactive data such as the type of browser you use, the files 
				you request, or the domain or IP address you use to access our 
				website(s). If you supply us with personal data or request 
				information from us, we may use your information to respond to 
				your request. If you are a CartManager merchant you may receive 
				third-party email notifications and/or offers relating to 
				products or services in which CartManager believes you may have 
				an interest. You can change the preference settings in your 
				CartManager account at any time.<br>
				<br>
				CartManager limits access to your personal information to those 
				CartManager employees and business clients that need the 
				information in order to provide our products and services to 
				you. If you are a CartManager merchant, we may share your 
				information with outside parties for such purposes as (by way of 
				example and not of limitation) obtaining credit reports, 
				performing customer verifications, and administering 
				underwriting and risk management functions. We will disclose 
				your information in response to a valid request issued by a 
				court, government agency or regulatory authority.<br>
				<br>
				When we have a direct customer relationship with you, we will 
				strive to make information available to you about the general 
				uses of the information we collect. Generally, we publish or 
				link to this information on web pages at the point of sale, 
				through privacy notices on our websites, and by other means 
				specified by applicable state and federal laws.<br>
				<br>
				When we obtain personal information as part of our direct 
				relationship with you, we will not share this information with 
				non-affiliated third parties, except in the following 
				circumstances:</font>
				<ul>
					<li><font face="Arial" size="2">In accordance with the 
						CartManager Privacy Policy</font>
					</li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">To facilitate and complete 
						merchant-initiated or authorized transactions</font>
					</li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">To comply with federal, state, 
						and local laws, including credit reporting laws and credit 
						card association rules</font>
					</li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">To investigate fraud</font>
					</li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">In the case of CartManager 
						merchants, to offer products and services that CartManager 
						believes may be of interest to you.</font></li>
				</ul>
				<font face="Arial" size="2">CartManager employs industry-standard 
				security measures to protect personal information collected 
				against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or 
				destruction. These measures may include, without limitation, 
				encryption, restricted internal access, physical access 
				security, and other technologies. CartManager continually reviews 
				and enhances its security systems in an ongoing effort to 
				provide safe and secure treatment of its data.<br>
				<br>
				As part of its products and services, CartManager may create 
				links to third-party websites. CartManager is not responsible for 
				the content or privacy practices employed by third-party 
				websites that are linked to our website, nor does CartManager 
				control or warrant the utility, merchantability, or workmanship 
				of the products or services offered at third-party websites. 
				Before you supply your personal information to a third-party 
				website, whether or not the third party is a merchant, client, 
				or partner of CartManager, you should review and understand the 
				applicable privacy policy for that website.<br>
				<br>
				The examples contained in this Privacy Policy are illustrations 
				only, and they are not intended to be all-inclusive. If your 
				CartManager account is terminated for any reason or if you become 
				an inactive customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply. 
				If you are a merchant using the CartManager product(s) or 
				service(s), this Privacy Policy applies to all accounts you may 
				have with us, and it replaces all our previous disclosures to 
				you about our information practices.<br>
				<br>
				If you have any questions about the CartManager Privacy Policy, 
				please contact us using one of the methods available on the 
				"Contact Us" page of the CartManager website.<br>
				<br>
The CartManager Privacy Policy applies only to persons or companies making use of the CartManager website, CartManager's shopping cart software, product(s), and/or services(s) in the United States of America. To the extent allowed by law, the same terms and conditions hereof apply to non-U.S. parties. However, additional terms and conditions under international laws and cross-border credit card association regulations may apply.<br>
