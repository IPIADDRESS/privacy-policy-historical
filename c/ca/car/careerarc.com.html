Employers and recruiters who have access to these databases, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to these databases may have retained a copy of your profile or resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes or other Personally Identifiable Information of Users by any of such parties while such resumes or Personally Identifiable Information are in resume books or any of our Networks.</li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site or use the Services. These companies may use information (not including your name, street address, email or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other web sites, or use of the Services, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">From time to time, we may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent or mitigate harm, or to investigate or report on activity which we believe to be unlawful. </li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;"> We may also disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by merger, restructuring, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets related to the Services.

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">All Users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or distribute Personally Identifiable Information (such as their e-mail address) to others (whether in chat rooms, message boards or discussion forums, by posting jobs, responding to employers message or otherwise), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not responsible.</li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">Finally, if you provide any information to parties who operate Third Party Web sites that are linked to or from the Site or Services, or if you input your information on a co-branded registration page such as that of CareerArc and a partner company in connection with a partnership, sponsorship or contest, different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information by such other party or in connection with such partnership, sponsorship or contest.

We gather and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Site or Services, identify Users when they visit the Site or use the Services, track Users' movements on the Site or through use of the Services, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We also may use the IP addresses to geo-target advertisements. We may share this information with our partners so that they too may understand our User base and Site and Service usage patterns, but only on a collective, aggregated basis and in a manner which does not reveal any personally identifiable information about any individual User.</li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">We may use spot light ads, cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.</li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">When you visit the Site, the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through the Site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. </li>

Cookies allow sites and advertisers to "remember" users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify Users, although they do identify a User's computer.

Opting out of tailored advertising will not prevent you from seeing ads altogether, and we cannot guarantee that these opt-out tools will always be effective; the opt-out tools are simply designed to ensure your ads will not be delivered through targeting methods from these online ad networks.

In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personally Identifiable Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personally Identifiable Information that were disclosed.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">As stated above, we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do ask us to share your Personally Identifiable Information with a third party for its direct marketing purposes, we will only share such information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, out of such use as specified in our "Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy". Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</li>

                            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:legal@careerarcgroup.com">legal@careerarcgroup.com</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</li>
