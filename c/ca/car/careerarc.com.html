These companies may use information (not including your name, street address, email or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other web sites, or use of the Services, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">From time to time, we may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent or mitigate harm, or to investigate or report on activity which we believe to be unlawful. </li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;"> We may also disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by merger, restructuring, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets related to the Services.

This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not responsible.</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">Finally, if you provide any information to parties who operate Third Party Web sites that are linked to or from the Site or Services, or if you input your information on a co-branded registration page such as that of CareerArc and a partner company in connection with a partnership, sponsorship or contest, different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information by such other party or in connection with such partnership, sponsorship or contest.

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">When you complete your profile to register on the Site or to use the Services, you will be presented with a series of choices regarding whether you want to receive certain types of communications directly from us or on behalf of our business partners and advertisers. If you do not wish to receive any or all of such communications, you may opt-out by responding "no" or clicking the appropriate box to opt-out. By electing not to opt-out of such communications, you are granting permission to allow CareerArc to send the selected communications. We reserve the right to send you communications regarding the Site or the Services, or to advise you of Site or Service changes or other events or occurrences which may affect your access to or use of the Site or Services (such as service announcements, administrative notices and the like) without offering you the opportunity to opt out of them. If after opting-in to our Networks or receiving communications from us or our business partners, you wish to opt-out of participation in the Network or from receiving future communications, you may do so at any time. To do so, simply log in to your applicable Network account, go to your profile, and you will find options for editing your opt-in preferences.</li>

        <br>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">We may collect IP addresses from all Users of the Sites or Services, and collect and monitor other data and information about the activities of our Users on the Site or Services collectively. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This data is not used to track or monitor personally identifiable information of individual Users. We gather and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Site or Services, identify Users when they visit the Site or use the Services, track Users' movements on the Site or through use of the Services, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We also may use the IP addresses to geo-target advertisements. We may share this information with our partners so that they too may understand our User base and Site and Service usage patterns, but only on a collective, aggregated basis and in a manner which does not reveal any personally identifiable information about any individual User.</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">We may use spot light ads, cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">When you visit the Site, the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through the Site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. </li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">Users may be directed to the Site or Services via banner ads or site links.

        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a User's hard drive, are employed by thousands of sites to enhance users' Web viewing the Site. Cookies allow sites and advertisers to "remember" users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify Users, although they do identify a User's computer. We use session and persistent cookies for remembering User preferences and current session information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">As you browse the Site, online ad networks we work with may place anonymous cookies on your computer, and use similar technologies, in order to understand your interests based on your (anonymous) online activities, and to tailor more relevant ads to you. If you do not wish to receive such tailored advertising, you may use the opt-out tool of the Network Advertising Initiative found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a> , or the opt-out tool of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> . Opting out of tailored advertising will not prevent you from seeing ads altogether, and we cannot guarantee that these opt-out tools will always be effective; the opt-out tools are simply designed to ensure your ads will not be delivered through targeting methods from these online ad networks. We and our online ad networks provide opt-out mechanisms through the tools linked above and do not currently respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.</li>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">A California resident who has provided Personally Identifiable Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personally Identifiable Information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom Personally Identifiable Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personally Identifiable Information that were disclosed.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">As stated above, we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do ask us to share your Personally Identifiable Information with a third party for its direct marketing purposes, we will only share such information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information for use in direct marketing by a third party, out of such use as specified in our "Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy". Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 15px;">California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:legal@careerarcgroup.com">legal@careerarcgroup.com</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</li>
