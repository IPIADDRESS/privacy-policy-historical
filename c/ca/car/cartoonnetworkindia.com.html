<p>Cartoon Network is fully committed to providing a fun, entertaining and safe web site for people of all ages. Because we want our audience to feel comfortable exploring the content offered on <u>CartoonNetworkIndia.com</u>, this Online Privacy Policy outlines and clarifies how we collect and use information online, our advertising policies and the safeguards we recommend to ensure a fun and safe web experience. As new technology and online standards evolve, we may modify these policies to better address your concerns. If you have any concerns or questions about this Online Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:parent.info@turner.com">parent.info@turner.com</a> or write to us at S-2 Level, Block F, International Trade Tower, Nehru Place, New Delhi 110019.

</p><p><b>Data Collection</b>
</p><p>At some of our sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, or subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities or otherwise voluntarily provide information to us. In connection with certain offline competitions and contests you may be invited to submit personal information. The types of information that may be collected offline or at various pages online include: your name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone/mobile number, your gender and date of birth. We request these details in order to provide the service or product to you (i.e. despatch prizes, send goodies via email, post, fax or phone).
</p><p>We may use the information you provide to send you details via email, post, fax, SMS or phone of our products and services and the products and services of third parties we think are suitable and may be of interest to you. By submitting your details, you are consenting to such use. However, you always have the opportunity to remove your consent to such use or to have your or your child's contact information removed from our database by sending an email to <a href="mailto:parent.info@turner.com">parent.info@turner.com</a> or writing to us at S-2 Level, Block F, International Trade Tower, Nehru Place, New Delhi 110019 with your request.
</p><p>We may on occasion combine information we receive online with other records to enhance our ability to notify you of our products and services that we think will be of interest to you.
</p><p>Where practical and possible, we will attempt to give notice via email to parents of children under the age of 13 when we collect information (email addresses or any other information) from their child. For visitors over 13 years of age, we may collect information, with your permission, that will be used to improve your experience on CartoonNetworkIndia.com (e.g., online surveys). You may ask us to disclose to you the personal information that we have collected from you and we may ask you to pay a small fee to cover the costs of copying and providing you with such information. On your request, we will amend any such information about you that you advise us is incorrect.

</p><p><b>Disclosure of Information</b>
</p><p>We may share information about visitors to this site in aggregate with third parties including advertisers, business partners, and sponsors, to understand customer trends and patterns and manage and improve our business relationships.
</p><p>We may share personal information with third parties to administer and process your requests (e.g., when you order a product or service we may share your details with third party financial institutions to process payment for your order). We may also share your details with third parties to obtain professional advice, to perform marketing, administration or other services on our behalf, to market or sell new services or products to you or to jointly promote services or products to you. Disclosure of your information to third parties will be subject to such third parties' privacy policies, which may be different from these privacy policy terms. By "opting-in" to our privacy policy you are consenting to such disclosure.
</p><p>Agents and contractors of ours who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing.
</p><p>We may disclose information we hold in response to legal proceedings, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

</p><p><b>Sweepstakes and Contests</b>
</p><p><u>CartoonNetworkIndia.com</u> strives to create imaginative online contests or promotions. We do this because, well, it's fun. However, before entering a Cartoon Network contest online, we require kids to ask a parent for permission. Children under 13 years of age are required to enter their parent's email address as well. This is done so that we may contact a parent via email to notify them that their child has entered a Cartoon Network contest and to give them the option of removing the child's email address from the list of entries. Cartoon Network will not use a parent's email address for any other purpose. Cartoon Network will remove a parent's or their child's details from our database within 72 hours of any request from that parent. Sometimes we may also require a visitor to provide us additional information that is not personally identifiable. For example, we might ask you to tell us your favourite character or answer a trivia question. In relation to offline contests or competitions expressly subject to these privacy policy terms, the parental consent of the entrant is deemed to have been granted in respect of that particular contest or competition and in respect of any future online interaction with entrants upon receipt of personal information which is submitted or otherwise collected offline.
</p><p>Once a contest winner has been selected, that person will be contacted via the winner's email address given at the time of entry. If the email address has changed or been deleted or is no longer operational, the entry will become void. Cartoon Network will not be held responsible for invalid email addresses.

</p><p><b>Voluntary Submissions via Email</b>
</p><p>Cartoon Network enjoys interacting with its audience. Therefore, there will be opportunities for visitors to contact us online. In these areas, an email address will be collected, and in some cases, you may receive a response.
</p><p>In addition, sometimes you will have the choice to select the option to subscribe to a free online newsletter sent to the email address you provide. The newsletter will have fun, informative updates about <u>CartoonNetworkIndia.com</u>. When a child under 13 years of age requests this newsletter, we collect their email address as well as their parent's email address. Where practical and possible, we will attempt to send a notification to the parent of each such child informing them that the child has requested a free newsletter that will be sent to the child's email account. The parent can request at any time, through the options described in the notification, how to delete their child's email address from the newsletter subscription list. In addition, each time the newsletter is emailed, directions will clearly be stated how to remove oneself from the email newsletter list.

</p><p><b>Cookies: the non-edible kind</b>
</p><p>Cookies are tiny pieces of information that your browser stores on your computer, such as what browser you're using or what operating system you use.
</p><p>At <u>CartoonNetworkIndia.com</u>, we use cookies to help make your experience better and understand how well we're doing. We only use cookies so that we know how many visitors we have and how often they visit: that's the best way to know if you like what we're doing. Under no circumstances do we use cookies to collect or cross-relate personal information about you.

</p><p><b>Safeguards - Monitor Your Child's Internet Usage</b>
</p><p>As we have taken special precautions to aid in the safety of their children's World Wide Web experience, we ask parents to monitor closely the Internet activities of their children and become educated on the various Internet and software tools available so as to ensure that their children have a fun and satisfying on-line experience.

</p><p><b>Opt-In</b>
</p><p>If you tick the opt-in box at any part of this website, you will be accepting these privacy policy terms and our right to provide your information to selected third parties. We or they may contact you by mail, telephone or e-mail to let you know about services and products which may be of interest to you. You have the right to ask for a copy of the information held by us about you in our records in return for the payment of a small fee. You also have the right to correct any inaccuracies in the information.
