<p><strong>Effective: January 25, 2016</strong></p>

<p>This website is developed and maintained by Carnegie Learning, Inc. (hereinafter “Carnegie Learning,” “we” or “us”). &nbsp;This Privacy Policy communicates our Privacy practices to parents, teachers, and schools and school district administrators, collectively “you,” who license our products and services for either your own use or the use of your students.&nbsp; Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By continuing to interact with our digital properties, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy on behalf of yourself and your students.</p>

<p>When you visit our website, or use our software or mobile applications (“apps,”) collectively our “digital properties,” Carnegie Learning may collect and use certain information about you and your students.&nbsp; Carnegie Learning recognizes that you care about how your information, and the information of your students, is used.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy explains how we may collect and use your and your student’s information, particularly personal information, and the choices you can make about what information about you and your students is shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.carnegielearning.com">carnegielearning.com</a>, associated subdomains, our software and apps and covers information collected in connection with access and use of our digital properties. This Privacy Policy applies whether access or use of the digital properties is via personal computer, mobile device, or otherwise and to interactive features or downloads that are owned and operated by Carnegie Learning and that are available through the digital properties. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: While most of carnegielearning.com is a general audience website through which we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (“Children” and each, a “Child”), portions of the website, certain subdomains, our software, and our apps are directed to children under 13. These subdomains, software, and apps contain teaching and learning resources designed for students in 6th through 12th grades.&nbsp; Students may access those digital properties directed to children only after their teacher or school or school district administrator has entered into a license with Carnegie Learning and has provided the students with an access code. The subdomains, software, and apps that are directed to children will follow our <a href="#Children's Privacy Policy">Children’s Privacy Policy</a>.&nbsp; In addition, our use of student information is described in <a href="#Section 7">Section 7. How Does Carnegie Learning Handle Student Information</a>.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>We ask that you periodically review our Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The Policy will state its effective date, which is the most recent date on which we revised the Policy. Carnegie Learning reserves the right to make immaterial changes to our Privacy Policy that will not affect Carnegie Learning’s use of a user’s personally identifiable information at any time without any notice to you other than posting any such changes in a revised Privacy Policy on the our digital properties. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that increase our rights to use personal information we have previously collected about you, we will obtain your consent for those changes, as they relate both to your information, and to your students’ information, either through an email to your registered email address, or by prominent posting on our digital properties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Information Collected by Carnegie Learning, Inc.</strong></p>

<p>In some cases, the teachers, and schools and school district administrators who license our products and services enter into additional reporting or research agreements for the provision of reports that contain aggregate data by demographic categories (gender, ethnicity, free or reduced lunch status, etc.). In such cases, the teachers, schools and/or school district administrators &nbsp;provide Carnegie Learning with the information required to provide these reports, which may personally identify students. When such agreements are in place, reports containing this information are provided only to the teachers, and schools and school district administrators authorized to receive that information. In such cases, data is held securely and only Carnegie Learning employees directly involved in producing these reports have access to students’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Carnegie Learning does not collect or maintain any demographic, academic or other school record information about students, teachers or administrators unless it has a separate reporting or research agreement.</p>

<p>We may have different contractual terms and privacy policies in place with some of our customers. Those other terms and policies may supersede this Policy for information collected or released under those terms. If you have any questions as to what legal agreement or privacy policy controls the collection and use of your information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@carnegielearning.com">privacy@carnegielearning.com</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8.&nbsp; Use of Data for Research</strong></p>

<p>Carnegie Learning uses de-identified and aggregate data about students’ use of our digital properties for product development, research or other purposes. To de-identify data, we remove all direct and indirect personal identifiers. These identifiers include, but are not limited to, name, ID number, teacher name, class and school identifications. Carnegie Learning agrees not to attempt to re-identify any de-identified data. We may store de-identified data indefinitely.</p>

<p>Schools, school districts and individuals may ask for their data to be excluded from any de-identified data sets. To request such exclusion, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@carnegielearning.com">privacy@carnegielearning.com</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, for research and other purposes, Carnegie Learning may transfer de-identified data to third parties.&nbsp; For example, we may share information such as problems attempted, answers or hint requests for each step of the problem, and associated time stamps. We review all requests for such de-identified data sets, and we require all recipients of de-identified data sets to agree to the <a href="http://www.carnegielearning.com/carnegie-learning-private-dataset-terms-of-use">Carnegie Learning Private Dataset Terms of Use</a>, which prohibit, among other things, any attempts to re-identify the de-identified data and any commercial use of the data.</p>

<p>In connection with research studies, Carnegie Learning and/or its partners may publish or discuss aggregate data about student performance and results. Such publications never reference individual information, only aggregate statistics. Research projects that make use of such aggregate data are reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)&nbsp; which is responsible for approving the goals and procedures of the study, including those related to maintaining privacy of information. Such requirements may or may not include parental or student notification or approval. Schools or school districts provide prior consent to any research that involves interaction with the schools and their students’ information. Carnegie Learning is committed to abiding by IRB recommendations and requirements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. How Does Carnegie Learning Protect My Information?</strong></p>

<p>Carnegie Learning has implemented an information security program with numerous measures, including administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard information that can individually identify you against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.</p>

<p><em>Data Retention, Access, and Security</em></p>

<p>Carnegie Learning will ensure that all information in its possession and in the possession of any subcontractors or agents to which we may have transferred the information, is destroyed or de-identified within 90 days of the termination of our contract(s) with the customer or at the request of the customer.&nbsp; Any information held by Carnegie Learning will be made available to the customer upon request.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Children's Privacy Policy" name="Children's Privacy Policy"><strong>11. Children’s Privacy Policy</strong></a></h3>

<p>While most of carnegielearning.com is a general audience website that does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (“Children” and each, a “Child”), portions of the digital properties, are directed to children under 13, and we may collect information directly from children under 13 in connection with those portions of the digital properties.

<p>In the event of any acquisition, reorganization or merger &nbsp;of Carnegie Learning or its assets, your information may be transferred as part of the transaction to an assignee. The assignee will assume and be subject to the same obligations of the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy as Carnegie Learning. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Carnegie Learning may continue to use the information you provide to us as set forth in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use.
