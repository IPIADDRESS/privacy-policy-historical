                           Many areas of Carnegie Learning, Inc's websites are reserved for Carnegie Learning members 
                           who have registered with us; for example, chats, message boards and access to special services 
                           such as product documentation and online support. This is necessary so that Carnegie Learning, Inc.
                           can assure the quality of its forums. In some areas registration is free and in others requires that
                           your school participate in one of our annual SchoolCare programs.</p><p>
                           
                           The membership registration form currently requires you to choose a member name (your email address) 
                           and password and provide Carnegie Learning, Inc. with your first and last names.</p><p>

                           The personally identifiable information you provide during membership registration will not be 
                           given to third parties without your consent.</p><p>

                           Carnegie Learning's e-commerce partners, this transaction will occur on the e-commerce partner's 
                           site, not the Carnegie Learning Network and as such the financial and personally identifiable 
                           information you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of that e-commerce 
                           partner. It is important therefore that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy of 
                           the e-commerce site you transact with.</p><p>

                           Throughout the Carnegie Learning, Inc. Network various public forums such as chat rooms, 
                           message boards, and various question and answer areas are available to you as a registered

                           Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public 
                           information and is immediately accessible to other Carnegie Learning members on the Carnegie Learning, 
                           Inc. Network, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when 
                           deciding to reveal personal information in these areas. Carnegie Learning, Inc. may decide to 
                           utilize the content of Q&amp;A's, interactions with Carnegie Learning Staff, and/or chat room and 
                           message board content throughout the Carnegie Learning, Inc. Network and in promotions in order

                           Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally. 
                           In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any 
                           Carnegie Learning member or subscriber, such personally identifiable information is never provided to 
                           third parties without your consent. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information 
                           from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only. Some survey answers 
                           may be added to your member portrait (so that we can better provide you with content).</p><p>
