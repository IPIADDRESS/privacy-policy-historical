initial of your last name, city, state, profile picture, and if you are a Care Provider, your gender

chance you have of finding either care or a job. We may also share on your profile or job posting any
company reviews you have posted on our Site and whether you have connected to Care.com through Facebook.
If you are a Care Provider and have elected to verify certain information with Care.com or to have a
background check performed, we may also disclose that information in your profile in addition to any
payment or payroll preferences you have indicated. </p>
<p>If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, that

<p>We may display personal testimonials of Registered Users and other endorsements on our Site or in
other marking materials. These testimonials or endorsements may include Non Personal Information such

<h4> With other Registered Users and corporate providers</h4>
<p>In addition to the information that is provided to all visitors to Care.com, Care Provider reviews

addition, your approximate residential location (through Google map plotting) is made available to
certain Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential. </p>
<p>If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, you will appear in search result listings if you
match the search criteria used by a Care Provider or Care Seeker, as applicable. Similarly, you may
appear in emails sent to Care Providers or Care Seekers in your area. Care Seekers may opt-out of being
included in Care Provider search results and in certain emails sent to Care Providers. In addition, if
you are a Care Seeker and you view the profile of certain Care Providers, those Care Providers will be
able to see that you have viewed their profiles unless you opt-out of that information sharing. </p>
<p>If you are a Registered User, your Care.com online status may be made available to other Registered

to a corporate care provider's site from the Care.com site, any information you provide over the phone
or on the provider's site, you will be providing directly to the provider. In addition, if you contact
Care.com via phone or other channels to obtain information about senior care or other care options for
yourself or your loved ones, information you provide Care.com, including contact, health, financial and
other information may be forwarded to entity care providers that may meet your stated needs and
preferences so the care providers may evaluate your needs and preferences and contact you. If you provide
information about someone other than yourself, you represent that you have authority to provide us the
information and to authorize us to share the information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

with third party search engines and other vendors who run classified advertising businesses, and thus may be

the public and allow them to link to your Care.com posting. Registered Users can opt-out of this sharing by
adjusting their <a href="/account-preferences-p1016.html">account settings</a>. If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working

Changing or Removing your Personal Information and Closing your Account
</h2>
<p>If the Personal Information you provided when you registered changes, you may update this information
by logging into your account and accessing your <a href="/account-preferences-p1016.html">account settings</a>. If you would like to remove some of the Personal
Information you have posted on the Site, such as information you posted in profiles and job postings, you may do so
by editing or deleting that item in your My Profile &amp; Setting area or your My Job area. To request removal of other
Personal Information you have voluntarily posted on our Site, such as information you may have posted in online group
forums, contact <a href="mailto:careteam@care.com?subject=Request%20to%20remove%20information">careteam@care.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to reasonably accommodate your request to remove
your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. </p>
<p>If you no longer wish to participate in our Services you may close your account directly in the <a href="/account-preferences-p1016.html">account settings</a>
portion of your account.</p>
<p>If you close your Care.com account, we will remove your name and other Personal Information from our publicly viewable
database. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your
account information without liability. However, we may retain information related to you if we believe it may be necessary
to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, Non Personal
Information, account recovery, auditing our records, enforcing our rights and obligations under our agreements or if
required by law. Care.com may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Registered
Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person's
inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send to others through Care.com to other
Users, as well as your contributions to Care.com groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account.
Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that others have copied, may also remain visible. Care.com
disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation
not to delete the information. Care.com does not control when search engines update their search index or cache, which may
contain certain job post, profile or other information that has since been removed from Care.com's Site.</p>
