<i>This Privacy Policy was last revised on June 6, 2013.</i>
</p>
<p>
Causes created this application to make it simple for users to share
information about the issues they care about with their friends and others
with similar interests. We give you control of your information because you
may not want to share your information with everyone. You choose what
information you provide, including contact and personal information,
interests, and issues. You control the sharing of that information by using
the privacy settings on the application.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information you
may provide, how we use and share the information and how we will not use
or share information, and your choices when using the Causes application,
located at www.causes.com and apps.facebook.com/causes, (the
"Application"). We will not use or share your information with anyone,
except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions about the Privacy Policy or would like to suggest
improvements, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@causes.com">privacy@causes.com</a>
or Privacy Department, Causes, 88 Kearny St, Suite 2100, San Francisco, CA
94108 United States.
</p>
<p>
We operate under the principle that you should have control over your
information including how it is shared with others. To learn more about our
privacy practices, read on!
</p>
<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
<p>
While using the Application, you may provide us with anonymous information,
personal information and additional materials.
</p>
<p>
You provide us with anonymous information such as your IP address, areas of
the Application you have visited, time and date, and whether or not you
clicked on links. We use technologies such as cookies to collect this
information. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer. We
use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. Session cookies
terminate once the user closes the browser. We also use persistent cookies
that store other information to make it easier for you to login when you
come back to the Application. You can configure your browser to block
cookies; however, if you do, the Application may not function properly or
at all. If you choose to click on a link to any outside website, anonymous
information may be provided to that website.
</p>
<p>
You may provide us personal information if you register at the Application,
like your username, password, first and last names, email address, and
mailing address. You may provide additional personal information for your
profile.
</p>
<p>
You may also post information, opinions, voting records, text, sounds,
photographs, audio, video, images, graphics, and other content or materials
of any nature (collectively, "Materials") to the Application. You have
control of who sees this Material through your use of the privacy setting
available through the Application. If you choose, the Materials will be
viewable by other users.
</p>
<h2>Use of the Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
You are in control of sharing personal information that you provide to the
Application, including by using the privacy settings. If you choose to post
Materials directly to public portions of the Application such as campaigns,
forums, communities, or message boards, obviously those Materials may be
available to other users. Causes may use personal information you elect to
provide to us in order to provide products and/or services to you and, if
you elect, other users and for administration, maintenance, and development
of the Application.
</p>
<p>
Your personally identifiable information will not be sold to advertisers or
spammers.
</p>
<p>
If you provide your email address at the Application, we may use your email
address to contact you and notify you of any Application news. You can
choose which types of email you receive from us by changing your account
settings at the Application. Generally, you cannot opt-out of receiving
certain communications such as service-related announcements and
administrative messages, except by terminating your account.
</p>
<p>
Causes may use anonymous information collected to improve the quality of
the Application. This information may help us to diagnose problems,
maintain security, and provide services users want. Causes may determine
user demographics, interests, and behavior and may share such anonymous
information with others. For example, we may provide demographic or usage
information to an organization so they may see how many users are from a
specific geographic area or industry.
</p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>
We use remarketing and targeting services, such as those offered by Google
and other advertising partners, to advertise online and deliver
advertisements ("ads") that may be of interest to you. In connection with
this advertising, we, along with third-party business partners, use
first-party cookies and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick
cookie) to allow our third-party business partners, including Google, ad
servers, and ad networks, to serve you ads based on your prior visits to,
and browsing activities on, the Application and third-party web sites.
These ads are delivered to you on the Application and third-party websites
and services across the Internet. These third-party business partners use
technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and
ad links that appear on the Application and third-party sites, and will
automatically receive your IP address when they do so. Along with cookies,
we or our business partners may also use other technologies (such as
JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear GIFs) to compile
information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on
the Application, and to measure the effectiveness of the ads and to
optimize and personalize the advertising content. You may opt out of the
DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads">opt-out page</a>.
Google has
<a href="https://support.google.com/ads">additional information</a>
available about their
Advertising Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions. You may obtain
more information on how to opt out of ad cookies used by Causes or our
business partners by visiting
<a href="http://www.adroll.com/about/privacy">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please note that an advertiser may ask Causes to show an ad to a certain
audience of users (e.g., based on demographics, location, past browsing
history, or other interests). In that situation, Causes determines the
target audience using data gathered from IP addresses and first-party and
third-party cookies, and Causes serves the advertising to that audience and
only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond
to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the
description of the audience they are trying to reach. Causes does not sell,
rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you
from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for
such parties' own marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
The Causes Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective
privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more
information.
</p>
<h2>Spreading the Word</h2>
<p>
In order to spread the word and promote campaigns you care about you may
elect to opt in and take advantage of one of our optional promotion
services. If you choose to opt in, we will use the email addresses in your
address book to send a one-time email to those email addresses with
information about the Application. If you prefer, you may opt to provide a
friend's email address, and we will send that friend a one-time email
inviting the friend to visit the Application. We may use the email
information to track the success of these email services. Anyone we send an
email to through one of these features may contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@causes.com">privacy@causes.com</a>
to request that we remove their information from our database.
</p>
<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>
We share your personally identifiable information in three cases: (1) with
your permission, (2) as required by law, and (3) change of ownership, each
as more fully described in the paragraphs below.
</p>
<p>
You may opt in to allow third parties, such as nonprofits, to receive the
information you provide by checking the appropriate box when you are
providing information. If you tell us to share your information with a
third party, the third party's use of that information will be governed by
their privacy policy, not ours.
</p>
<p>
We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful
requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with
applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith
belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants
meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or
other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to
protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal
activity perpetrated through the Causes service or using the Causes name,
or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information
with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
</p>
<p>
If the ownership of all or substantially all of Causes' business, or
substantial portions of the business owned by Causes, were to change, your
information may be transferred to the new owner so the new owner can
continue providing services to you. In any such case, your information
would remain subject to the protections provided in our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
Please remember that anyone who has access to your username and password
may be able to access your personal information; therefore, we encourage
you to keep your password secret to prevent any unwanted access.
</p>
<h2>Deletions/Corrections/Updates</h2>
<p>
You can delete your account at your user profile page. You can also edit
your personal information to ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. You
may delete your information from the Application at any time.
</p>
<h2>Child Protection</h2>
<p>
Causes does not offer the Application to, or knowingly collect or solicit
information from, anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, do not
provide us with any information. Any information we receive from people we
believe to be under 13 will be purged from our database.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>
The Application may contain links to other websites, including of
nonprofits, PACs, and other organizations. Causes is not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of other websites that may be linked
to the Application.
</p>
<h2>Agreement</h2>
<p>
If you choose to use the Application, your use is subject to the current
Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (which is incorporated into and subject to
the Causes Terms of Use) and you consent to our limited use of information
as outlined in our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change this
Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do make changes, we will post any
changes on the Application and will indicate the date the changes were made
at the top of our Privacy Policy. Non-material changes are effective upon
posting. Material changes are effective 15 days after posting. Unless
stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information in
our possession.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Causes takes reasonable precautions to protect our users' information. Your
account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.
Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure
communications, we request that you not send private information to us by
email or instant messaging services. Although we allow you to set privacy
setting that limit access to your information, please be aware that no
security measures are perfect or 100% effective. We cannot control the
actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and
information. Even after removal, copies of Materials may remain viewable in
cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your
Materials. If you have any questions about the security of Causes
Application, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@causes.com">privacy@causes.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Opting out of communications</h2>
<p>
You can choose to opt out of receiving emails from Causes by
clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any such email, or visiting the
email preference by visiting your
<a href="/account/email">email preference page</a>
or
<a href="/unsubscribe">unsubscribe page</a>.
Please note that
once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for
your opt-out to become effective. Your unsubscribe or email preference
change will be processed promptly, and in no event longer than 10 business
days. Alternatively, you may email us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@causes.com">privacy@causes.com</a>
or reach us at the following contact information:
