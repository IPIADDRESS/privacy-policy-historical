  <h3>Personal Information Protection Policy</h3>

  <p>VirtEx is committed to safeguarding the personal information
    entrusted to us by our users. We manage your personal
    information in accordance with Alberta's Personal Information
    Protection Act and other applicable laws. This policy outlines the
    principles and practices we follow in protecting your personal
    information.</p>

  <p>This policy applies to VirtEx and its subsidiaries. The policy
    also applies to any person providing services on our behalf.</p>

  <h4>What is personal information?</h4>
  <p>Personal information means information about an identifiable
    individual. This includes an individual's name, home address and
    phone number, an identifying number, financial information,
    etc.</p>

  <h4>What personal information do we collect?</h4>
  <p>We collect only the personal information that we need for the
    purposes of providing services to our users, including personal
    information needed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>open and manage an account</li>
    <li>contact you about account changes</li>
    <li>manage account fund transfers</li>
    <li>follow up to determine satisfaction with services</li>
    <li>meet regulatory requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We normally collect user information directly from our
    clients. We may collect your information from other persons with
    your consent or as authorized by law.</p>

  <p>We inform our users, before or at the time of collecting personal
    information, of the purposes for which we are collecting the
    information. However, we don't provide this notification when a
    user volunteers information for an obvious purpose (for example,
    giving us your email for email money transfers)</p>

  <p>We ask for consent to collect, use or disclose client personal
    information, except in specific circumstances where collection,
    use or disclosure without consent is authorized or required by
    law. We may assume your consent in cases where you volunteer
    information for an obvious purpose.</p>

  <p>We ask for your express consent for some purposes and may not be
    able to provide certain services if you are unwilling to provide
    consent to the collection, use or disclosure of certain personal
    information. Where express consent is needed, we will normally ask
    clients to provide their consent via the website or email.</p>

  <p>In cases that do not involve sensitive personal information, we
    may rely on "opt-out" consent. For example, we may disclose your
    contact information to other organizations that we believe may be
    of interest to you, unless you request that we do not disclose
    your information. You can do this by contacting us via any other
    methods <a href="contact">here</a>.</p>

  <p>A client may withdraw consent to the use and disclosure of
    personal information at any time, unless the personal information
    is necessary for us to fulfil our legal obligations. We will
    respect your decision, but we may not be able to provide you with
    certain products and services if we do not have the necessary
    personal information.</p>

  <p>We may collect, use or disclose client personal information
    without consent only as authorized by law. For example, we may not
    request consent when the collection, use or disclosure is
    reasonable for an investigation or legal proceeding, to collect a
    debt owed to our organization, in an emergency that threatens
    life, health or safety, or when the personal information is from a
    public telephone directory.</p>

  <h4>How do we use and disclose personal information?</h4>
  <p>We use and disclose client personal information only for the
    purposes for which the information was collected, except as
    authorized by law. The law also allows us to use that contact
    information for the purpose of collecting a debt owed to our
    organization, should that be necessary.</p>

  <p>If we wish to use or disclose your personal information for any
    new business purpose, we will ask for your consent.</p>

  <h4>How do we safeguard personal information?</h4>
  <p>We make every reasonable effort to ensure that client information
    is accurate and complete. We rely on our clients to notify us if
    there is a change to their personal information that may affect
    their relationship with our organization. If you are aware of an
    error in our information about you, please let us know and we will
    correct it on request wherever possible.</p>

  <p>In some cases we may ask for a written request for correction.</p>

  <p>We protect client personal information in a manner appropriate
    for the sensitivity of the information. We make every reasonable
    effort to prevent any loss, misuse, disclosure or modification of
    personal information, as well as any unauthorized access to
    personal information. This site uses SSL 128 bit encryption for
    all data transfers over the Internet.</p>

  <p>We will notify the Office of the Information and Privacy
    Commissioner of Alberta, without delay, of a security breach
    affecting personal information if it creates a real risk of
    significant harm to individuals.</p>

  <p>We retain client personal information only as long as is
    reasonable to fulfil the purposes for which the information was
    collected or for legal or business purposes.</p>

  <p>We render client personal information non-identifying, or destroy
    records containing personal information once the information is no
    longer needed.</p>

  <p>We use appropriate security measures when destroying client
    personal information, including complete erasure of storage
    devices used to store electronic records.</p>

  <h4>Access to records containing personal information</h4>
  <p>Clients of VirtEx have a right of access to their own personal
    information in a record that is in our custody or under our
    control, subject to some exceptions. For example, organizations
    are required under the Personal Information Protection Act to
    refuse to provide access to information that would reveal personal
    information about another individual. Organizations are authorized
    under the Act to refuse access to personal information if
    disclosure would reveal confidential business information. Access
    may also be refused if the information is privileged or contained
    in mediation records.</p>

  <p>If we refuse a request in whole or in part, we will provide the
    reasons for the refusal. In some cases where exceptions to access
    apply, we may withhold that information and provide you with the
    remainder of the record.</p>

  <p>You may make a request for access to your personal information by
    writing to our Compiliance Officer. You must provide sufficient
    information in your request to allow us to identify the
    information you are seeking.</p>

  <p>You may also request information about our use of your personal
    information and any disclosure of that information to persons outside
    our organization.</p>

  <p>You may also request a correction of an error or omission in your
    personal information.</p>

  <p>We will respond to your request within 45 calendar days, unless
    an extension is granted.</p>

  <h4>Questions and complaints</h4>

  <p>If you have a question or concern about any collection, use or
    disclosure of personal information by VirtEx, or about a request
    for access to your own personal information, please contact our
    Compliance Officer. Contact details can be
    found <a href="contact">here</a>.</p>
