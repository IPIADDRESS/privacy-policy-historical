If you have provided your e-mail address to us or to a company we have partnered with to make their products and services available to you, we may send you e-mail offers. We may also send you e-mail offers if you have provided your e-mail address to a third party and have actively chosen or requested, on an opt-in basis, to receive e-mail offers from other parties. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data. These e-mail offers come directly from AnalytixInsight. You can always opt out from receiving e-mail offers from AnalytixInsight as described below in the section, “DECLINING E-MAIL OFFERS.”</p>
<p>When we send e-mails to you, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich html e-mails. If your e-mail address is html-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich html e-mails.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not provide your e-mail address to our business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from an AnalytixInsight business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send offers to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future offers from them.</p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver offers to people who we believe will find them of value. Offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Declining E-mail, Direct Mail or Telemarketing Offers.</strong>&nbsp;AnalytixInsight provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving e-mail, direct mail or telemarketing offers. Although some customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by changing your preferences in your account, or by following the link provided in any promotional email we send you or by emailing us at notices@AnalytixInsight.com. All e-mail, direct mail or telemarketing offers that you receive from AnalytixInsight will inform you of how to decline receiving further such offers.</p>
