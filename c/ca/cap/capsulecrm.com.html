    <h3 class="jump-target" id="applicable-data-protection-law">Applicable Data Protection Law</h3>
    <p>
        For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the data controller is Zestia Limited, a private limited company registered in England with number 06418281 whose registered office is at 20 Dale St, Manchester, M1 1EZ.
    </p>


    <h3 class="jump-target" id="where-we-store-your-personal-data">Where we store your Personal Data for EU Customers only</h3>
    <p>
        The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"). 
        It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. 
        Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. 
        By submitting your Personal Data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA. 
        We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We always ensure that your information is only transferred in full accordance with UK data protection laws and/or applicable EU data protection law. 
        In particular, this means that your information will only be transferred to a country that provides an adequate level of protection (for example, because the European Commission has determined that a country provides an adequate level of protection) or the recipient is bound by standard contractual clause according to conditions provided by the European Commission (“<strong>EU Model Clauses</strong>”). 
        You are responsible for checking the privacy policy of any third party websites we link to.            
    </p>

    <p>
        Our Service is accessible via the Internet and may potentially be accessed by any user around the world. 
        Other users may access the Service from outside the EEA. 
        This means that where you chose to upload your data to the Service, it could be accessed from anywhere around the world and therefore a transfer of your data outside of the EEA may be deemed to have occurred. 
        You consent to such transfer of your data for and by way of this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. 
        We ask you not to share any password with anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. 
        Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Service; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Service may contain links to and from third party websites of our partners, networks, advertisers and affiliate. 
        If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices or content of these websites.
    </p>

    <h3 class="jump-target" id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>
        We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and any amended Privacy Policy will be posted on our websites and notified to you by email, where appropriate. 
        Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.
