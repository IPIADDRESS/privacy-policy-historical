</p>

<h3>About Cookies</h3>
<p>
	A cookie is a text-only string of information that is stored by your browser when you navigate around a website.  
	Cookies are required to use the Capsule CRM service and are used in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To keep a session open after a user logs in.  This cookie will automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity or when the user explicitly logs out.</li>
	<li>
		To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. 
		We cannot identify you personally in this way.
	</li>
	<li>
		When a user has enabled 'Remember Me on This Computer' a cookie allows the user to access their account without logging in each time. 
		This cookie is removed when the user explicitly logs out.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>These cookies contain no personal information, but clearly users shouldn't enable 'Remember Me' when using a publicly-accessible computing device or terminal.</p>

<h3>You own your data</h3>
<p>
	Our Service, Capsule, is an online customer relationship management system which stores information as provided or entered by you (company or individual). 
	We will only store information that is entered by the users of your organisation, or automatically imported at a user’s instruction. 
	The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the users of an organisation remains the property of you and we will not use nor make available 
	for use any of this information without permission of you.
</p>

<h3>You control who has access to your data</h3>
<p>
	The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the users of your organisation is stored securely in a database and is only accessible to the approved users 
	of your organisation. Your administrator (the “Administrator”) will have full control over who is invited to be a user. 
	A user name and password is required in order to access your information in the Service.
</p>
<p>
	It is the user’s responsibility to keep their passwords safe. It is the Administrator’s responsibility to ensure that any users that are invited to use the 
	Service have permission to view the your information stored in the Service.
	Neither our staff nor our third party service partners have access to any user passwords and are therefore unable to access the organisation’s account or 
	data without receiving an invitation from the Administrator.
</p>
<p>
	You represent, warrant and undertake that when using the Service you will at all times comply with all applicable local and national laws including but 
	not limited to those relating to privacy and the processing of personal data and other information. 
	You agree to promptly comply with any request from us requiring you to amend, transfer and/or delete any information recorded by you on our Service. 
	You also agree to provide us with full co-operation and assistance in relation to any complaint, notice or communication which relates directly or 
	indirectly to the processing of personal data or other information or to your compliance with any applicable local and national laws.
</p>
<p>
	You agree to indemnify us and keep us indemnified and defend us at your own expense against all costs, claims, damages or expenses incurred by us or 
	for which the we may become liable due to any failure by you (or your employees or agents (where applicable)) to comply with your obligations under this
	Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>Your data is sent securely across the internet</h3>
<p>
	Our servers use SSL security certificates so all data transferred between your users and our servers is encrypted. 
	However, the internet is not in itself a secure environment. Users should only enter, or instruct the importation of, data to the database within a secure environment. 
	This means that the user’s browser must support the encryption security used in connection with the our servers.
</p>

<h3>Zestia will give you access to your data at any time</h3>
<p>On request, we will provide the Administrator with a full export of your data in a common file format determined by us.</p>
<p>Your data may be permanently deleted by us after you stop paying to use the Service, or at the Administrator’s request.</p>


<h3>We monitor system usage</h3>
<p>
	Zestia have access to and may use aggregate information such as number of associated users, number of transactions and billing information for the purpose of 
	billing and monitoring server and software performance as well as for other internal purposes.
</p>
<p>
	We will never access the details of any information entered and stored in the the Service. We will never access system usage history for a specific 
	identifiable user, except where granted permission by the user to assist with resolution of a system issue or error.
</p>
<p>
	Our staff may access non-identifying and aggregated usage information and transaction volumes in order to better understand how our customers are using 
	the Service so we can improve the system design and where appropriate have the system prompt users with suggestions on ways to improve their own use of the system. 
	All aggregated usage information is stored in a secure data warehouse facility.
</p>

<h3>This policy may be updated from time to time</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time and any amended policy will be posted on our Website.</p>
