During the registration process, a user is required to provide certain information, such as name, address, e-mail address, a password, date of birth, gender, country of citizenship, educational background, grades, and extracurricular activities. In addition, a user may choose to provide other information, such as intended major, career objectives, hobbies and other interests. This information may be updated and amended at any time after the initial registration.

<p><a href="#">back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="infoUse">2.	Use of Information</h3>
<p>The information you supply to Cappex.com enables us to provide the college search and matching services which you select by matching your background to the admission requirements and/or preferred student backgrounds of colleges and universities.  Participating colleges and universities may search the non-personally identifiable information of users (such as grade point averages or class standing, but not names or addresses) in order to decide which users they are interested in having apply for admission. Cappex will also recommend certain colleges and universities to students, and we will use a similar methodology to select which students should be informed of those opportunities. Under no circumstances will we share any of your personally identifiable information with colleges or universities without your consent. When a student appears to be a viable candidate for admission, a notice will be placed in your message in-box in the message center on our website, and we will send you an email that may contain a link to your message in-box. Once you have reviewed the notice in your message in-box, you may give us permission to release your contact information to such college or university so that they may directly contact you.</p>
<p>In addition, Cappex.com uses your information in order to customize our site to your interests and enhance your overall experience. Cappex.com uses various methods to recognize you, including requesting your e-mail address and password before accessing our site.

These third party service providers have agreed to hold and use your confidential information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our site, which are governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below.</p>
