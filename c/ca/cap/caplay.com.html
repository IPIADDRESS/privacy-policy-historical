      <p><br>
        Welcome to CAPLAY.com!<br>
        </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;">CAPLAY.com believes that maintaining and    preserving the privacy of user data is of the utmost importance. This Privacy    Policy represents a committed effort to safeguard the security of the limited    user information that is collected and retained on our servers. Please note    that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through    CAPLAY.com and not to information collected offline or to information you may    provide to any third-party sites to which CAPLAY.com may link, except as    expressly provided herein.<br>
        </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        There are two kinds of information that    CAPLAY.com can obtain about you: “Anonymous Information” and “Personally    Identifiable Information.”</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        “Anonymous Information” consists of    non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”)    address or domain, or information about your usage on CAPLAY.com that is used    for administrative purposes only. An Internet protocol ("IP")    address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service    Provider ("ISP"). CAPLAY.com may track such IP addresses for system    administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report    aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and    consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our    behalf, or to prevent our servers from being abused.</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        “Personally Identifiable Information” may    include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address. We do    not require this information to gain access to our sites, however, you will    not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require    registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information    is provided.</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        When we collect Personally Identifiable    Information from you, you will have the opportunity to “opt in” to receive    email or other digital communications from us and/or our business partners.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        If you have submitted your personal    information to<strong> CAPLAY</strong>.com, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally    Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is incorrect.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br>
        In all cases, we will only use your    information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this    Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information    to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that    such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process;    (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or    unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property    of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with    notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        <strong>Use of “Cookies”</strong></p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        Cookies are a feature of your Web browser    that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for    record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; CAPLAY.com    use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your    password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit CAPLAY.com. In    addition, CAPLAY may use cookies to retrieve user information for    promotional, marketing, or security purposes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><strong>Disclosure of Information through    Business Transfers</strong></p>
      <p style="line-height:18px;"><br>
        As we continue to develop our business,    we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so    doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information    may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion    or all of CAPLAY.com's assets are sold or transferred to a third party,    customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of    the transferred business assets.</p>
