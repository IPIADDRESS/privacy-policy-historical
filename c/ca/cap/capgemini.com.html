 <p class="lead"></p> <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Capgemini believes that the establishment of trust and privacy is instrumental 
to the continued growth of the Internet.&nbsp; We also believe that the efficient collection, 
use and transfer of information serve to enhance the development of the Internet 
and electronic commerce, provided that such information is handled in a fair and 
responsible manner. Therefore, in order to inform you of our policies and activities 
with respect to the collection, use and transfer of personal data on the Internet, 
Capgemini is providing you with an electronic copy of this Policy.&nbsp; This Policy 
applies to websites in the European Union that are owned and operated by Cap Gemini 
S.A. and/or companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly or indirectly (collectively, 
“Capgemini”), unless a particular website displays its own privacy policy (e.g., 
<a title="Sogeti" href="http://www.sogeti-transiciel.com/">http://www.sogeti-transiciel.com/</a>).&nbsp; Cap Gemini S.A. or one of companies that Cap Gemini S.A. controls, directly 
or indirectly, is the data controller with respect to personal data collected 
and processed via its respective website.&nbsp; In this capacity, each of these Capgemini 
entities is registered with appropriate data protection authorities with respect 
to the processing of personal data via such websites.</p>
<p>In this Policy, “Personal Data” means information which relates to an individual 
and which identifies that individual, either directly or indirectly (together 
with other information that is reasonably likely to come into Capgemini’s possession), 
such as your name, e-mail address or telephone number.</p>
<h2>Collection of Personal Data</h2>
<p>Generally, you can visit Capgemini websites without providing any Personal Data 
about yourself.&nbsp; However, for accessing some parts of our websites, such as downloading 
certain documents, or in connection with another specific purpose, we may need 
to collect Personal Data from you.&nbsp; Providing Personal Data to us in these events 
is voluntary.&nbsp; If you do not provide Personal Data to us, then you will not be 
able to benefit from the respective functionality offered by our websites, such 
as communication, downloading of documents or recruitment.&nbsp; The purposes, for 
which your Personal Data is collected, are described below, along with a brief 
description of how your Personal Data may be handled in each case.</p>
<ul>
<li value="0"><strong>Communicating with you</strong>.&nbsp; We will follow up on comments and other requests that you submit to us through 
our website, such as online queries or registering your attendance at a conference.&nbsp; 
This may include calling you back by telephone or communicating with you via email. 
</li>
<li value="0"><strong>Direct marketing and promotion</strong>.&nbsp; Direct marketing and/or promotional efforts by or on behalf of Capgemini may 
include providing you with specific information that you have requested online 
or providing more general information about other Capgemini offerings.&nbsp; When we 
collect Personal Data for direct marketing or promotional purposes, however, we 
generally offer you appropriate choices regarding the use of your Personal Data.&nbsp; 
</li>
<li value="0"><strong>Recruitment</strong>.&nbsp; If you submit a resume or job application online, we will use your Personal 
Data for recruitment-related purposes, which may include contacting you via email, 
telephone or post.&nbsp; In some cases, you may be required to register on our website 
in order that you may track the progress of your application online.&nbsp; Except where 
you request otherwise, Capgemini may keep your Personal Data on file for an appropriate 
time in order to consider you for other employment opportunities with Capgemini 
in the future. </li>
<li value="0"><strong>Supplier administration</strong>.&nbsp; Some Capgemini websites enable third-party suppliers to register their interest 
in supplying products and services to Capgemini.&nbsp; We will use this Personal Data 
in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with the supplier 
and for other procurement-related purposes. </li>
<li value="0"><strong>Discussion forums</strong>.&nbsp; If you choose to participate in Capgemini discussion forums or chat rooms 
then, in some cases, you may be required to register certain details, such as 
your name and email address.&nbsp; You should also be aware that your comments may 
be made broadly available to others, inside or outside Capgemini, depending on 
which particular discussion forum or chat room you are accessing. </li>
<li value="0"><strong>Maintaining the website and conducting customer satisfaction surveys</strong>. We will use your Personal Data in order to maintain and improve our website.&nbsp; 
We may also use your Personal Data in order to conduct customer satisfaction surveys. 
</li>
<li value="0">Compiling <strong>aggregate statistics</strong> regarding the use of its website. </li></ul>
<h2>Cookies and clicktrails</h2>
<p>We may collect information through our website by using cookies and clicktrails. 
All information collected by means of cookies or clicktrails will be anonymised, 
aggregated and only used to develop and track traffic patterns and the volume 
of use of our websites.&nbsp; Sometimes cookies are used to assist you in reaching 
the appropriate information and to tailor your visit to your individual preferences.&nbsp; 
For example, a cookie can be used to remember your login information if you choose 
the “Remember me” option while signing in.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive a cookie 
from our website, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you 
when you receive a cookie, which you may then refuse upon such notice.&nbsp; To understand 
how to do this, please consult your browser’s help section.&nbsp; However, refusing 
the cookies may prevent you from accessing some parts of the websites.</p>
<h2>Global organisation</h2>
<p>Capgemini is a global organisation.&nbsp; Whilst we have distinct legal entities (e.g., 
country subsidiaries) in many parts of the world, our internal processes and infrastructure 
are international in scope and nature and generally cross country borders.&nbsp; Accordingly, 
you should be aware that we may share your Personal Data inside Capgemini and 
transfer it to countries in the world where we have data centres or otherwise 
do business, including those located outside the European Union (EU).&nbsp; Some of 
these countries do not have specific data protection laws and so may provide less 
legal protection for your Personal Data.&nbsp; In these instances, Capgemini will process 
your Personal Data in the manner described by this Policy and in accordance with 
applicable law.</p>
<h2>Third-party suppliers</h2>
<p>Like many organisations, we use third-party suppliers to collect, use and otherwise 
process Personal Data on our behalf.&nbsp; Our practice is to require such third parties 
to handle Personal Data in accordance with Capgemini’s privacy and security policies.</p>
<h2>Business reorganisations</h2>
<p>Like many organisations, Capgemini may reorganise its business operations around 
the world from time to time, whether by buying new businesses or selling or merging 
existing businesses.&nbsp; This may involve us disclosing Personal Data to prospective 
or actual purchasers of parts of our business, or receiving personal data from 
potential sellers.&nbsp; It is our practice to seek appropriate confidentiality protection 
for Personal Data disclosed in these types of transactions.</p>
<h2>Legal disclosures</h2>
<p>Capgemini may disclose your Personal Data in order to enforce our website Terms 
of Use or in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety, the public or Capgemini’s 
websites.&nbsp; It is also possible that we may be required by law to disclose your 
Personal Data pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or 
orders, potentially, in any country where we do business. </p>
<h2>Sensitive Personal Data</h2>
<p>As a general rule, Capgemini does not collect “Sensitive Personal Data” through 
its website.&nbsp; “Sensitive Personal Data” means Personal Data concerning racial 
or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union 
membership, or concerning health or sex life.&nbsp; By volunteering unsolicited sensitive 
Personal Data to us (e.g., by submitting your resume or a job application online), 
you expressly consent to your Personal Data being used as described in this Policy.</p>
<h2>Accessing, correcting, updating and deleting Personal Data</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy, or would like to 
request a copy of your Personal Data, then please fill-in <a href="/contactus/?r_subject=Privacy+policy&amp;r_type=2">this form</a>. Also, if you consider your Personal Data to be incorrect or wish to have it 
deleted, then please either <a href="/registration/">sign-in</a> and update, correct or delete your profile on our website or fill-in <a href="/contactus/?r_subject=Privacy+policy&amp;r_type=2">this form</a> so that Capgemini may make any necessary updates, corrections and/or deletions.</p>
<h2>Data security and integrity</h2>
<p>Capgemini uses various technological and procedural security measures in order 
to protect the Personal Data we collect, use or transfer from loss, misuse, alteration 
or destruction.&nbsp; However, you should be aware that, due to the open and unsecured 
character of the Internet, Capgemini can not be responsible for the security of 
transmissions of the Personal Data over the Internet.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Third-party websites</h2>
<p>Capgemini websites may provide links to third-party websites. Capgemini does 
not make any representations or warranties with respect to such third-party websites. 
You should be aware that the owners and operators of such third-party websites 
might collect, use or transfer personal data under different terms and conditions 
than Capgemini. Upon linking to a third-party website, you should inform yourself 
of the privacy policies of such third party websites. You should also be aware 
that third-party websites may use cookies.</p>
<h2>Notification of changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>This Policy was last updated on February 20th 2006. In order to check updates 
to this Policy, please consult this page on a regular basis.</p>
