<p>This Online Privacy Policy (this "Policy")
  describes our online information practices and some of the choices you can
make about the ways we collect and use your personal information. </p>
<p>Particular pages of this Site may contain notices providing more details about
  the information we collect on those particular pages. Certain portions of this
  Site may contain notices advising you that different policies and practices
  apply to the information collected through those particular portions of this

  Policy. These additional notices are referred to as "Privacy Notices" in
  this Policy. </p>
<p>If you are a learner (or are applying to become a learner) at Capella, your
  personal information may also be protected under the Family Educational Rights
  and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). The provisions of FERPA supercede and
  govern over any contrary provisions in this Policy. <a href="/inc/pdf/pol_FERPA.pdf" target="_new">Learn more about FERPA
  and Capella's FERPA Compliance Program.</a> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="choices"></a><strong>Your Choices </strong> </p>
<p>We respect your right to make choices about

  describes some of your choices. In most cases, however, we will ask you to
  indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your personal

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="privacy"></a><strong>This Privacy Policy May Change </strong></p>
<p>Capella reserves the right
  to update or modify this Policy and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without
  prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice
  on this Site. If we modify this Policy or any Privacy Notice, the modifications
  will only apply to the personal information we collect after we have posted
the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. </p>
<p>Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your agreement
  that all information collected from or about you after the revised Policy is
  posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Policy. You may access the
  current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked "Privacy" at

<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="collected"></a><strong>What Information Is Collected on this Site and How Is It Used? </strong></p>
<p>When you access and use this Site, there are three ways we may collect information
about you: </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="knowingly"></a><strong><em>1. </em></strong><strong><em>Information You Knowingly and Voluntarily
Provide. </em></strong></p>
<p>Capella collects the information you knowingly and voluntarily
  provide when you use this Site, for example, the information you provide when
  you request information or a University Guide, complete a survey, or e-mail us
  with questions or feedback. In many cases, this information will identify you
  personally. </p>
<p>Capella uses the personal information you volunteer through this Site to provide
  the information, services and products you request. For example, we use the
  information you provide when you request a University Guide to deliver the
  University Guide to you, and we use your e-mail address to respond to your
comments or questions. </p>
<p>We may also use your contact information to follow up with you after you have
  expressed an interest in our programs. For example, after we send you our University
  Guide, we may telephone you to see if you have questions. We respect your privacy,
  however. If your telephone number is on a "Do Not Call" list, we will
  send you an e-mail requesting permission to call you and will only do so with
  your consent. </p>
<p>Unless you have "opted-out," we will add your contact information
  to our mailing lists and from time to time we will send you newsletters or
  updates, special offers, or other information about programs, services and
  products we believe would be of interest to you. You may "opt out" of receiving
  this information from us at any time by calling us at 1-888-CAPELLA (1-888-227-3552)
  option 3. If you are receiving e-mail from us and wish to unsubscribe, please
  click on the unsubscribe link provided in the e-mail you receive from us. </p>
<p>If we provide promotional information or materials to you by e-mail, we will
include a link to our "opt-out" page in every e-mail. </p>
<p>Finally, we may study the personal information collected through this Site
  to improve our programs and services, to improve the content, functionality,
  navigation, and usability of this Site; to better understand the needs and interests
  of learners, alumni, and the other constituencies we serve; and to better market
  our programs, services, and products. We may also remove all the personally
  identifiable information and use the rest for historical, statistical, or scientific
purposes. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="sent"></a> <strong><em>2. Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser </em></strong>  </p>
<p>Capella
  collects information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser.
  This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service
  provider, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or Macintosh®),
  and the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape® or Internet
  Explorer®). The information we receive depends on the settings on your
  Web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information
your browser sends or how to change your settings. </p>
<p>The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally.
  Unless you access this Site through an e-mail we have sent you or have created
  a "user identity" by creating an account during one of your visits, this
  information will not be linked to information that identifies you personally.
  We use this information to create statistics that help us improve our Site
  and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="cookie"></a><strong><em>3. Information Collected By Placing a "Cookie" On Your Computer </em></strong> </p>
<p>Capella
  may obtain information about you by installing a cookie on your computer's
  hard drive. A cookie is a piece of Web code that is used primarily for one
  or more of the following: analysis of Web site traffic and user behavior, application
  functionality, and data storage. We use two types of cookies: "session cookies" and "persistent
cookies." </p>
<p>We use "session cookies" to assign a randomly-generated unique identification
  number to your computer. A session cookie does not identify you personally,
  and expires (i.e., is automatically deleted from your computer) after you close
  your browser. We use session cookies to collect statistical information about
  the ways visitors use our site — which pages they visit, which links they use,
  and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as
  "clickstream data") to better understand our visitors' interests and needs
  and to improve the content and functionality of our sites. We do not link this
  information with any information that identifies you personally. </p>
<p>We use "persistent cookies" (cookies that do not expire when you
  close your browser) for several purposes. Like session cookies, they are used
  to assign a unique identifier to your computer, but because they are persistent,
  they permit us to recognize your computer each time you use it to access the
  Site. By using persistent cookies, we can collect and analyze clickstream data
  from more than one visit to the Site. Cookies are also used to store information
  you have previously provided such as your user ID or shipping address that
  can be displayed back to you automatically each time you visit the Site. Persistent
  cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or until they expire.
Expiration durations vary and are set by Capella. </p>
<p>Finally, both types of cookies (persistent and session) are occasionally used
  to facilitate the proper functioning of our applications and features of the
Site. </p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject
  cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although
  you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be
  unable to use all of the functionality of the Site if your browser rejects
our cookies. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="use"></a><strong>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies by Our Third-Party
  Ad Servers</strong> </p>
<p>Capella uses reputable third-party advertising companies
  to present ("serve") ads on our behalf. These third-party ad servers
  may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to help present and better
  target our advertisements, to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements,
  or to customize the content of the advertisements presented to you. Cookies
  are small text files that are placed on your computer's browser that can be
  used to help recognize you as someone who may be interested in online learning.
  Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used,
  among other things, to deliver a cookie to the browser of a computer accessing
  that page. <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy/process/" target="_new">More information about our third-party ad servers, the technologies
  they use, and how you can disable or "opt-out" from receiving their cookies. </a></p>
<p>Sometimes Capella uses third party advertising companies to help us with our
  e-mail marketing campaigns. These third-party advertising companies may include
  cookies in the e-mails they send on our behalf. These cookies do not identify
  you personally. They do not track your use of the Internet or cause pop-up
  ads to appear. They are used to help the Web sites you visit recognize you
  as someone with an interest in online education and to customize the content
  of the ads presented to you. Your browser can not screen out cookies that are
  sent by e-mail, but you can easily disable these cookies by visiting the ad
  server's Web site and following the instructions posted there. <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy/blocking" target="_new">View
links to our ad server's Web sites.</a></p>
<p>The use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these third party
advertising companies is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered
by our privacy policy.</p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="data"></a><strong> Does Capella Share My Personal Data? </strong></p>
<p>Capella may share personal information collected through this Site with companies
  and organizations who perform certain functions on our behalf, for example,
  companies that provide support services to us or that help us market our products
  and services (such as third-party advertising companies and colleges with whom
  we have referral relationships). These third parties are required by contract
  to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services
  on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential.
  To learn which third-party service providers we use, please contact us at 612-977-5662<strong>.</strong> <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy/controlling/" target="_new">Learn
  more about the ways our third-party advertising companies use cookies and other
technologies to increase the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>There are other limited circumstances in which Capella may share or transfer
  the personal information in our databases to unrelated third parties. For example,
  we may provide personal information to a third party when we believe it is
  necessary to comply with U.S. Department of Education reporting requirements
  or the reporting requirements of accrediting bodies; to prevent or investigate
  a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to comply with a court order
  or subpoena; to comply with a legal requirement; to enforce a contract; to
  protect the rights, property, or safety of Capella, our users or others; to
  protect your vital interests; or in connection with a corporate sale, purchase,
  merger, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar event. In particular,
  we exchange personal information in our databases with other companies and
  organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes. When
  we disclose information under these or similar circumstances, we will take
appropriate steps to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="protect"></a><strong>How Does Capella Protect Personal Information? </strong></p>
<p> Although Capella cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized
  disclosure, alteration or destruction of personal information, we take measures
  to prevent such occurrences. Our servers and databases are protected by firewalls
  and passwords. In addition, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt
  data as it travels between your computer and our servers. When you see a solid
  key or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, this
indicates that your transmission will be protected by SSL technology. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><a name="children"></a><strong>Does Capella Collect Personal Information From Children Through This Site? </strong></p>
<p> Capella does not knowingly collect personal information from children under
  the age of thirteen through this Site. If you are under thirteen, please do
  not give us any information that identifies you personally. If you have reason
  to believe that your child has provided personal information to Capella through
  this Site, please contact us, and we will use reasonable efforts to delete
that information from our databases. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>

<p>This Site contains links to other Web sites operated by Capella. This Site
  also contains links to Web sites that are owned and operated by unrelated third
  parties. For example, this Site contains links to a wide spectrum of resources
  that may be useful to Learners. In addition, this Site contains links to Web sites
  operated by third parties who provide services to Capella. For example, Capella
  uses a third-party service provider to process credit card transactions. If
  you wish to make a payment by credit card, we will ask you to click on a link
that will take you to our service provider's Web sites. </p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies only to personal information collected through
  this Site. It does not apply to personal information collected on any other
  Web sites operated by Capella, nor to personal information collected on our service
  providers' or other third-party Web sites. When you access other Web sites through
  a link on this Site, please take a few minutes to review the terms of use and
privacy statement posted on each Web site you visit. </p><p> <a href="#top"><img src="/img/btn_back_to_top.gif" alt="back to top" width="72" height="12" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
