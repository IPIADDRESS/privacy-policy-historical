<h2>August 7, 2007</h2>

<p>Welcome to CaptainU.com, a Web-based communication tool for high school and
youth club soccer players, college soccer coaches, and high school and club
soccer coaches, operated by CaptainU, LLC (“CaptainU”). To enrich our members'
experience, we request and display some personal information to other members
and visitors, which allows our Users to identify each other and expand their
network. CaptainU members can change their profile information at any time and
can control how other members and CaptainU communicate with them. </p>

<p>CaptainU is committed to respecting the privacy of our Users. We strive to
provide a safe, secure User experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the
online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to CaptainU
Tools and do not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Collection and Use of Information by CaptainU.</strong> In some
areas of CaptainU, we request or may request that you provide personal
information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number,
credit card number, contact information, billing information and any other
information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we
collect or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such
as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes
we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of information. </p>

<p>We also collect certain information about your use of CaptainU, such as
what areas of the website you visit and the hardware and software you use to
access CaptainU. This information may include your IP address, browser type,
domain names, access times and referring websites. This information is not
linked to your personal information.</p>

<p>We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive,
cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about
yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If
you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that
information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this
Privacy Statement. </p>

<p>We may also use a User's email address to send updates, a newsletter or
news regarding CaptainU. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by
changing their "notification" setting in the User "Account Settings."</p>

<p><strong>User Content.</strong> User Content (as defined in the CaptainU
Terms of Use) is posted on CaptainU at your own risk. Although we limit access
to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or
impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other Users with
whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot
and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed
by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any
privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand
and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain
viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored
your User Content. </p>

<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on CaptainU is a
violation of the CaptainU Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:info@captainu.com">info@captainu.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>User invitations.</strong> If you use our Invite feature to tell a
friend about CaptainU, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We
will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to
visit the site. CaptainU stores this information to send this one-time email,
to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track
the outcomes of User invitations. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@captainu.com">info@captainu.com</a> to request that we
remove this information from our database.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Cookies.</strong> We use "cookies" to help personalize and
maximize your experience on CaptainU. A cookie is a standard technology that
is used by many websites. It is a small piece of data that is sent from a web
server and stored on a User’s web browser. We use the information we obtain
from cookies to improve the usability of the Website. Cookies are uniquely
assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain
that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you
have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CaptainU
pages, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information. Because of our
use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more
personalized site experience. When you return to CaptainU, the information you
previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that
you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load
balancing.</p>

<p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify
your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit
you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to
decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact
your experience with CaptainU.</p>

<p><strong>Posting to Public Areas of CaptainU.</strong> Please remember that
if you post any of your personal information in public areas of CaptainU, such
as message boards, and other public forums, such information may be collected
and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for
the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make
available in public areas of CaptainU. </p>

<p><strong>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information.</strong> CaptainU
Users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by
logging into their account and accessing features such as ‘Edit Profile’ and
‘Account Settings’.</p>

<p><strong>Email Choice/Opt-out.</strong> Members who no longer wish to
receive updates or notifications may choose not to by selecting 'Do not send
me notification emails' in the User profile 'Account Settings'. Users who do
not wish to receive CaptainU newsletters may choose not to by selecting 'Do
not send me CaptainU newsletters' in the User profile 'Account Settings'. All
notification emails and CaptainU newsletters also include the above
instructions for opting-out of those communications in the future. Even if you
opt out of all voluntary email notifications, CaptainU reserves the right to
send you notices about your account.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Information CaptainU Collects.</strong>
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement and the Terms of Use
Agreement, CaptainU will not disclose personal information to any third party
who is not a User unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to
conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or
other legal process received by CaptainU, whether or not a response is
required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the CaptainU Terms of Use Agreement
or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the
public and CaptainU Users. CaptainU reserves the right to transfer personal
information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that
information as a result of the sale of CaptainU or substantially all of its
assets to that successor in interest</p>

<p><strong>Security of the Personal Information.</strong> We have implemented
commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to
secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use
your personal information for improper purposes. When you use CaptainU’s
electronic commerce feature, your credit card information is protected through
the use of Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption. SSL makes it difficult for
your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being
transmitted. We use a leading e-commerce service company to process all credit
card transactions. </p>

<p><strong>Third Party Advertising.</strong> Advertisements that appear on our
website may be delivered to Users by CaptainU or one of our advertising
partners and may contain cookies. These cookies allow us to deliver targeted
advertisements that we believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy
statement covers the use of cookies by CaptainU and does not cover the use of
cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p><strong>Links.</strong> CaptainU contains links to external websites.
CaptainU is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other
websites. When linking to another site a User should read the privacy policy
on that website. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on
CaptainU.</p>

<p><strong>Children under the age of 14.</strong> CaptainU is not intended for
children under 14 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal
information from children under 14. If you are under 14, please do not
register for CaptainU or send any information about yourself to us, including
your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 14
may provide any personal information to or on CaptainU. In the event that we
learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 14
without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as
quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or
about a child under 14, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@captainu.com">info@captainu.com</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Children Between the Ages of 14 and 18.</strong> We recommend that
minors over the age of 14 ask their parents for permission before sending any
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. </p>

<p><strong>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions.</strong> Your use of CaptainU,
and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as
our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including
arbitration, limitation on liability and choice of law. By using CaptainU, you
accept this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>

<p><strong>Changes in Our Privacy Policy.</strong> We reserve the right to
change our Privacy Policy at any time. Minor changes and clarifications will
take effect immediately, and significant changes will take effect within 30
days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post them and
will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. If we
make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or
through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy on
an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless
stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that
we have about you and your account.</p>
