<h2>CaptainU Privacy Policy (Revised 12/15/2011)</h2>

<h4>June 15, 2009</h4>

<p>Welcome to CaptainU.com, a Web-based college sports recruiting tool for high school and youth club athletes and their parents, college coaches, and high school and club coaches, operated by CaptainU, LLC (“CaptainU”). To enrich our members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network. Each CaptainU member can control what is in his or her profile and can control how other members and CaptainU communicate with them. </p>
<p>CaptainU respects your privacy and is committed to adhering to federal and state privacy laws and industry guidelines in order to protect the identity of visitors to our Websites, whether such visitors: (1)&nbsp;simply browse the Website without registering (each, a “Guest”); or (2)&nbsp;register with CaptainU (each, a “Member”) to use a “Membership” account.  The term “User” refers to a Guest or a Member.  We strive to provide a safe, secure User experience. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the personal information that you provide on each Website of CaptainU and its affiliates (collectively, the “Website”) and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion, or to information collected on any third party site that may be accessible from the Website. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is part of the Website’s <a href="http://www.captainu.com/pages/terms_of_use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.  Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using the Website or submitting information to CaptainU.  Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and your continued use of the Website is acceptance of such changes, so please check this area periodically for updates to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Collection and Use of Information by CaptainU.</b> In some areas of the CaptainU Website, we may request that you provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we may request a combination of the two types of information.  We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily.  If you choose to register as a Member with the Website, during the registration process you will be asked for both personal and demographic information, most of which is required in order to complete the registration.  If you opt not to register with the Website, you can still visit the Website as a Guest but you will not be able to access certain areas of the Website.  Your contact information and financial information (credit card number) will be used for the purposes for which you supplied it to us (e.g., registering with the Website, processing orders, etc.), to send you related notices or promotional materials and to respond to your comments or requests for information.  If you direct comments to us or you request information from us, we may ask you to verify certain information, such as your current or prospective location, so that we can provide the response or information that we believe is most appropriate.  We may also enhance or merge personally identifiable information with data obtained from third parties for the same purpose.</p>
<p>CaptainU does not have control over the privacy policies applied by any other party that you may disclose information to.  Third party sites that are linked to from the Website are not under the control of CaptainU and we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies.  If you would like information on any other party’s privacy policy, you should contact that party directly, and we encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We may also collect certain information about your use of the Website, such as what areas of the Website you visit and the hardware and software you use to access the Website. This information may include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web sites.</p>

<p>We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><b>User Content.</b> You are responsible for the content that you publish or display (hereinafter, "post") on the Website, or transmit to other Users (collectively, “User Content”).  Your User Content is posted on the Website at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content. </p>

<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the Website is a violation of the CaptainU Terms of Use and should be reported to help@captainu.com.</p>

<p><b>User invitations.</b> If you use our Invite feature to tell a friend about the Website, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. CaptainU stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the outcomes of User invitations. Your friend may contact us at help@captainu.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<p><b>Use of Cookies.</b> We may store some information on your computer, in the form of a "cookie" or similar file, to help personalize and maximize your experience on the Website. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a Web site or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.  A cookie is a standard technology that is used by many Web sites. It is a small piece of data that is sent from a Web server and stored on your Web browser.</p>

<p>We use the information we obtain from any cookies to improve the usability of the Website, by collecting information to understand what areas of the Website are most popular, which areas may require improvement and what technologies are being used by our visitors.  This information helps us to update and improve the Website.  We may also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security breaches and to provide you with a safe online environment.</p>

<p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience with CaptainU.  Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.</p>
<p><b>Posting to Public Areas of CaptainU.</b> Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of the Website, such as message boards, and other public forums, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Website.</p>

<p><b>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information.</b> You may modify or remove your personal information by logging into your account and accessing features such as ‘Edit Profile’ and ‘Account Settings’.</p>

<p><b>Sharing and Disclosure of Information CaptainU Collects.</b> Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy and the CaptainU Terms of Use, CaptainU will not disclose personal information collected through the Website without your consent to any third party who is not a User unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by CaptainU, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the CaptainU Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and CaptainU Users.  CaptainU may provide aggregate statistics about our Users, online traffic patterns and related information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information.  CaptainU may disclose your personal information to the reputable vendors that assist us in processing information or delivering items that you order.  These vendors are restricted from using the information for any purpose other than helping us to provide products and services.  CaptainU may disclose your personal information to accredited colleges and universities that you have indicated you are interested in attending. CaptainU reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of CaptainU or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.  CaptainU does not otherwise distribute to third parties your personally identifiable information.  CaptainU, however, will have no liability for disclosure of information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized intervention of third parties.</p>

<p><b>Security of the Personal Information.</b> We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. When you use the Website’s electronic commerce feature, your credit card information is protected through the use of Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. We use a leading e-commerce service company to process all credit card transactions. </p>

<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  If you have access to password-protected features, never share your password with anyone else, notify us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached, and remember to log off of the Website before you leave your computer.  We further urge you to be careful about giving out personal information in public areas of the Website like message boards.  When you provide information in these forums you do so at your own risk.  The information you share may be viewed by any User of the Website.  </p>

<p><b>Third Party Advertising.</b> Advertisements that appear on the Website may be delivered to Users by CaptainU or one of our advertising partners and may solicit, or contain cookies or other technology to collect, information from our Users. This information is collected and used by our advertisers and is outside of our control. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by CaptainU and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  If you have any questions about an advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser directly.</p>
<p><b>Links.</b> The Website contains links to external Web sites. CaptainU is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other Web sites. When linking to another site a User should read the privacy policy on that Web site. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Website.</p>

<p><b>Children under the age of 14.</b> The Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not register as a Member or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Website. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at help@captainu.com. </p>

<p><b>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18.</b> We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to us or anyone else over the Internet. </p>

<p><b>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions.</b> Your use of the Website, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on liability and choice of law. By using the Website, you accept this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>

<p><b>Changes in Our Privacy Policy.</b> We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time. Minor changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and significant changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on the Website. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the Privacy Policy’s new effective date. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through a notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>

<p><b>How to Contact CaptainU.</b>  If you have submitted personally identifiable information through the Website or an interactive advertisement, or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information through the Website or an interactive advertisement, and you would like to have that information deleted from our marketing databases, please contact us via e-mail at help@captainu.com.  We will then use reasonable efforts to remove your personally identifiable information from our files. You also may contact us to request the personally identifiable information that CaptainU has collected about you through the Website or interactive advertisements.  CaptainU will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information.</p>
