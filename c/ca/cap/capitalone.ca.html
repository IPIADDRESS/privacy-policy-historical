                      <p class="subhead">Capital One Privacy Statement</p>

                      <p>At Capital One, we understand that the protection of consumers' privacy is an
                      important public concern. Accordingly, we have adopted this Privacy Statement to
                      serve as the foundation for our internal privacy policies and procedures. It is our
                      commitment to providing meaningful privacy protection for our customers.</p>

                         <ol><li>Information Quality<br>
                           We maintain procedures to assure that the personal information we collect is
                           accurate, up-to-date and as complete as possible. If we obtain information
                           about consumers who are not our current customers, we strive to treat this
                           information in the same manner as we treat information about our existing
                           customers. </li>
                         <li>Use Of Customer Information<br>
                           We collect personal information from our customers themselves, from when
                           we provide products or services to our customers and from consumer
                           reporting agencies and other outside sources. We use personal information
                           only for purposes of administering our business activities, providing service
                           and making available other products and services to our customers and
                           prospective customers. </li>
                         <li>Do Not Solicit Option<br>
                           We recognize that some of our customers do not want to be solicited for
                           offers and promotions from us. So, we provide our customers the option to
                           have their names and addresses removed from our mail and/or telephone
                           solicitation lists. We have procedures that assure a consumer's name,
                           address and telephone number are removed from our marketing lists. </li>
                         <li>Information Security<br>
                           We maintain technical and organizational safeguards to protect the
                           confidentiality of personal information about our customers against (i)
                           unauthorized access or disclosure, and (ii) accidental loss, alteration or
                           destruction. </li>
                         <li>Maintaining Customer Privacy With Our Business Partners<br>
                           We strive to ensure that the companies we use as our business partners
                           support our commitment to privacy protection in their handling of personal
                           data about our customers. </li>
                         <li>Employee Education<br>
                           We provide training to our employees about their responsibilities under this
                           Privacy Statement, and we expect them to do their parts in protecting our
                           customers' privacy. We also conduct regular internal audits to support our
                           commitment. </li>
                         <li>Privacy Statement Is Available To Customers<br>
                           We want our customers to know about our commitment to providing privacy
                           protection. Therefore, this Privacy Statement is available upon request to
                           customers, shareholders, employees, governmental authorities and members
                           of the general public. </li></ol>

                      <p class="subhead">Online Applications</p>

                      <p>If you submit an online application, access your personal account information or
                      send Capital One an e-mail, Capital One may enter the information you send into its
                      electronic database. You may also be contacted by Capital One for additional
                      information. If Capital One uses a business partner to help it deliver the services to
                      you, your personal information will be retained on either Capital One's system or its
                      business partner's system in order to provide you with the services you have
                      requested.</p>

                      <p>Most of the forms on our Web site encrypt the information you send on the Internet
                      to Capital One and the information we send back to you. If a form requests
                      confidential information, such as your account number, credit card number or social
                      insurance number, we will use encryption technology to protect your privacy. If you
                      want to transmit information to Capital One outside the form, the transmission may
                      not be encrypted and it is not necessarily secure against interception. If your
                      communication to Capital One outside the form is very sensitive or confidential, you
                      may want to call Capital One or send that communication by regular mail rather
                      than ordinary e-mail.</p>

                      <p class="subhead">Types of Information</p>

                      <p>Anytime you visit our Web site, Capital One may collect and store information about
                      your visit, such as the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for
                      example, aol.com if you are connected from an America Online account), the date
                      and time of your visit, the Internet address of the Web site you left to visit Capital
                      One, the names of the pages you visit while at our Web site and the Internet address
                      of the site you then visit. If you are using our online services to access your account
                      information or to complete financial transactions, information about these
                      transactions may be collected and reviewed by Capital One-authorized individuals.</p>

                      <p class="subhead">Collection and Use</p>

                      <p>When you use various calculators, planners or questionnaires on our site, you may
                      be asked for personal information in order to complete the requested analysis or
                      evaluation. This information may be retained and used by Capital One.</p>

                      <p>Electronic technologies assist Capital One in collecting information while you visit
                      our Web site. The information gained through the use of such technologies may
                      allow us to offer you the kinds of products and services you like and determine that
                      your visit is in accordance with our web Terms of Use.</p>

                      <p>For example, Capital One's Web site, like many others, uses "cookies." This small
                      electronic file, which may be written to your hard drive when you visit our Web site,
                      may be used to help Capital One understand what parts of our Web site visitors find
                      most useful. If you choose, you can set up your web browser not to accept cookies.
                      A decision not to accept cookies can limit your access to some of the functionality
                      and services that are available on our Web site.</p>
