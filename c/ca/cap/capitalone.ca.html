<div id="changes-text" class="plain-text">
  <h3>2.  Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our current privacy practices. We update this
Policy on an ongoing basis to ensure consumers, applicants and customers are aware of updates to our privacy practices, to streamline those practices and to comply with applicable laws. Consumers are individuals who are not currently our customers; applicants are individuals who apply to become our customers; and customers are individuals who have been approved, use or have used our products and services in the past. Please visit this site regularly for updates. We will also notify individuals with whom we have a relationship of any material changes that may impact them.</p>

<div id="accountability-text" class="plain-text">
  <h3>3.  Accountability</h3>
<p>Our Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring that we comply with this Policy and applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>We are responsible for personal information in our possession or custody, as well as personal information transferred to a third party for processing. More details on our third parties are provided below under “Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention”.</p>

  <a id="collection" target="_self"></a><h3>4.  Information We Collect, and Limiting Collection</h3>
<p>Except where information is required to fulfill an identified purpose, you get to decide
what information you want to share with us.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting with us.</strong> We may collect information you provide if you visit or use our
website or apps, register or apply for one of our products or services, interact with us through social media or online ads, participate in surveys, or engage with us in any way.
We may collect that information for uses as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information about you.</strong> If you sign up for one of our products or services, depending on the service, we may collect information about your transactions, including purchases, account balances, fees, payment history, parties to transactions and credit card usage. We may collect information from credit reporting agencies and other outside sources to verify financial information about you, such as your employment and credit history. If you give us your SIN, we may use it to identify you with credit reporting agencies and other parties; we may keep this information along with other information about you in our records, even after your account is closed. When you provide authorized user information, we expect that you have authority to consent to its collection, use, and disclosure as outlined in this Policy.</p>
<a id="digital" target="_self"></a><p><strong>Digital and online information.</strong> We may collect information from your mobile and online activity; for example, Internet Protocol (IP) address, mobile device ID, application and website use, and history. Cookies (small computer files that a website’s server places on your computer) collect information about your online behaviour. You can set your browser to reject cookies, but this may impair our ability to customize and test your experience, like remembering your preferred language or present province-specific information to you.</p>
<p><strong>Third party service providers.</strong> We may collect information about you from third parties that we have contracted with, such as credit reporting agencies or affiliates. We may collect publicly available information about you from online sources, or from surveys that you participate in.</p>
<p><strong>Communication.</strong> When you have a telephone conversation with one of our representatives, your call may be recorded for quality and training purposes, as well as to resolve concerns. If you choose to contact us by email or mail, we may retain your email address, the content of your communication and our response.</p>
</div>



<div id="identifying-text" class="plain-text">
  <h3>5.  Identifying Purposes</h3>
<p>Capital One clearly identifies the purposes for which personal information is collected, used or disclosed prior to, or at the time of, collection, and as in our cardholder agreement.</p>
<a id="contact" target="_self"></a><p><strong>We may use your information to contact you.</strong> Your information allows us to contact you by various methods, including mail, email, SMS message, and telephone at the contact points you’ve provided to us. We will contact you to respond to your questions, proactively provide you with information about your account(s) with us, inform you about our products and services, and update you on changes to our website, mobile app, and other digital services we provide. We may use your information to send you important updates about your application status and account opening disclosures, and important or useful messages about your account(s). When you communicate online or by email, you should be aware that sending information over the internet isn’t secure, as it can be intercepted and/or manipulated and retransmitted.</p>
<a id="authenticate" target="_self"></a><p><strong>We may use your information to authenticate you.</strong> With your information, we can confirm your identity by sharing your information with the credit agency to authenticate you when you apply for a product or service, to verify that it’s you we are speaking with when you call our Customer Service number to discuss your account, or identify you when you visit us online or on our mobile app.</p>
<a id="assess" target="_self"></a><p><strong>We may use your information to assess your creditworthiness.</strong> With your information, we can assess your creditworthiness to determine your eligibility for products and services, and process your application(s). This information is helpful for us to offer you product choices that are suitable for you.
