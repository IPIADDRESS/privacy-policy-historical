            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the CashCashPinoy websites (collectively, the “Website”). Moonline Corp., the provider of the Website (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you (the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us.<br> <br><div class="block-blue"><div class="block-blue-content">PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.</div></div><br> <br><h4>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h4><br>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Privacy Policy in the “Privacy Policy” section of the Website. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each User to review the Website and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. <br><br><br><h4>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h4><br>We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.<br><br>Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.<br><br>We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient. We may use that other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested we send. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.<br><br>Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.<br> <br>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.<br> <br><br><h4>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h4><br>We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:<br> <br>We share your information with CashCashPinoy Merchants. We are able to provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as “CashCashPinoy Merchants”) who, as part of the offer, could request information on CashCashPinoy customers who purchased the offer. In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with CashCashPinoy Merchants. Sharing this Information will allow a CashCashPinoy Merchant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information with a CashCashPinoy Merchant if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the CashCashPinoy Merchant involved in that Identification Activity. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such CashCashPinoy Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with CashCashPinoy, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the CashCashPinoy Merchant, and the actions of the CashCashPinoy Merchant are not in our control.<br> <br>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card or any other types of payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies (“Affiliates”) with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage CashCashPinoy Merchants and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.<br> <br>We may remarket your information. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your past interactions with the CashCashPinoy website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by CashCashPinoy to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show CashCashPinoy ads on sites on the internet. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to CashCashPinoy's website. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.<br> <br>We may share your information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.<br> <br>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.<br> <br><br><h4>4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4><br>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers.
