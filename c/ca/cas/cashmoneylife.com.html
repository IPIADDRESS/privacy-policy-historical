<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Ryan Guina and I am the primary author  and editor of Cash Money Life (I used to <a title="should you use a pseudonym for blogging?" href="http://cashmoneylife.com/should-you-blog-anonymously/">blog under the name Patrick</a>). I am a writer, small business owner, entrepreneur, and professional in the corporate world. I have been married for 3 years and we have a beautiful newborn girl. I served a tour in the US Air Force, and I also run a military money website – <a href="http://themilitarywallet.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Military Wallet</strong></a>. My wife and I live in the Mid-West and plan on being here for a few more years. In the meantime, we continue to enjoy our current life while planning our future.</p>
<p>I wish you all well on your personal journey to financial freedom and happiness!</p>
<p>~ Ryan Guina</p>
