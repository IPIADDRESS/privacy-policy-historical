                                The use of " Cookies" is an industry 
                                standard that refers to pieces of information 
                                that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard 
                                disk for record keeping purposes. By storing information 
                                about your preferences on a particular site, many 
                                major Web sites use cookies to provide useful 
                                features for their customers. In our case we use 
                                "Cookies" to maintain session information 
                                for logged in members and to prevent the need 
                                for re-entry of login information. The "Cookies" 
                                used by CashEdge are present only when you are 
                                in session- they are deleted when you log off. 
                                CashEdge does not use "persistent" cookies 
                                (that is, cookies that remain after you log off)
