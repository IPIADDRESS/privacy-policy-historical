            <p>
                Effective: July 2, 2013

            <p>
                We respect your privacy and consider protecting it a serious goal.  In the course of using Casetext,
                you may provide us with personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify
                you, with contributions to our website, and with information on your activities at our website.
                This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information; the policy
                applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by J2H2, Inc., which owns and operates
                Casetext.  You accept the terms and conditions of this privacy policy when you accept our
                <a href="/terms">Terms</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>
                If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the “Last
                updated” date above.
            </p>
            <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
            <p>
                We collect information that you provide or that is collected automatically when you use Casetext.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use that information in a number of ways:
            </p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li>(a) to deliver the services you request,</li>
                <li>(b) to improve our website, services, features, and content,</li>
                <li>(c) to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our website,</li>
                <li>(d) to personalize your experience, including by using location-based information,</li>
                <li>(e) to provide or offer updates and announcements,</li>
                <li>(f) to provide you with further information and offers from us or third parties that we believe you
                may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing, or promotional materials and other
                information on services and products offered by us or third parties,</li>
                <li>(g) to monitor and analyze use of our website and our services,</li>
                <li>(h) to administer our website,</li>
                <li>(i) to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics,
                and website use behavior of our users, and</li>
                <li>(j) to verify that visitors to our website meet the criteria required to process their requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to compile and share aggregated information about our users, transactions
                completed using our service, sales, and traffic, though we will not share this information in a
                manner that permits the identification of a specific user without prior permission from that user.
            </p>
            <h5>Content Provided by You</h5>
            <p>
                When you contribute to Casetext, the content you post and metadata about that content (such as the time
                you posted the content) will be viewable by the public, along with your name.  This
                information will be searchable online and may be reused or modified elsewhere.  Please see our
                <a href="/terms">Terms</a>—particularly the section on <a href="/terms#subscriber_content">
                Subscriber Content</a>—for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may aggregate and display information about your publicly viewable activities on Casetext in your
                profile, which is also viewable by the public.  For example, your profile may include a list of the
                tags, analysis, related materials, and other annotations that you have contributed.
            </p>

            <h5>Other Information Provided by You</h5>
            <p>
                When you register for an account, add profile information, or purchase any product or service from us,
                you give us personal information.  For example, we may collect and store your name, phone number,
                credit card or other billing information, email, and postal address.  If you use a social networking
                website (such as Google+, LinkedIn, or Facebook) to sign in, we will also collect and store your user ID
                for that social network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your name and the information you add to your profile will be viewable by the public.
                You can review or request changes to this information by logging into your account at
                <a href="http://www.casetext.com/">www.casetext.com</a> or by contacting us at

                We may contact you using the email you provide, and if you correspond with us by email, we may keep
                records of those email conversations.  We will generally send you messages that relate to transactions
                you conduct on our website or that have important alerts and notices about your account
                or our services.  You cannot opt out of these communications.  Additionally, we may send you other
                communications such as (a) notices about your use of our services, including notices regarding
                violations of our terms of service, (b) updates to our website and services, and (c) promotional
                information regarding our services.  You can opt out of receiving promotional emails by contacting us

            <h5>Information Collected Automatically</h5>
            <p>
                Cookies and web beacons are small files that enable us to capture and remember certain information.
                We use cookies and web beacons to enable certain features of our website, to understand and save
                your preferences for future visits, and to compile aggregate data about user traffic and behavior so
                that we can offer better experiences and tools in the future. We also may use other technologies
                for these purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our website
                visitors.  We may also allow third-party advertisers to serve advertisements on our website or
                otherwise tied to our services.  These third parties may also use technologies like
                cookies to collect information, and we do not control their use of these technologies.  You can
                configure your software so it does not accept cookies, though you may not be able to access certain
                portions or features of our website.
            </p>
            <h4>Protection of Your Information</h4>

                levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information,
                and we cannot guarantee that such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed
                by a breach of our safeguards.
            </p>
            <h4>Disclosure to Third Parties</h4>
            <p>

                that you store using our services to a third party as outlined in this privacy policy, as required
                by law, or with your consent.  We may share your information with trusted third parties that assist us
                in operating our website, conducting and improving our business, or providing services for you, in
                which case we will provide access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks.
                Additionally, we may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your
                information, in connection with a corporate transaction such as a merger, acquisition,
                reorganization, or sale of assets.  In any such event, you will receive notice if your data is
                transferred and becomes subject to a substantially different privacy policy.  We may also release
                your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce
                our policies, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. Non-personally identifiable
                information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
