<li>How users navigate through the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>No attempts are made to identify anyone browsing our site. The data is captured so that we can accurately evaluate the quality of our content and make improvements for you.</p>


<p>In some areas of the site we use technology called cookies when you visit our site. Cookies are small pieces of information which can be stored on your hard drive or in memory. They can record information about your visit to the site, allowing it to remember you next time you visit and provide a more meaningful experience. </p>

<p>The cookies we send to your PC cannot read your hard drive, obtain any information from your browser or command your computer to perform any action. They cannot be sent to another site or be retrieved by any site other than CASA.</p>

<h2>How we use your information</h2>
<p>The type of information we collect from you will depend on what online services you use. When you subscribe to a mailing list, we will only use your e-mail address to send information on the topics you nominated. We will not use this information for any other purpose.</p>

<p>When responding to items displayed in our web site we may request (for example, in an order form), and you may provide personal information such as your name and address, email address and contact phone numbers. In the forms we will usually tell you how we use the personal information we collect, who we give access to that information and how you can access it, if we have retained it. </p>
<p>We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message or enter it into a form on our site. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent. </p>
<p>When you subscribe to a mailing list, we will only use your e-mail address to send information on the topics you nominated. We will not use this information for any other purpose.
