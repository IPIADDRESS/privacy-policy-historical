All information collected by the Casale Media Online Advertising Network (MediaNet) is not personally identifiable as it relates to consumers. <br><br><strong>Cookies <br></strong>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. <br><br>The Casale Media Online Advertising Network (MediaNet) uses cookies for the purpose of tracking when an Internet user has seen an advertisement. These cookies do not and cannot provide Casale Media with any personally identifiable information about an Internet user. These cookies serve two purposes: <ol><li>They are used to inform the Casale Media Online Advertising Network (MediaNet) whether or not an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served. These cookies are not used by Casale Media to build a profile of a user's behaviour nor are they used by Casale Media for the purposes of behavioural tracking or behavioural targeting. </li><li>They are used to facilitate retargeting at a campaign level. Retargeting is the process of serving an ad from a particular advertiser to a user, based on the fact that the user has previously visited the advertiser's website. Retargeting occurs within the confines of a user-to-advertiser relationship, and is not available for general targeting on the network. Retargeting is not available for sensitive health-related topics. </li></ol><p><strong>Third Party Data<br></strong>Casale Media may obtain data from third party companies for the purpose of informing ad selection. This data is supplied in aggregate form and does not include any personally identifiable information (PII). </p><p><strong>Opt-Out<br></strong>Casale Media is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. To learn more or to opt out of targeted advertising from Casale Media and other NAI member networks, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="New">click here</a>.</p><p><strong>Collection and Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br></strong>All information shared with both advertisers and publishers within the Casale Media online advertising network (MediaNet) is done so in an aggregate fashion. This allows us to provide clients of the advertising network with broad percentages regarding the users who are receiving advertisements through the network. This data is not linked to any form of personally identifiable information.</p><p><strong>Data Retention<br></strong>The unique user identification number, associated with when and how many times an individual has seen an advertisement, is deleted after 90 days of user inactivity. These unique IDs are not tied to any personally identifiable information. Aggregated statistical information, such as the popularity of an advertiser campaign, will be retained as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><p>Log files are created to analyze trends, keep track of user movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. Log file data may be retained for up to a maximum period of fifteen months.</p><p><strong>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information by Advertisers<br></strong>Advertisers who are clients of Casale Media may collect personally identifiable information on their own websites. These details provided directly by the individual Internet user in the form of online order forms, contests, or otherwise through the advertiser's website, are not visible to Casale Media. This personally identifiable information collected by the advertiser is subject to the privacy policy of the individual advertiser involved. </p><p><strong>Online Behavioral Advertising<br></strong>Casale Media adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="new">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>.</p><p>The Casale Media Online Advertising Network prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users.
