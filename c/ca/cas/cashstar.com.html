<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<section class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody">
	<p>CashStar, Inc. ("CashStar") is committed to maintaining the privacy of those that use our services. We created the following policy guidelines to explain how CashStar collects and uses the data you provide to CashStar and our clients when you visit this site and the gift card sites we operate for each of our clients (collectively, "Sites"). &nbsp;<br>Please read this Privacy Policy closely. By visiting the Sites and/or providing your personal information to CashStar, you agree that CashStar may collect, use, and disclose your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, our clients have a privacy policy that explains how they use the data you provide to CashStar. Please refer to the appropriate policy when you are interested in how your data is used for each program. We routinely update this Privacy Policy as our products and offerings change, so check back regularly for updates or changes.</p>
	<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Information CashStar Collects</span></strong></p>
	<p>CashStar collects information when you use the Sites and interact with CashStar. For example, we collect data when you purchase an eGift Card or Plastic Gift Card (collectively "Gift Card"), if you contact Customer Support, or if you participate in certain offers and promotions. We only collect as much information as we need for specific, identified purposes.</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><strong>Personal Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you purchase a Gift Card on the Sites, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, credit card payment information, billing address, and home/mobile telephone number. This information is collected to enable CashStar to process your order. We do not retain your entire credit card number and only store what is necessary for us to process your order and verify it in the future.</li>
		<li><strong>Cookies Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies (a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer. CashStar uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. These persistent cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different. Please review your browser's "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies setup. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</li>
		<li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you use the Sites or open one of our emails, we automatically record certain data using technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons," cookies (discussed above), IP addresses, and unique "device IDs" (similar to IP addresses). "Automatically collected" data includes web browser type, the website that referred you to us, the web pages you viewed on the Sites, and the dates and times that you visited the Sites.</li>
		<li><strong>Client Provided Information:</strong>&nbsp;When CashStar manages promotions or other services for a client (a company or organization to which CashStar provides business services) a unique identifier is shared with CashStar in order to process the Gift Card generation and redemption activity on behalf of that Client. CashStar does not receive any personally identifiable information from these unique identifiers, which are used solely to process the promotional activity.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Way CashStar Uses Information</span></strong></p>
