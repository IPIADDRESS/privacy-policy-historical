</p><h2>Data automatically collected </h2><p>
We log visitor’s domain and IP address automatically; this information does not identify you as an individual, but only the computer that is being used to view the website. This data is used to see where the website is being used in the world to ensure coverage, and for click stream analysis to help better understand site usage, so that we can improve our service to you. We do not link information automatically logged by such means with personal data about specific individuals. <br>
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer as a result of visiting a web site. This allows the site to know that you have visited before and in some cases can be used to record your preferences.
</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>

There are two types of cookies used on this website:

In a few cases blocking cookies may reduce the functionality of some sites or prevent access to them depending on your chosen browser options. </p>

<p>Cookies can also easily be deleted through your specific internet browser, although this means your settings will not be retained. </p>
