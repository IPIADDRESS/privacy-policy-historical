							<ul>
								<li>What is “Personal Information”?
<br>
Personal Information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual. We gather the information, either independently or through the help of third party service providers, as detailed below.</li>
								<li>Types of Personal Information we collect from or about you
<ul>
										<li><strong>Registration details</strong>: When you open an account and register to use the Services, you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself, such as: first and last name, email address, full name and gender, birth data, physical address, ID number, phone number, etc.</li>

										<li><strong>Device information</strong>: We may collect specific types of connection details and information with regard to your device, software or hardware that may identify you, such as: device’s unique identifiers (e.g. UDID, MAC address), browser fingerprinting, IP address and geo-location data.</li>
										<li><strong>Social networks</strong>: When you register through your social network account (such as your Facebook account), to use the Services or connect your player account with such account, we will have access to basic information from your social network account, such as your name, birthdate, profile picture and friends' list, as well as information you made publicly available on such account.

									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Non-personal Information</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>What is “Non-personal Information”?
<br>
Non-personal Information is non-identifiable information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. As such, we are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected. We use such information for different purposes, such as advertising, improvement of the Services, preventing fraud and performing web analytics. We may gather such information, either independently or through the help of our third party service providers and the White Label Brand (if applicable).</li>

										<li><strong>Gameplay information</strong>: We record game play information including, amongst other things, your deposits, bets, bonuses, game session duration and your high scores. We may also share and publish such information through any of our Platforms.</li>
										<li><strong>Device and connection information</strong>: If you download the Software to your device, we may collect information from the particular device you are using, for security and fraud detection and prevention purposes. For example, we may gather information with regard to other software which is running simultaneously with the Software for detecting if you are using software which is associated with fraudulent activity (e.g. robots, malware, etc.) or checking if the connection you are using is via a VPN or proxy.</li>
										<li><strong>Analytics information</strong>: We collect information about your use of the Services, such as applications' usage, log files, user activity (e.g. pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, online browsing, clicks, actions, etc.), time stamps, alerts, etc. This information is collected for amongst other things troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services.</li>
										<li><strong>Anonymous information</strong>: We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose, such as for advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
										<li><strong>Data combination</strong>: If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information or anonymous information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</li>
