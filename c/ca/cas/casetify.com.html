In particular, if you are located in a jurisdiction outside the United States, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to our servers and computer systems anywhere in the world, including to countries that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home jurisdiction. If you provide any Personal Information that relates to another person you hereby state and agree that you have obtained proper consent from such person for the use, disclosure, and processing of such Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                            <p>The site actively collects Personal Information from you when you register with the site, when you send any e-mail to the site administrator, and when you submit any information to the site. The kinds of Personal Information you may provide include your name, contact information including e-mail address, user ID, and other information that you include in any communication or submission. We may use this Personal Information to register you with the site, to respond to your inquiry or the issue you pose to the site administrator, to post your submissions to the site and to provide information to others regarding your use of the site. We may also use Personal Information to notify you about products and services that may be of interest to you. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.

                            <p>The site may passively collect certain kinds of information that reveal the frequency with which you visit the site, the times and dates of your visits, the pages you reviewed, persons with whom you interact and other information. Information is passively collected through various means. We use Internet protocol (IP) addresses to administer the site. We use navigational data, including log files and transmission data, to identify information about your web browser and operating system, the time period in which you visit the site or a portion of the site and other the site members with whom you collaborate. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. This information is used to administer the site, report usage metrics and otherwise operate and improve the site content.</p>
                            <p>Like many Internet sites, the site may use small text files called "cookies" that are sent to the hard drive of your computer to store bits of information related to your use of the site. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, and passwords needed to access the site. The 'Help' section of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to configure your browser to reject cookies altogether. However, if you disable cookies, you might not be able to access important functions or features of the site and your use of the site may be limited. The site combines passively collected information (as described above) with actively collected Personal Information and information may be recorded as part of your profile. We do record and use personal information provided by you in order to process orders on the site and provide customer service. This can include name, address information, shipping information and contact information you enter in the shopping cart. This information is used in conjunction with processing, shipping and fulfilling orders through the website.</p>
                            <p>We may disclose Personal Information to third party service providers performing services on our behalf, including those hosting our servers and providing other technical support services. We use third parties such as a payment processor to bill you for products and a shipping company to ship your order. When you purchase a product, we will share your name, address, credit card details, purchase amount as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Credit card information is transmitted over a secure SSL-encrypted connection to our payment processor and stored in a PCI Level 1-compliant datacenter until the transaction is completed, at which point it is removed entirely unless you have requested to store your credit card details securely at the processor for future transactions. No credit card information is stored on our server. When shipping an order, your contact information is passed to our shipping partner for the purpose of calculating postage, purchasing a shipping label, and tracking shipments. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. All such parties will be under obligation to comply with privacy terms substantially similar to this Privacy Policy, and to process data in accordance with our instructions.</p>
