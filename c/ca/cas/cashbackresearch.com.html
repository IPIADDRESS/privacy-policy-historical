<br>
It also tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.<br>
<br>
It is important that you read this privacy policy, together with any other 
privacy policies we may provide, so that you are fully aware of how and why we 
are using your data.<br>
<br>
This privacy policy was last updated on 25th of May 2018.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, or would like to exercise your privacy rights, please 
follow the instructions in this privacy policy. See How to contact 
Cashbackresearch.com about privacy below.<br>
<br>
2. Cashbackresearch.com’s Websites<br>

sailing certification course packages, team building and special sailing 
activities, Colgate Sailing Adventures, and Colgate 26 sailboats which are aimed

<br>
Cashbackresearch.com is one legal entity:<br>
<br>
Cashbackresearch.com Ltd., Inc. located at PO Box 7344, Myrtle Beach, SC 29572.<br>
Cashbackresearch.com is the data controller responsible for this website and any 
handling of personal data carried out by or on behalf of the company.<br>
<br>
3, Personal Data Which We Collect About You<br>
Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an 
individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data 
where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).<br>
<br>
We collect a variety of information about our customers and visitors to 
Cashbackresearch.com’s websites. This personal data falls into these categories:<br>
<br>
Identity Data includes title, first name, last name. If you interact with us 
through social media, this may include your social media user name.<br>
<br>
Contact Data includes billing address, delivery address, email address and 
telephone numbers.<br>
<br>
Profile Data includes preferences, feedback and survey responses.<br>
<br>
Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and 
version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, 
operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to 
access websites.<br>
<br>
Usage Data includes information about how you use our websites, products and 
services.<br>
<br>
Tracking Data includes information we or others collect about you from cookies 
and similar tracking technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile 
identifiers.<br>
<br>
Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in receiving direct 
marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.<br>
<br>
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or 
demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your 
personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not 
directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your 
Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website 
feature. To provide better content and service, Cashbackresearch.com’s website 
uses the Google web analytics service. Google Analytics does not track your 
browsing habits across other third-party websites and all information about you 
which reaches google analytics. Please see Google Analytics’ privacy policy.<br>
<br>
However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so 
that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as 
personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.<br>
<br>
Remember, if you choose not to share personal data with us, or refuse certain 
contact permissions, we might not be able to provide the surveys you’ve asked 
for.<br>
<br>
4. How is Your Personal Data Collected?<br>
We use different methods to collect data from and about you, including through:<br>
<br>
Direct interactions. You may give us your Identity, Contact and Financial Data 
by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or through 
chat or social media.<br>
<br>
This includes personal data you provide when you:<br>
<br>
Sign up to receive Cashbackresearch.com’s newsletter;<br>
Make inquiries or request information be sent to you;<br>
Take surveys;<br>
Ask that marketing messages and material are sent to you;<br>
Engage with us on social media;<br>
Enter a competition, promotion or survey;<br>
Contact sales, marketing, operations, financial, management, customer services; 
or<br>
Leave comments or reviews on our services.<br>
Automated technologies or interactions. As you interact with us, including via 
the websites, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, 
browsing actions and patterns. We may also collect Tracking Data when you use 
our website, or when you click on one of our advertisements (including those 
shown on third party websites).<br>
<br>
Third parties or publicly available sources. We may receive personal data about 
you from various types of third parties, including:<br>
<br>
Technical Data and/or Tracking Data from analytics providers, advertising 
networks and search information providers;<br>
Contact, Financial and Transaction Data from providers of payment and fraud 
prevention services;<br>
Identity and Contact Data from data partners; and<br>
Data from any third parties who are permitted by law or have your permission to 
share your personal data with us, such as via social media or review sites. We 
will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we 
will use your personal data in the following circumstances.<br>
5. How We Use Your Personal Data<br>
Where we need to perform the contract Terms &amp; Conditions we are about to enter 
into or have entered into with you. For example, when you purchase our products, 
that’s a contract.<br>
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) 
and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. For 
example, when we carry out fraud screening as part of the registration proces.<br>
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. For example, 
keeping records of our sales for tax compliance.<br>
Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your 
personal data other than where the law requires it, for example in relation to 
sending certain direct marketing communications. Where our legal basis is 
consent, you have the right to withdraw consent any time.<br>
<br>
See Explaining the legal bases we rely on to process personal data to find out 
more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your 
personal data.<br>
<br>
7. Advertising, Marketing and Your Communications Preferences<br>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Tracking, Usage and Profile Data 
to form a picture of what we think you may want or need, or what may be of 
interest to you. This is how we decide which surveys and offers may be relevant 
for you and tell you about them. This is what we call direct marketing.<br>
<br>
We may carry out direct marketing by email, dashboard display or push 
notification. <br>
<br>
On our websites, we always try hard to make it really clear what we are doing 
and what communications you will be sent, whether it’s you deciding to sign up 
for Cashbackresearch.com or newsletters or as part of the survey-taking process. 
You have a right at any time to change your mind and say no thank you and opt 
out of our communications. The easiest way to opt out is to use the unsubscribe 
link at the bottom of the communication.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are lots of different ways you’ll see advertisements for 
Cashbackresearch.com and Colgate 26, and not all of these are based on using 
personal data – sometimes we just buy advertising space in different mediums, 
and websites and social media. If you see Cashbackresearch.com’s advertisements 
on websites and in social media, these may not be directed specifically at you, 
we might have bid for the space. <br>
<br>
We also work with partners to try and promote the reach of our advertisements 
and use analytics and retargeting for this reason. We use Tracking Data to 
deliver relevant online advertising, including via websites and social media.<br>
<br>
Tracking Data, and in particular cookies, help us to deliver website and social 
advertising that we believe is most relevant to you and to potential new 
customers of Cashbackresearch.com. The cookies used for this purpose are often 
placed on our website by specialist organizations – and this is why you might 
see our website ads again. This includes retargeting.<br>
<br>
Cookies can also tell us if you have seen a specific advertisement, and how long 
it has been since you have seen it. This is helpful, because it means we can 
control the effectiveness of our advertisements and control the number of times 
people might be shown our advertisements). Cookies also help us understand if 
you’ve opened a marketing email because we don’t want to send you things you 
don’t read.<br>
<br>
If you want more information about Tracking Data, in particular cookies, see 
Cookies below.<br>
<br>
Almost all the cookies that relate to advertising are part of third party online 
advertising networks. If you’d like to read about how you can control which 
advertisements you see online, see opt-out programs established by the Digital 
Advertising Alliance (United States), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada 
and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. We do not control 
cookies which are set by advertising networks.<br>
<br>
8. Cookies<br>
You can see from Advertising, marketing and your communications preferences 
above, that cookies are a tool which we (and everyone else who operates online) 
uses for advertising. That is just part of why cookies are used.<br>
<br>
Cookies help Cashbackresearch.com work better and provide lots of help in the 
background to make the process of being an Cashbackresearch.com subscriber 
easier.<br>
<br>
Other cookies collect information about how visitors use Cashbackresearch.com, 
for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error 
messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies 
a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and used to 
improve how cashbackresearch.com works.<br>
<br>
There are also cookies that allow cashbackresearch.com to remember choices you 
make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide 
enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember 
changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you 
can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such 
as watching a video or commenting on a blog.<br>
<br>
There are cookies that collect information about your browsing habits in order 
to make advertising delivered to you more relevant to you and your interests 
(see Advertising, marketing and your communications preferences above). They are 
usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that 
you have visited a website and this information is shared with other 
organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies 
will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.<br>
<br>
When you use cashbackresearch.com, your device or browser may be sent cookies 
from third parties, for example when using embedded content and social network 
links. It’s important for you to know that we have no access to or control over 
cookies used by these companies or third-party websites. We suggest you check 
the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to 
manage them.<br>
<br>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you 
when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please 
note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function 
properly.<br>

about you that may be incomplete or inaccurate;<br>

The right to restrict processing – that’s a right for you in certain 
circumstances to ask us to suspend processing personal data;<br>

comply with your request in these circumstances.<br>
<br>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your

updated.<br>
