      Castin.tv Account. You can also contact us about a particular video 
      without having a Castin.tv Account.<br>
      * Account-Related Activity. Certain other activities on Castin.tvâ€”like 
      uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos require you to have a 
      Castin.tv Account. We ask for some personal information when you create a 
      Castin.tv Account, including your email address and a password, which is 
      used to protect your account from unauthorized access.<br>
      * Usage Information. We may record information about your usage, such as 
      when you use Castin.tv, the channels, groups, and favorites you subscribe 
      to, the contacts you communicate with, the videos you watch, and the 
      frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display 
      or click on in Castin.tv (including UI elements, settings, and other 
      information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with 
      your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based 
      emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.<br>
      * Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or video content that 
      you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and 
      chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly 
      available and can be collected and used by others.<br>
      <br>
      <u><b>Uses</b></u><br>

      improve the quality and design of the Castin.tv and to create new 
      features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, 
      analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user 
      activity and communications.<br>
      * We use cookies, and log file information to: (a) store information so 
      that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time 
      you visit the Castin.tv; (b) provide custom, personalized content and

      <u><b>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites<br>
      </b></u><br>
      Castin.tv allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad 
      networks, to serve advertisements within the Castin.tv. These third-party 
      ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your 
      browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Castin.tv. They 
      automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use 
      other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to 
      measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the 
      advertising content you see.<br>
      <br>
      Castin.tv does not provide any personally identifiable information to 
      these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except 
      as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the 
      ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser 
      asks Castin.tv to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for 
      example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 
      who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that 
      advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the 
      description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may 
      also use information regarding your use of the Castin.tv, such as the 
      number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable 
      information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.<br>
      <br>
      You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad 
      servers or ad networks (i.e Adsense , Adbrite) for more information on 
      their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain 
      practices. Castin.tv's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot 
      control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data 
      obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with Castin.tv is 
      maintained and dealt with by Castin.tv in accordance with this privacy 
      policy.</font></td>
