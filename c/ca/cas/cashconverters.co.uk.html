The agencies will record details of the search type, credit or identification, whether or not this application proceeds. We may use credit-scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. We may also contact your employer to verify your employment status. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us and other companies if credit decisions are made about you, or other members of your household. Any of this information may also be used for identification purposes, debt tracing, debt recovery and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account.</p>
<p>For certain products, we may make periodic searches of credit reference agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we may give details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on-time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt. Please see Part 2 of this privacy policy for further details.<br>
We will retain information on unsuccessful or aborted applications for our products and services for up to six years following the application.</p>

<h4>Will my personal information be transferred abroad?</h4>
<p>The personal information you provide to us is processed in the UK. It may be transferred to other group companies and to franchisees as described in previous paragraphs.

<h3>PART 2: CREDIT REFERENCING</h3>
<h4>General Information</h4>
<p>If you apply for a loan from us, we will perform searches with credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt.</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent before passing details about you to any credit reference agencies. If you no not give us your consent, we will not proceed with your application.</p>
<p>The information below tells you about how credit reference agencies, Cash Converters<br>
and other lenders use your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>What is a credit reference agency?</strong><br>
Credit reference agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information on consumers’ and businesses’ credit behaviour, on behalf of lenders in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>What is a fraud prevention agency?</strong><br>
Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) collect, maintain and share information on known and suspected fraudulent activity. Some CRAs also act as FPAs.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you use them when I have applied to you?</strong><br>
Although you have applied to us and we will check our own records, we will also contact CRAs to get information on your credit behaviour with other organisations. This will help us make the best possible assessment of your overall situation before we make a decision.</p>
<p><strong>Where do they get information from?</strong><br>
Publicly available information sources such as</p>
<ul>
<li>The Electoral Register at Local Authorities</li>
<li>County Court Judgments from Registry Trust</li>
<li>Bankruptcy information from the Insolvency Service</li>
<li>Fraud information from fraud prevention agencies</li>
<li>Credit information comes from information on applications to banks, building societies and credit card companies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will I know if my Personal Information is sent to a CRA or FPA?</strong><br>
You will be told when you apply for a loan if your data will be supplied. The next section tells you how, when and why we will search at CRAs and what we will do with the information we obtain from them. We will also tell you if we plan to send payment history information on you, if you have one, to CRAs. You can ask at any time for the name of the CRAs and FPAs we use.</p>
<p><strong>Why is my Personal Information used in this way?</strong><br>
We and other organisations want to make the best possible decisions we can, in order to make sure that you will be able to repay us. Some organisations may also use the information to check your identity. In this way we can ensure we all make responsible decisions. At the same time we also want to make decisions quickly and easily and, by using up to date information, provided electronically, we are able to make the most reliable and fair decisions possible.</p>
<p><strong>Who controls what CRAs can do with my Personal Information?</strong><br>
All organisations that collect and process personal data are regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998, overseen by Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). All credit reference agencies are in regular dialogue with the ICO. Use of the Electoral Register is controlled under the Representation of the People Act 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Can just anyone see my Personal Information held at CRAs?</strong><br>
No, access to your information is very strictly controlled and only those that are entitled to do so may see it. Usually that will only be with your agreement or if there is a legal requirement to do so.</p>
<h4>Applying to us for a loan</h4>
<p>We will search at credit reference agencies and at fraud prevention agencies for information on you and we will send the information you supply to us as part of the loan application to the credit reference agencies.</p>
<p>If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may also pass this information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect us, them and our respective customers from theft and fraud.</p>
<p>With the information we obtain from the credit reference agencies we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess your application for credit</li>
<li>verify your identity</li>
<li>undertake checks for the prevention and detection of fraud and money laundering</li>
<li>undertake periodic statistical analysis or testing to ensure the accuracy of existing and future products and services</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. Any or all of these processes may be automated.</p>
<h4>After you have a loan from us</h4>
<p>Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we will give certain Personal Information about you to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we will tell credit reference agencies. We may make periodic searches of our records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your loan with us, to take decisions regarding your identity and also credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit.</p>
<p>If you have borrowed from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover payment. To help us do this, we may share your Personal Information with third parties who assist us with tracing, debt collection and debt enforcement.</p>
<h4>About Credit Reference Agencies</h4>
<p>When credit reference agencies receive a search from us they will place a search ‘footprint’ on your credit file whether or not this application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search (but not the name of the organisation that carried it out) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future.</p>
<p>The credit reference agencies will also supply us with:</p>
<ul>
<li>credit information such as previous applications</li>
<li>public information such as County Court Judgments and bankruptcies</li>
<li>electoral register information</li>
<li>fraud prevention information</li>
</ul>
<p>If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, credit reference agencies will record the outstanding debt. Records shared with credit reference agencies remain on file for 6 years after they are closed whether settled by you or defaulted.</p>
<h4>How credit reference agencies use your Personal Information</h4>
<p>The information which we, other organisations and fraud prevention agencies provide to the credit reference agencies about you may be supplied by credit reference agencies to other organisations and used by them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make decisions on credit</li>
<li>trace your whereabouts and recover payment if you do not make payments you owe</li>
<li>conduct checks for the prevention and detection of crime including fraud and money laundering</li>
<li>undertake statistical analysis and system testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998. Your data may also be used to offer you other products.</p>
<p>Credit references agencies will <strong>NOT</strong> use your Personal Information to create a blacklist or to make a decision.</p>
<h4>Find out more</h4>
<p>You can contact the 3 credit referencing agencies currently operating in the UK. They will charge you a small statutory fee for giving you a copy of your credit record.</p>
<ul>
<li>CallCredit, Consumer Services Team, PO Box 491, Leeds, LS3 1WZ or call 0870 0601414</li>
<li>Equifax PLC, Credit File Advice Centre, PO Box 3001, Bradford, BD1 5US or call 0870 010 0583 or log on to www.myequifax.co.uk</li>
<li>Experian, Consumer Help Service, PO Box 8000, Nottingham NG80 7WF or call 0870 241 6212 or log on to www.experian.co.uk</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been refused credit you can get advice from your local Trading Standards Department, Citizens Advice Bureau or Consumer Advice Centre and the agencies’ web sites. The Information Commissioner also produces a useful leaflet entitled ‘Credit Explained’. You can obtain a free copy on the Commissioner’s website (www.ico.gov.uk) or by telephoning 0870 600 8100.</p>
<h4>Fraud Prevention Agencies</h4>
<p>We have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those responsible. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>We and other organisations may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.</p>
