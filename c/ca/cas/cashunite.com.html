<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
 This site (the "Site") is owned by CashUnite, a United Kingdom limited liability company ("us," "we," or "Company"). We created this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain how we use the information we collect on the Site. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. 
 </p><p>
<strong>Information We Collect:</strong>
<br>
We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site: <br>1) IP addresses; <br>2) domain servers; <br>3) types of computers accessing the Site; 
and <br>4) types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively "Traffic Data").<br> Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes and for improving your experience on the Site. We also use "cookies" to customize content specific to your interests, where such instances of cookie use will better your user experience, we will prompt you initially for authorisation.

Our Site provides a broad range of Social Media services and tools for you to use for a variety of exposure and interaction purposes (collectively, the "Social Media Tools"). In order for us to be able to contact you about your use of the Site and Social Media Tools, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). 
Personal Information includes the following categories of information: 
1) Contact Data (such as your name, company name, contact information, telephone number, email address, and login name); 
2) Financial Data (such as the credit/debit account information for the account you want to establish for billing purposes); and 
3) Transaction Data (for example, the name of the person who referred you to us, the names and contact information for people you refer to us, data about specific marketing campaigns and results, consumer contact information such as email addresses and phone numbers, and related marketing materials). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our blogs, chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. 
</p><p>
<strong>How your Personal Information is Used:</strong>
<br>
 We use Personal Information in the following ways: 
 <br>
 1) to enable you to use our Social Site and Viral Broadcasting Tools; 
  <br>
 2) to contact you about our Site, Social Media Tools, and other related products and services in which we think you may be interested; and 
  <br>
 3) to customize and tailor your experience on our Site. 

We do not sell, license, transfer, and/or share the billing information we collect from you, other than for billing purposes. We use an unaffiliated, credit card processing company to process your payments. We transfer your payment information—and you authorise us to do so, with this company, solely for this purpose.
