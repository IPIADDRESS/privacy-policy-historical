<br><br>

<b>Collection of Information is Required by Law to Verify Customers</b>
<br><br>

<b>1.</b> All transactions processed by CashX are subject to the regulations governing the jurisdiction in which the transaction is processed, such as the Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the regulations supervised by the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FINCEN) of the United States Department of the Treasury. CashX must adhere to the defined KYC requirements of these regulations.
<br><br>

<b>2.</b> When a Customer uses CashX's Services via their online bank, CashX relies upon the bank to validate the Customer via passwords, PINs and dynamic tokens as the Customer interacts with the bank's online service.
<br><br>
<b>3.</b> It is CashX's responsibility to verify the identity of the Customer prior to using the CashX Services so that the following standards are met. CashX should obtain the following information in relation to the Customer:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Full Name
</li><li>Residential Address
</li><li>Citizenship
</li></ul>

<b>4.</b> Verification of the information obtained should be conducted EITHER electronically by CashX OR based on documentary evidence provided by the customer, OR by a combination of both electronic and documentary methods.
<br><br>

<b>5.</b> If identity is submitted electronically, this will be verified by our CashX Verification Department, using as its basis the customer's full name, address and date of birth, carrying out electronic checks either using our own in-house information, or through a supplier that provides a reasonable assurance that the customer has provided their true identity. The standard level of ID verification is:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>one match on an individual's full name and current address; and
</li><li>a second match on an individual's full name and either their current address or their date of birth.
</li></ul>

Acceptable documents for ID verification that you may scan and submitt to us are as follows:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Valid Passport;
</li><li>Valid Photo Card Driving License;
</li><li>National Identity Card;
</li><li>Identity Card issued by the Electoral Office
</li><li>Valid (old style) Drivers License (no photograph);
</li><li>Recent evidence of entitlement to a state or local authority funded benefit (including housing benefit and council tax benefit), tax credit, pension and educational or other grant;
</li><li>Instrument of a court appointment (such as liquidator or grant of probate);
</li><li>Current council tax demand letter or statement;
</li><li>Current bank statements or credit/debit card statements issued by a regulated financial sector firm or comparable jurisdiction (but excluding any statement printed from the internet); and/or
</li><li>Utility bills.
</li></ul>
<br>
Please ensure that all four edges of the documents are visible when you upload your scanned documents into the system. The following file types can only be sent: jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp or png. Please ensure that these documents are clear and the name of your file does not contain special characters, spaces or non-English characters. CashX does not except faxed copies of photo identification for verification purposes.
<br><br>

<b>6.</b> If identity is to be verified manually by a CashX Agent, the identification should be based on either a Government issued document that incorporates the Customer's full name and photograph and either their residential address or their date of birth; OR a government-issued document (without a photograph) which incorporates the Customer's full name, supported by a second document, either government issued, or issued by a judicial authority or a public sector body or authority, which incorporates the Customer's full name and either their residential address or date of birth. Acceptable documents for ID verification are as follows:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Valid Passport;
</li><li>Valid Photo Card Driving License;
</li><li>National Identity Card;
</li><li>Identity Card issued by the Electoral Office
</li><li>Valid (old style) Drivers License (no photograph);
</li><li>Recent evidence of entitlement to a state or local authority funded benefit (including housing benefit and council tax benefit), tax credit, pension and educational or other grant;
</li><li>Instrument of a court appointment (such as liquidator or grant of probate);
</li><li>Current council tax demand letter or statement;
</li><li>Current bank statements or credit/debit card statements issued by a regulated financial sector firm or comparable jurisdiction (but excluding any statement printed from the internet); and/or
</li><li>Utility bills.
</li></ul>

<b>7.</b> Some Customers may not be able to produce identification information that will meet the required standard. Where an applicant produces non-standard documentation, a considered judgment should be made to determine if the evidence provides a sufficient level of confidence that the customer has provided adequate accurate information that authenticates their true identity.
<br><br>

<b>8.</b> When CashX has concluded that it should treat a Customer as financially excluded for the purposes of Customer identification, it should keep a record of the reasons for doing so. All records shall be maintained by CashX for at least five (5) years from the end of the business relationship with the Customer.
