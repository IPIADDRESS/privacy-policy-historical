	In the event that <strong>vital interests</strong> on your part or in the case of another natural person are interfered with which make a processing of personal data necessary, Article 6 (1) d) GDPR serves as the legal basis for this processing.<br>
	If processing is required to protect a <strong>legitimate interest</strong> of our company or of a third party and your interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not override our legitimate interest, Article 6 (1) f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.<br>
	We do not exercise any automated decision-taking in relation with the processing of personal data through the CASIO website.
</li>

<li><b>Storage period and erasure of data</b><br>
The personal data collected, processed and stored by us will essentially only be stored for such time as demanded by the concrete purpose of storage. If the purpose of storage/processing ceases to apply, i.e., when we no longer need to use your personal data to comply with contractual or statutory obligations, your data will be erased or anonymized. <br>
However, the situation may furthermore arise where European regulations, applicable national laws or other regulations (e.g. regulatory obligations) require that the data processed by us be retained for a longer period of time, e.g. statutory retention periods which can result from, e.g. Commercial Code, Tax Code and usually contain retention periods from 6 to 10 years, or if we need it to preserve evidence within the statutes of limitation, which is usually three years but can be up to thirty years. When these retention periods expire, we delete or anonymize your data. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<b>Your rights</b><br>
Insofar as we process your personal data, you are a "data subject" as contemplated by the GDPR. As a data subject, you may have the following rights in respect of CASIO. To exercise your rights please contact us as stated in Section 2.<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Right of access regarding processing</b><br>
You can within the framework of the statutory provision request from us information as to whether personal data are processed by us. If this is the case, you have the right to request information about the extent of the data processing. The access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right to obtain such copy.<br>
The right of access is limited pursuant to Section 34 FDPA. The right of access does e.g. not apply if the data (a) were recorded only because they may not be erased due to legal or statutory provisions on retention, or (b) only serve the purposes of monitoring data protection or safeguarding data, and providing information would require a disproportionate effort, and appropriate technical and organizational measures make processing for other purposes impossible.

</li>

<li><b>Right to rectification ("Right to be forgotten")</b><br>
You may have a right to have your data corrected by CASIO if the processed personal data concerning you are incorrect. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you may have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>

<li><b>Right to restriction of processing</b><br>
If the preconditions exist for this, you can request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. In this case, the respective data will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.</li>

<li><b>Right to erasure</b><br>
Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to obtain from us to erase of personal data concerning you and we may be obliged to erase such personal data. Such right to erasure does pursuant to Section 35 FDPA, for instance, not apply if in the case of a non-automated processing erasure would be impossible or would involve disproportionate effort due to the specific mode of storage and if your interest in erasure can be regarded as minimal. In such case, you may have the right to restriction of processing.</li>

<li><b>Right to data portability</b><br>
Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to CASIO in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Furthermore, you have the right to communicate these data to another controller without hindrance from CASIO provided the preconditions exist for this. </li>

<b>Right of objection </b><br>

The consequence of your an objection is that CASIO will no longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can demonstrate compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.<br>
In the event that we undertake marketing in respect of yourself, you have the right at any time to lodge an objection against the processing of the personal data concerning you for such promotional purposes. You can notify us of your objection using the following contact details:

<b>Dealer search</b><br>
On our CASIO website we offer you as a user the opportunity to search for the specialist dealer of our products who is nearest to your immediate location. For this purpose we collect from you your geo data; this involves you entering these data in a designated form (a) or clicking to allow your web browser to identify your location by means of IP address (b). To be able to display the right specialist dealer, CASIO uses the service Google Maps API, a map service operated by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google can be contacted at Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. In this way, we can display interactive maps directly in your web browser and enable you to use the map function conveniently.<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Collecting the data by form</b><br>
You have the opportunity on our CASIO website for the specialist-dealer search to complete a form in which you enter (optionally) the following details:<br>
<ul>
<li>Your country</li>
<li>Your postcode or your town/city</li>
<li>If necessary, street/road name</li>
</ul>
Then click on “Find dealer” and the specialist-dealer search is activated. In this way, Google receives the information that you have called up the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the following data are communicated to Google:<br>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>Date and time of the request</li>
<li>The time-zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</li>
<li>Contents of the request (concrete page)</li>
<li>Access status/HTTP status code</li>
<li>Data volume transmitted in each case</li>
<li>Website from which the request comes</li>
<li>Your browser type</li>
<li>Your operating system and its interface</li>
<li>Your language and version of the browser software</li>
</ul>

This takes place irrespective of whether Google provides a user account via which you are logged in or whether no user account exists at Google. When you are logged in to Google, your data are assigned directly to your account. If you do not want your data to be assigned with your profile at Google, you must log out from Google before visiting the CASIO website.<br> 
You have the opportunity to disable the Google Maps service in an easy way and thereby prevent data transfer to Google: To do so, disable JavaScript in your browser. However, we remind you that in this case you will not be able to use the map display.<br>
Google also processes your personal data in the USA and has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield for this purpose: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>.<br>
The use of Google Maps API is justified in accordance with Article 6 (1) Sentence 1 b) GDPR since the data in the present case are required to perform the contract. We use Google Maps API to be able to offer you a map function so that you find the right specialist dealer as quickly as possible.  If you consented to such processing, we use your browser data for the purpose of market and opinion research and optimization of our CASIO website as well as for personalizing your user experience with Google Analytics. The legal basis for the processing of your browser data is Article 6 (1) ( f) GDPR for the optimization of our CASIO website. We provide you with further information on the balancing test upon request.<br>
For further information on the purpose and extent of data collection and processing by Google, please refer to Google’s Data Privacy Policy. This also provides further information about your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy: <a href="http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>.
</li>
<li><b>Collecting the data via your web browser’s geo query</b><br>
CASIO sometimes uses websites which facilitate location-dependent browsing. It is therefore possible for your web browser, before you enter the data independently, already to ask whether our CASIO website is permitted to access your location. As soon as you permit your web browser to approve the website with an active click, the browser transmits data (degrees of longitude and latitude) to the Google location service to determine your approximate location. The browser then releases this information for the querying CASIO website so that CASIO can display the right specialist dealer for you.<br>
In view of data processing by Google, reference is made to Dealer search - Collecting the data by form above of this Data Privacy Policy.<br>
The legal basis for processing is in this case Article 6 (1) Sentence 1 b) GDPR.
