                <li>Casino Rewards reserves the right to ask Players for verification documents following deposits and/or prior to executing a withdrawal.</li>
                <li>Where it is required for any fraud or anti-money laundering investigations, the Casino may request additional information to ascertain the Player‚Äôs source of funds and/or wealth.</li>
                <li>
                    For verification purposes, Casino Rewards reserves the right to ask for a clear copy of (but is not limited to):
