<p><b><i>(Last updated August 26, 2010)</i></b></p>

<p>The Cash4Offers.com has developed the web technology to enable 
businesses to interact with consumers in highly personalized ways without forfeiting the privacy of the consumer. Privacy is a critical element of 
The Cash4Offers.com. Our Privacy Policy is an evolving document and as such will be updated periodically. We welcome feedback about the guidelines 
outlined in our policy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Cash4Offers.com will control all information collected as a result of your membership in The Cash4Offers.com. We do not give, 
sell, rent, share, or trade any identifiable personal information regarding our members to any third party, with the exception of third-party advertisers 
who work with The Cash4Offers.com to provide our subscribed members with occasional, targeted advertisements through the site's Direct Mail system or 
as outlined elsewhere in this document.</p></li>

<li><p>In our online registration form, we require you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself including full name, 
address, e-mail address, and phone number. We then require that our members complete a short demographic profile. We will process this information to 
administer your membership and to enable you to take advantage of other member benefits. We will process this membership and demographic information to 
build a profile of your interests and activities so that our advertisers can send you advertisements, offers and other benefits that are most likely to 
be of interest to you. As we aggregate this type of information about all of our members, we offer summaries to our advertisers and other interested parties 
so that they can learn what products and services are most popular to consumers, but we do not disclose our members' names, addresses, e-mail addresses, 
phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information to these third parties.</p></li>

<li><p>We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or 
promotion sponsored by The Cash4Offers.com and/or when you report a problem with any of our services. Personal information gathered in this way will be 
used solely for the transaction itself unless otherwise specifically explained at the time the information is collected. The Cash4Offers.com may retain 
and reference aggregate information about member preferences gathered in these ways.</p></li>

<li><p>The Cash4Offers.com utilizes 'cookies' for convenience so that members will not have to log in to the site each time they visit. 
A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered into the memory of your computer. In this case, it is used to remember your username and password. 
Most cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies, 
if your browser permits, or to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your 
discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for notification each time a cookie is being sent, you will need to input your username and 
password each time you visit The Cash4Offers.com site.</p></li>

<li><p>We use your e-mail address to verify your identity and protect against fraud and to contact you when necessary. In addition, 
our advertisers may choose to occasionally send targeted e-mail to our subscribed members. These direct e-mail messages usually contain some sort of sale, 
special or promotion that the advertiser is offering. Please note that these messages are sent out on a periodic basis and our advertisers will select a 
certain segment of our member base to contact based on the demographic profile that they are targeting. If you would not like to receive these periodic 
e-mails, you may cancel your membership from member control panel.</p></li>

<li><p>If a member elects to use our affiliate e-mail to refer a friend, we ask them for the friend's e-mail address. The Cash4Offers.com 
will send a one-time invitation to visit the site. We do not store the e-mail address after the invitation is sent. The referred friend may contact us 
with any questions or concerns.</p></li>

<li><p>The Cash4Offers.com may share non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third 
parties. Further, we can - and you authorize us to - disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our 
sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p></li>

<li><p>The Cash4Offers.com contains links to many web sites. The Cash4Offers.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the 
content of these web sites.</p></li>

<li><p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, The Cash4Offers.com has used 
appropriate industry standard procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewall, encryption, token authentication, 
application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our network and its data. However, no data 
transmitted over the Internet can be 100% secure.</p></li>

<li><p>You must be at least 18 years of age to become a member of The Cash4Offers.com. If you have any questions or concerns about The 
Cash4Offers.com membership policies, please <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://www.cash4offers.com/contact">contact us</a>.</p></li>

from time to time. It is the responsibility of our members to review this policy periodically to ensure that they are aware of our rules and regulations 
so users are aware of what Personally Identifiable Information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. In the 
event that a change is made after user registration the user will be notified via e-mail and be given the opportunity to opt-out prior to those changes 
going into effect. This policy will be available on this page for members to read.</p></li>
