certain new product features and services, and to contact you about
product upgrades. Additionally, if you have chosen to receive email
communications, you will receive our infrequent news and
announcements.</p>

<h1>PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR USERS OF WEBSITES OPERATED BY CASPIO
CLIENTS</h1>

<h3>OUR PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>Because your trust and confidence is important to us, Caspio
conducts its Caspio services under the following privacy
principles:</p>

<h3>CASPIO ACTS AS AN AGENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS</h3>

<p>Caspio acts as an Agent for each of our Customers, in that we
provide our services solely for the benefit of the customer. Each
of our customers uses Caspio services to collect data, or to
provide information to their websites visitors; they use our
services to create and operate database-powered web forms and
applications. Each customer instructs us as to what types of data
it would like us to collect on its behalf. This data may include
the information you explicitly enter in web forms including
personally identifiable information, or data implicitly collected
through visiting a webpage or logging in to a password-protected
area. We also collect certain technical information, such as the
browser version and operating system. In each customer agreement,
we promise that we will not make use of any data that we collect on
the customer's behalf except as necessary to provide our services
to that customer. We do not aggregate, sell, transfer, or otherwise
disclose it to anyone but the customer, or pursuant to the
customer's instructions. We do, however, reserve a limited right to
disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a
court or other governmental authority.</p>

<h3>OUR CUSTOMERS' USE OF CASPIO SERVICES</h3>

<p>We ask each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws,
rules and regulations, as we promise our clients that we will do
ourselves. We also recommend that each customer obtain all
necessary consents from visitors to its website(s), post an online
privacy policy that provides each visitor with notice of its data
collection and use practices (including the customer's use of
Caspio's services), and provide a link to the Caspio's privacy
policy.</p>

use cookies only when necessary to maintain the identity of the
