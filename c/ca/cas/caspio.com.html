OVERVIEW<br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Caspio, Inc. is committed to respecting
your privacy and the privacy of the information in your account. That
is why we have established this privacy policy. Our intention is to
treat your information with the utmost care and consideration. </font>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Caspio by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@caspio.com">privacy@caspio.com</a>.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">This Privacy Policy contains Caspio's
handling of personally identifiable information that is gathered when
you are on Caspio's site, and when you use Caspio's services â€” i.e.
Data stored in your Caspio Bridge account. This policy does not cover
or apply to the practices of companies that Caspio does not own or
control, or to non-Caspio employees.
</font></p><p>

<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Caspio collects personally identifiable
information when you register for a Caspio Bridge account, when you
sign up to become a Caspio affiliate, when you sign up to become a
Caspio Bridge reseller, when you fill out any form requesting
information, support, or specific products and services information,
and when you subscribe to our newsletter. Caspio may also receive
personally identifiable information from its business partners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Caspio collects the
  following personally identifiable information: your name, email
  address, employer or company. You also have the option of supplying us
  with your phone, URL, occupation, and type of business or industry.
  Additionally, when you sign up for a Caspio Bridge paid account, Caspio
  also collects your billing information, including your credit card
  number, expiration date, and billing address.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Caspio also asks its
  affiliates and resellers to provide either their Tax ID or Social
  Security Number so we can comply with IRS regulations in regards to
  commissions and payments.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Caspio also automatically
  receives and records information on our server logs from your browser
  including your IP address, browser type, referrer page, domain name,
  access time, entry page, exit page, operating system type, and search
  engine keywords used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Caspio mainly uses the
  information it collects to measure our business success, to identify
  the most effective ways to reach you, the customer, to more effectively
  meet your needs and requests for certain new product features and
  services, and to contact you about product upgrades. Additionally, if
  you have chosen to receive email communications, you will receive our
  infrequent newsletter and announcements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that Caspio also hosts the data stored in your Caspio Bridge account.  That data is strictly your property. </font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Certain Caspio employees have various
access levels to Caspio systems, including databases, for the purposes
of backups, maintenance, debugging, and other administrative and
programming activities. However, Caspio will not monitor, edit,
disclose, sell, or rent neither your data stored in your Caspio Bridge
account, nor your personally identifiable information to anyone other
than what is disclosed below.
</font>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">It is only under the following circumstances that Caspio may send your information to other companies or people: 
</font></p><p>

  <font face="Arial" size="2">When we have your consent to share the information. 

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we need to share your
  information to provide you with a service or product you are
  requesting. For example: if you sign up for Caspio Bridge through one
  of our authorized resellers.
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we need to send the information to companies that work on our behalf to process an order you have made, or so they can provide a product or service to you. Note that these
  companies are not allowed to use your information for any reason other
  than to support us in assisting you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we conform to edicts of the law, to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you have violated our Caspio Bridge Service Terms of Use Agreement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our customers or the public. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we need to protect and defend the rights or property of Caspio. </font></p>
<p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">From time to time we may share aggregate
data about our customers with other companies. In such cases no
personally identifiable data will be made available to third parties.
</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">COOKIES<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Cookies are identifiers usually sent

  their operation. Certain services and functionalities will not work if you disable cookie functions on your browser. </font></p>
<p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">CHANIGNG AND EDITING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION <br>

  DataPages can be deployed securely using SSL at no extra charge. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Additionally, all systems are backed up on a daily basis. </font></p>
<p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES 
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">If we are going to use your personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice
as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices
that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we
will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the
change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email
users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them
of the changes in our privacy practices.
