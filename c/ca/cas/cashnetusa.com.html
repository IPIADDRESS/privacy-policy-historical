This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a <strong>“Device”</strong>) whenever you visit or interact with our site.

      <p>This Usage Information may include:</p>
      <ul>

      <p>
        We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (<strong>“Tracking Technologies”</strong>). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
      </p>
      <p><strong><i>Cookies</i></strong>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the site.  A web browser is usually set to accept cookies automatically but can be changed to decline them.  The Help section of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the web browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. In most cases, a visitor may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our websites.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.  Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>

      <p>
        <strong><i>Web Beacons.</i></strong>  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our site’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the site, to monitor how users navigate the site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><i>Embedded Scripts.</i></strong>  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the site, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party Service Provider, is active only while you are connected to the site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><i>Browser Fingerprinting.</i></strong>  Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><i>ETag, or entity tag.</i></strong>  A feature of the cache in browsers.  It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
      </p>
      <p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>

      <p><strong><i>Strictly Necessary.</i></strong>  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of site functionality.</p>

      <p><strong><i>PerformanceRelated.</i></strong>  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the site, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the site.</p>

      <p><strong><i>FunctionalityRelated.</i></strong>  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the site, including identifying you when you signin to our site or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on our site.</p>

      <p>
        <strong><i>TargetingRelated.</i></strong>  We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our site and third-party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content.  This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements or content that has been delivered to you.
      </p>

      <p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the site.  Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with our site and this may involve the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our site and accept that our statements under this Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.  Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals).  Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.  If you would like more information on self-regulatory programs that permit you to exercise choice, see the Section entitled “Interest-Based Advertising” below.</p>

        You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration.  The site may allow you to review, correct or update personally identifiable information you have provided through the site’s registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes by contacting us <a href="/contact-us.html">here</a>. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable (but we may retain prior information as business records).  With respect to our mobile and other applications (i.e., when we are the application publisher), you can prospectively stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application.  You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace.  Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.   When you edit your personally identifiable information or change your preferences on the site, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes.  You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails or in some cases by logging into your site account and changing your communication preferences.  This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails the opt-out will be so limited.  Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our site, such as administrative and service announcements and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.

        Data about your activities online is being collected on our website for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests.  We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics Service Providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content.  Third parties may offer you a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.  This section of the Policy provides details and explains how to exercise that choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks administered by third parties.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the technologies described in the “Automatic Information and Cookies” Section above, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information they collect includes information about your visits to our websites, such as the pages you have viewed.  These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.  You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your device and may set or change settings on your device in connection with the associated operations.  Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as sites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  We and third-party vendors, including Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites.  To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TCi3R4mL7qb_WRaELD5Z_YPR5O5InCvFFgPTJ5jcWbHaE2tb_jOvoIkA5pP6F9oEvdNnVsMQuwj5HJV2Pg-6RADnzbP9mI_0dcxfwak_4v1_JeRylUrylqkCThZSDLaaI0iKKqsfaEE9pvltfXxOZH9ZarVDcsj6b7B5xIgS7XgzMgJjPq6m-L38v01JOJumwnkQh8Kt">here</a>.

      <p>
        Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data.  Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with the information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice.  The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.  Further, while we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the website, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.  Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Additional information is available on the NAI’s website accessible by the above link.  You may also be able to opt-out of receiving third-party behavioral ads by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed.  Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third-parties’ opt-out options.

    &lt;strong&gt;
        PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
    &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Introduction and Overview&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Welcome!  You have arrived at &lt;strong&gt;www.cashnetusa.com&lt;/strong&gt; and/or are otherwise interacting with our Service (defined below), which is owned, operated, licensed and controlled by &lt;strong&gt;CNU Online Holdings&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;LLC&lt;/strong&gt; (collectively, &lt;strong&gt;“Company,” “we,” “our,”&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;“us”&lt;/strong&gt;).  These Terms of Use (&lt;strong&gt;“Terms”&lt;/strong&gt;) govern your use of any online service location (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt;, website or mobile app) that posts a link to these Terms (&lt;strong&gt;“Site”&lt;/strong&gt;), and also applies to all features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and other services that are owned and controlled by us and that are available through or interact with a Site, and/or that post or link to these Terms (collectively with the Site, the &lt;strong&gt;“Service”&lt;/strong&gt;), regardless of how you access or use it, whether via computer, mobile device or otherwise.  By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept the Service’s &lt;a href="/privacy_policy.html"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with the &lt;a href="/privacy_policy.html"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.  By using the Service, you further agree that Company may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Device (defined below) in order to allow for or optimize your use of the Service. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    It’s important that you read these entire Terms; but to help facilitate your review, here are some of the more significant terms we want to bring to your initial attention that are further detailed below.  Capitalized terms have the meanings given to them where defined in these Terms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Each time you use the Service, the Terms and any applicable Additional Terms (defined below) then posted apply so you should check back each time you return for any updates. 
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        You may only use the Content (defined below) on the Service in connection with your permitted activities on the Service and not in an offline environment or in connection with another site or service. (&lt;a href="#service-content"&gt;Section 1&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="#content-use-restrictions"&gt;Section 3&lt;/a&gt;. You grant us a broad license to content you submit or post. (&lt;a href="#community-usage"&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Except as set forth in the &lt;a href="/privacy_policy.html"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; that applies to the Service, you and we do not have a confidential, fiduciary, or any other special relationship by virtue of your use of the Service or your communications to us through or related to the Service. (&lt;a href="#community-usage"&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        You consent to our &lt;a href="/privacy_policy.html"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; and our practices detailed in it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        Many types of disputes that may arise in connection with your access to and use of the Service are subject to mandatory arbitration – which includes your waiver of a right to a jury trial. (&lt;a href="#dispute-resolution"&gt;Section 10&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        We are providing the Service to you on an “as-is” basis, without any warranty of any kind, and our liability to you in connection with your use of the Service is very limited.  Many other limitations and disclaimers relate to your use of the Service.  (&lt;a href="#disclaimer-of-representations-and-warranties"&gt;Section 11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#limitations-of-our-liability"&gt;Section 12&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;u&gt;If You Want to Use the Service,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    then carefully read these entire Terms (including all links to details), as they constitute a written agreement between you and us and they affect your legal rights and obligations.  The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.  If you are under the age of majority, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian who agrees to these Terms and to be responsible for your use.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Each time you access and/or use the Service (other than to simply read these Terms), you agree to be bound by and comply with the Terms and any Additional Terms then posted. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Therefore, do not use the Service if you do not agree.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The business realities associated with operating the Service are such that, without the limitations that are set forth in these Terms – such as your grants and waivers of rights, the limitations on our liability, your indemnity of us, and our arbitration of certain disputes – we would not make the Service available to you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    By accessing and/or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.  In some instances, both these Terms and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Service or to a service or product offered via the Service (in each such instance, and collectively &lt;strong&gt;“Additional Terms”&lt;/strong&gt;).  To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.  Please also review the terms of the Service’s &lt;a href="/privacy_policy.html"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;, which you accept by using the Service.

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(i) &lt;u&gt;General&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Company may now or in the future offer users of the Service the opportunity to create, post, upload, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, or otherwise make available on or submit through the Service messages, text, illustrations, files, images, graphics, photos, comments, responses, sounds, music, videos, information, content, ratings, reviews, data, questions, suggestions, personally identifiable information, or other information or materials and the ideas contained therein (collectively, &lt;strong&gt;“User-Generated Content”&lt;/strong&gt;).  Company may allow you to do this through forums, blogs, message boards, content creation tools, e-mail and other communications functionality.  Subject to the rights and license you grant in these Terms of Use, you retain whatever legally cognizable right, title, and interest that you have in your User-Generated Content and you remain ultimately responsible for it.

Upon Company’s request, you will furnish us with any documentation necessary to substantiate the rights to such content and to verify your compliance with these Terms of Use.  You acknowledge that the Internet and mobile communications may be subject to breaches of security and that you are aware that submissions of User-Generated Content may not be secure, and you will consider this before submitting any User-Generated Content and do so at your own risk.

Any Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you post on or send to us via the Service are deemed User-Generated Content and licensed to us as set forth below. In addition, Company retains all of the rights held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(iii)   &lt;u&gt;License to Company of Your User-Generated Content.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a contest official rules), which specifically govern the submission of your User-Generated Content), you hereby grant to Company, and you agree to grant to Company, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same.  Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services.

Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.  To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.  You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(iv)    &lt;u&gt;Company’s Exclusive Right to Manage our Service.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Company may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your User-Generated Content, and Company may, in its sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of User-Generated Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of User-Generated Content venues in an appropriate manner.  Without limitation, we may do so to address content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the content restrictions set forth below in the Rules (defined below).  Such User-Generated Content submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the Service by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User-Generated Content on the Service or elsewhere.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(v) &lt;u&gt;Representations and Warranties Related to Your User-Generated Content.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Each time you submit any User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User-Generated Content you submit, and that, as to that User-Generated Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User-Generated Content, or you have a lawful right to submit the User-Generated Content and grant Company the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms, all without any Company obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of Company; (b) the User-Generated Content is accurate; (c) the User-Generated Content does not and, as to Company’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d) the User-Generated Content will not violate these Terms (including the Rules), or cause injury or harm to any person.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(vi)    &lt;u&gt;Enforcement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Company has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User-Generated Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User-Generated Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at Company’s cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint Company as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;B.  &lt;u&gt;Community Usage Rules.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules (&lt;strong&gt;“Rules”&lt;/strong&gt;) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Service’s online communities (&lt;strong&gt;“Communities”&lt;/strong&gt;). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(i) Nature of Rules.&lt;/strong&gt;  Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Your User-Generated Content.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms.  Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.  Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.  If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to Company.  (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to Company as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Speaking of Photos:  No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Act Appropriately.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.  Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.  If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the Service.  Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.  Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap.  Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relevance to Venue.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All of your Service activities must be relevant to the venue, as determined by us.  For example, if we post an article on the Service about making smart financial decisions and allow you to submit User-Generated Content about that article, your User-Generated Content should be about or related to the topic of that article in some way.  If you choose to submit User-Generated Content that is unrelated or irrelevant to the topic, we have the right to remove or not otherwise post such materials.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Others Can See.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.  However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.  Do not submit personally identifying information (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt;, first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Don’t Share Other Peoples’ Personal Information.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, e-mail address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by Company. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Don’t Damage the Service or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    If you submit User-Generated Content that Company reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.  However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law.  We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.  Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Service.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(ii)   &lt;u&gt; Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.  We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.  We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.  Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt;, when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;C.  &lt;u&gt;Availability of Service and Content.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Company may immediately suspend or terminate the availability of the Service and Content (and any elements and features of them), in whole or in part, for any reason, in Company’s sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;D. &lt;u&gt; Reservation of All Rights Not Granted as to Content and Service.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  These Terms and any Additional Terms include only narrow, limited grants of rights to Content and to use and access the Service.  No right or license may be construed, under any legal theory, by implication, estoppel, industry custom, or otherwise.  All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Company and its licensors and other third parties. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt; Any unauthorized use of any Content or the Service for any purpose is prohibited.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    
    In order to access or use some of the features on the Service, you may be required to log-in to your Service account.  The Service’s practices governing any resulting collection and use of your personal information are disclosed in its &lt;a href="/privacy_policy.html"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.  If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username, then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an e-mail notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You will not use a username (or e-mail address) that is already being used by someone else, may impersonate another person, belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or is offensive.  We may reject the use of any password, username, or e-mail address for any other reason in our sole discretion; (ii) You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and, as permitted, to maintain and update it continuously and promptly to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (iii) You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, password, and username – whether or not you authorized the activity; (iv) You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your Device so that others may not access any password protected portion of the Service using your name, username, or password; (v) You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, password, or username, or any other breach of security; and (vi) You will not sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If any information that you provide, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information that you provide, is false, inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or violates these Terms, any Additional Terms, or any applicable law, then we may suspend or terminate your account.  We also reserve the more general and broad right to terminate your account or suspend or otherwise deny you access to it or its benefits – all in our sole discretion, for any reason, and without advance notice or liability.

    &lt;a name="alleging-copyright-infringement"&gt;5. &lt;u&gt;Procedure For Alleging Copyright Infringement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A.  &lt;u&gt;DMCA Notice.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Company will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“&lt;strong&gt;DMCA&lt;/strong&gt;”), as set forth below.  If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner’s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i)  a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice”; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(ii)     a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iii)    a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Service on which the material appears); &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(iv)     your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(v)  a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(vi)     a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(vii)   your electronic or physical signature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Mail: &lt;strong&gt;CNU Online Holdings, LLC, 200 W. Jackson Blvd., Suite 2400, Chicago, IL  60606.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By E-Mail:   &lt;strong&gt;registeredagent@cashnetusa.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Facsimile:   &lt;strong&gt;866.413.3888&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.  Company may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Company may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.  That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Without limiting Company’s other rights, Company may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by Company.  See &lt;a href="#accounts"&gt;Section 4&lt;/a&gt;, above.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;B.   Counter-Notification.&lt;/strong&gt;  If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to Company is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.  Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:
&lt;/p&gt;

    If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.  However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.  You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

    &lt;li&gt;(f)     a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the owner of the intellectual property at issue (or, if you are not the owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that is allegedly infringed); and&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Certain portions of this Section 10 are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  You and Company agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 10.A.  Your notice to us must be sent to:  &lt;strong&gt;CNU Online Holdingds, LLC,&lt;/strong&gt; 200 W. Jackson Blvd., Suite 2400, Chicago, IL  60606 (Attn: General Counsel).  For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Company and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Company to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Company, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;B.  &lt;u&gt;Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;(i) &lt;u&gt;Arbitration.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;    If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 10.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 10.B.  If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 10.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and Company consent, in a writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of Company, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.  In such a case (and only in such a case), that E
&lt;p&gt;
    Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&lt;strong&gt;“AAA”&lt;/strong&gt;).  If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.  If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if Company elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.  The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.  If you and Company do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 10.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 10.B will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&lt;strong&gt;“JAMS”&lt;/strong&gt;) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of Company consent to in writing.  The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;(ii)    &lt;u&gt;Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees).  However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.  All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.  If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.  You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Company to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 10 to be enforceable, then Company will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.  Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.  Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;C. &lt;u&gt; Limited Time To File Claims.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;D.  &lt;u&gt;Injunctive Relief. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 will not apply to any legal action taken by Company to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or Company’s intellectual property rights (including such Company may claim that may be in dispute), Company’s operations, and/or Company’s products or services.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;E. &lt;u&gt; Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 10.G.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;F.  &lt;u&gt;No Class Action Matters.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 10.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 10.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 10.G.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;G.  &lt;u&gt;Federal and State Courts in Cook County, IL.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 10.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Cook County, Illinois.  Accordingly, you and Company consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.

&lt;p&gt;
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY COMPANY PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including personal injury or death or for any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages that are directly or indirectly related to:

    &lt;li&gt;(b)     your use of or inability to use the Service, or the performance of the Service; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(c)     any action taken in connection with an investigation by Company Parties or law enforcement authorities regarding your access to or use of the Service;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(d)     any action taken in connection with copyright or other intellectual property owners or other rights owners; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(e)     any errors or omissions in the Service’s technical operation; or &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;(f)     any damage to any user’s computer, hardware, software, modem, or other equipment or technology, including damage from any security breach or from any virus, bugs, tampering, fraud, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer line, or network failure or any other technical or other malfunction, including losses or damages in the form of lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or equipment failure or malfunction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The foregoing limitations of liability will apply even if any of the foregoing events or circumstances were foreseeable and even if Company Parties were advised of or should have known of the possibility of such losses or damages, regardless of whether you bring an action based in contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort (including whether caused, in whole or in part, by negligence, acts of god, telecommunications failure, or destruction of the Service).  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages of the sort that are described above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
        EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED IN ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION(S) THAT UNDERLIE THE CLAIM(S); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION WILL NOT APPLY IF A TRIBUNAL WITH APPLICABLE JURISDICTION FINDS SUCH TO BE UNCONSCIONABLE.

    IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.  THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY COMPANY (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF COMPANY.

    These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use).  AS OUR SERVICE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SERVICE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SERVICE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED.  ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Therefore, you should review the posted terms of service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission).  The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You should frequently check the home page, and the e-mail you associated with your Account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice.  You can reject any new, revised or additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Service and related services.

The Service may describe products and services that are available only in the U.S.A. (or only parts of it) and are not available worldwide.  We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service, or other feature described or available on the Service to any person, entity, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service, or other feature that we provide.

You are responsible for complying with all trade regulations and laws both foreign and domestic.  Except as authorized by law, you agree and warrant not to export or re-export the software to any county, or to any person, entity, or end-user subject to U.S. export controls, including as set forth in subsections (i) – (iii) above.

    &lt;strong&gt;F.  &lt;u&gt;Severability; Interpretation.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the Additional Terms (which will remain in full force and effect).  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.  Wherever the word “including” is used in these Terms or any Additional Terms, the word will be deemed to mean “including, without limitation”.  The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.

Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Service, or upon notice from Company, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Service.  The provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to Company in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;J. &lt;u&gt; No Waiver.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or Company in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.
