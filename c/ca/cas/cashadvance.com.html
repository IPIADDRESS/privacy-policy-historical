<p><span class="textheading">About Us</span></p>
<p>Cashnow, Inc. (“Company” or “we” or “our”), owns and operates the website located at www.CashAdvance.com, (the “Site”). Through the Site, Company operates a prospective customer data base (the “Service”), by which it compiles, sorts and sells contact information to businesses on behalf of individual consumers who have shown an interest in applying for a business’ products or services and has affirmatively asked to be contacted by a representative of a product or service business. Company utilizes third party vendors, third party affiliates, and a variety of media advertisements to promote the Site to consumers interested in completing an online application at our Site or to supplement our database by purchasing their database of consumers who have completed applications on websites other than Company’s and have affirmatively requested receipt of information about product or service offerings similar to those offered on Company’s Site.</p>
<p>Company also promotes its product and service offerings via e-mail or telephone to consumers who requested that they be contacted either through our online application opt-in process via our Site or through an Opt-In process on one of our many vendor or affiliate sites (“List Members”). List Members will then receive email or telephone contacts only for so long as they wish to continue to receive such contacts.</p>

List Members may remove themselves from further contact from Company by clicking on the OPT-Out link contained in each e-mail, or by sending in an OPT-Out request via e-mail to support@cashadvance.com.<br>
If List Member chooses to remove themselves from our contact list, if applicable, we will also forward this request to the specific vendor or affiliate marketer who provided List Member’s informational request to us so that they can include List Member on their do-not-contact list as well. Please bear in mind that if List Member’s information was purchased commercially from a third party vendor, Company may not be the only data company List Member’s information was sold to. Additionally, our third party vendor or affiliate may have purchased List Member contact information from an additional third party and thus List Member may continue to receive contacts from those third party companies. Company is not responsible for stopping all unwanted contact from sources beyond our immediate control.</p>
