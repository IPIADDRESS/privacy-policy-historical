	<br>

In doing so, a merchant may share information about you with us, with your email address, when you attempt to pay that merchant. We use this information to confirm to that merchant that you are a CashEnvoy customer and that the merchant should enable CashEnvoy as a form of payment for your purchase. <br>
	<br>
	Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number , ATm Card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through CashEnvoy, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with s subpoena or other legal process.<br>
