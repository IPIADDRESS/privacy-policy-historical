<p><b>THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES OF CASHNETWORK.COM.</b></p>
<p><b>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.</b></p>
<p><b>1.1 Survey Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not
limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, 
or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties
(collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means
using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and
"offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in
the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In
the Surveys, CASHNETWORK.COM or a Third Party (a "Third Party") may
ask an individual to provide various information to CASHNETWORK.COM, which may
include his or her name, email address, street address, postal/zip code,
telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date,
gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social
insurance/security number, employment information, personal and online
interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time
(together, "Survey Information"). 
CASHNETWORK.COM may also collect information concerning an individual
from another source and uses that information in combination with information
provided from this web site. Completing
the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to
provide Survey Information to CASHNETWORK.COM or Third Party.</p>
<p><b>1.2 Site Membership or Registration.</b></p>
<p>To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal
communications from CASHNETWORK.COM, this Privacy Policy also applies to
consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from CASHNETWORK.COM,
whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise. 
We collect information in certain portions of
our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or
participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to
questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison
searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). 
The personal profile information you submit to
CASHNETWORK.COM remains your property, but by submitting that information to
CASHNETWORK.COM, you grant CASHNETWORK.COM, the right to use that information
for marketing purposes. CASHNETWORK.COM may also use such information for content improvement and feedback
purposes. We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other
businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. These businesses may include providers of
direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference,
data enhancement, suppression and validation. In addition, CASHNETWORK.COM
reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event
CASHNETWORK.COM believes that the membership is being or has been used in
violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is
subpoenaed, if CASHNETWORK.COM is sold or acquired, or when CASHNETWORK.COM
deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or
communication to any Third Party when CASHNETWORK.COM, in its sole discretion,
determines the disclosure to be appropriate.</p>
<p>"Subscription"
occurs when an end-user registers for CASHNETWORK.COM's services, either via
registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's
website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing. CASHNETWORK.COM
collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on:
information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and
response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information
provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators.
Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name,
email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number, activity,
interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information
enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our
clients to promote and sell their products and services.</p>
<p><b>1.3 Third Party List Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM
collects information from individuals when an individual provides information
to a Third Party and CASHNETWORK.COM subsequently purchases, licenses, or
otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the
"Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email
address, street address, postal/zip code, telephone numbers (including cell
phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and
marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online
interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to
the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring
Third Party List Information, CASHNETWORK.COM seeks assurances from the Seller
that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to
CASHNETWORK.COM and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from
Advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the
Seller's list.</p>
<p><b>1.4 Other Information.</b></p>
<p>Other occasions when CASHNETWORK.COM obtains information from individuals include (1)
when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an
incentive offered by CASHNETWORK.COM or by a Third Party, (2) when an
individual requests assistance through CASHNETWORK.COM's customer service
department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a
CASHNETWORK.COM service or newsletter (together, "Other
Information").</p>
<p><b>1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain
Internet-related information about an individual with information about the
individual in our database. Additionally, CASHNETWORK.COM may use other new and
evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology
Information").</p>
<p><b>(a) Cookies.</b></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's
computer that allows CASHNETWORK.COM to identify the individual with his or her
corresponding data that resides in CASHNETWORK.COM's database.
You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com.
Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
<p><b>(b) Web Beacons.</b></p>
<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page
(see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer
an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a
database and associate the individual with previously acquired information
about an individual in a database. This allows CASHNETWORK.COM to track certain websites an individual visits
online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. In addition to using web
beacons on web pages, CASHNETWORK.COM also uses web beacons in email messages
sent to individuals listed in CASHNETWORK.COM's database.</p>
<p><b>(c) New Technology.</b></p>
<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly
evolving, as is CASHNETWORK.COM's use of new and evolving technology. 
As a result, CASHNETWORK.COM strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
<p><b>(d) Usage Tracking.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by
users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while
viewing our emails or visiting our websites.</p>
<p><b>(e) Log Files.</b></p>
<p>Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.</p>
<p><b>(f) Optional Registration.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers.
During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information.
This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services.</p>
<p><b>(g) Feedback and Inquiries.</b></p>
<p>You have the ability to contact CASHNETWORK.COM to provide us with their
feedback. CASHNETWORK.COM uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues.</p>
<p><b>1.6 Outside Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other
sources of information outside of CASHNETWORK.COM including information located
in public databases ("Outside Information").</p>
<p><b>1.7 Individual Information.</b></p>
<p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List
Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside
Information, and any other information CASHNETWORK.COM gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
<p><b>1.8 No Information Collected from Children.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If CASHNETWORK.COM obtains
actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be 
immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, 
CASHNETWORK.COM has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. CASHNETWORK.COM has
designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
<p><b>1.9 Credit Card Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such
as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when
an individual places an order from CASHNETWORK.COM. When the Credit Card Information is submitted
to CASHNETWORK.COM, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL
encryption software. CASHNETWORK.COM will use the Credit Card Information for
purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit
Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to
complete the purchase transaction.</p>
<p><b>1.10 Links to External Websites.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM's emails and websites may contain links to external websites. You will be taken to external websites if you
click on these links. Your information may be passed from CASHNETWORK.COM's database to the external website, and/or
external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website).
CASHNETWORK.COM is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner. 
We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
<p><b>2. USE OF INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION.</b></p>
<p><b>2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how CASHNETWORK.COM currently uses
Individual Information, but CASHNETWORK.COM may change or broaden its use at
any time. As noted above, CASHNETWORK.COM may update this policy from time to time. CASHNETWORK.COM may
use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by
means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online
banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.</p>
<p><b>2.2 Email and Unsubscribe Policy.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to
individuals. CASHNETWORK.COM may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.
If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at
the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all CASHNETWORK.COM's
email lists, a person must send an email to info@cashnetwork.com.</p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM's unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings
disseminated by CASHNETWORK.COM on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings
sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be
shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.</p>
<p>You should also note that unsubscribing from CASHNETWORK.COM's electronic mailings
will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber's information from any Third
Party associates and licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate
databases from CASHNETWORK.COM, and you will need to unsubscribe from each
source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and
which to discontinue.</p>
<p><b>2.3 Content of Email Messages.</b></p>
<p>In certain commercial email messages sent by or for CASHNETWORK.COM, an
Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line, but hitting the "Reply" button will
not cause a reply email to be sent to CASHNETWORK.COM. The "Subject:" line of
CASHNETWORK.COM email messages will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to CASHNETWORK.COM.</p>
<p><b>2.4 Solicited Email.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive
email from CASHNETWORK.COM or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party
websites to receive email from Third Parties such as CASHNETWORK.COM. CASHNETWORK.COM does not send unsolicited
email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to
CASHNETWORK.COM S email messages.</p>
<p><b>2.5 Targeted Advertising.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual.
When an individual is using the Internet, CASHNETWORK.COM uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.7 below) to
associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and
CASHNETWORK.COM attempts to show advertising for products and services in which
the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by
means of Technology Information, and otherwise. CASHNETWORK.COM may, at its
discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones,
and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>
<p><b>2.6 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM may use Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to
individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.</p>
<p><b>2.7 Use of Technology Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and
Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to
make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online
browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of
CASHNETWORK.COM's websites are most frequently visited. This information helps
CASHNETWORK.COM to better understand the online habits of individuals so that
CASHNETWORK.COM can target advertising and promotions to them.</p>
<p><b>2.8 Profiles of Individuals.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual.
A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual
Information such as information obtained from public databases.</p>
<p><b>2.9 Storage of Individual Information.</b></p>
<p>CASHNETWORK.COM stores the Individual Information in a database on its computers.
Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the
information under CASHNETWORK.COM's control. Not withstanding such measures, CASHNETWORK.COM cannot guarantee that
its security measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed,
and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.</p>

or regulatory requirements, and/or to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.</p>

of CASHNETWORK.COM. If an individual wants to see their personal information, they may contact the Privacy Officer.

<p>CASHNETWORK.COM may ask that the individual put their request in writing. If CASHNETWORK.COM is
unable to give access, CASHNETWORK.COM will inform the individual within 30
days, in writing, with the reasons for not granting access.</p>
<p><b>3.6 Do Not Call Registry Waiver.</b></p>
<p>Even though you may be on a National or State DO NOT CALL list, by submitting your
contact information which may include your telephone number, you are expressly
authorizing us and our advertising businesses and affiliates to contact you by
telephone at the number you have used regarding the information you have expressed.</p>

<p><b>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</b></p>
<p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together,
"Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the
