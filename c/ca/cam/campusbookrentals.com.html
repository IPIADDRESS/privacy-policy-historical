    In addition, cookies are used by default on certain pages and fields of our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personally identifiable information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information. We also use the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site. For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log in manually each time you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember who you are.

    <br>
    <strong>Surveys, Contests, Testimonials</strong> <br>
    From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. testimonial). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your opinions, feedback, testimonials, etc. In the event of a contest, we will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the sponsor. <br>

We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. <br>
    <br>
    We use your e-mail address to communicate order information to you and to provide you with other communications or information that you have requested from CampusBookRentals.com. <br>

    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</span></strong> <br>
    Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
    <br>
    By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or <u>comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process</u> served on our website. <br>
    <br>
    As a general proposition, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. <br>

    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">8. Security</span></strong> <br>
    In order to process and protect your credit card details, our payment provider, Internet Secure uses SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. The secure server is hosted by Authorize.net and not CampusBookRentals.com™. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.<span>&nbsp; </span>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

    <p><strong><span class="tangerine">9. Changes to Privacy Policy</span></strong> <br>
    If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email, prior to making such changes. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice, before changes go into affect, on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.<br>

                        On occassion, if the only book we have available is a US teacher's edition, and if it is determined to be the same as the student 
                        edition page for page and word for word, we may elect to send it, though this is very rare.

                        It depends on the shipping method you choose. We offer free shipping anywhere in the contiguous US which can take 7-14 
                        business days. If you choose expedited shipping you can expect your order in about a week (5-8 business days). Remember, we offer 
                        a 21 day no-hassle money-back guarantee if you drop your class, order the wrong book,
                        or just plain change your mind. You won't even pay for shipping.

                        There are no fees for signup. When you rent textbooks from us, there are no membership fees, hidden fees, or anything unusual 
                        whatsoever. We display the price you pay to rent the book, and that's it.  What you see is what you get.

                    <div id="faqContent_8" class="ft-faq-content">
                        Yes, you can. You're only charged the difference between what you already paid to rent the book, and the value of the book at 
                        the time you initially rented. This is what makes renting textbooks so cool; it saves you money, while still allowing you to purchase 
                        the book if you'd like to. If you decide to keep a book, simply log in to your customer account, choose to purchase your book, and it 
                        will walk you through the checkout process.

                        We will do our best to make returning your book(s) simple and easy. As stated above, we even provide the return package with a 
                        prepaid label already attached. If however, books are not returned at the end of the rental period (and after the grace period), as 
                        specified in the rental agreement, the renter will be notified via email that their card will be charged for a 15 day extension of 
                        their book(s). If the book is not returned by the end of the 15 days the next charge will be for the purchase price of the book, which 
                        is: Market Value of Book at time of Rental - (Rental Fee + Extension) = Purchase Price of Book. We do work very hard to resolve every 
                        return discrepancy amicably. We want our customers to be happy and continue to rent textbooks throughout their college careers.
