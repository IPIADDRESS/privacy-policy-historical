    Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under 18 years of age) do not submit any personal information to us.

    In addition, cookies are used by default on certain pages and fields of our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We use cookies so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personally identifiable information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information. We also use the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site. For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log in manually each time you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember who you are. CampusBookRentals.com uses Google Analytics to track site usage; however, no personally identifiable information is shared with Google Analytics or its partners. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Surveys, Contests, Testimonials</strong> <br>
    From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. testimonial). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your opinions, feedback, testimonials, etc. In the event of a contest, we will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the sponsor. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Payment Policies:</strong> <br>
    In order to process payments online we require the billing address for the credit card used and our external payment provider, Internet Secure, requires your credit card number and details. This is all done on a secure Internet Secure server using SSL (secure sockets layer) technology. For additional information on Internet Secure, logon to www.internetsecure.com and read their terms and conditions and policies.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Customer Names and Shipping Addresses</strong>
    <br>
    CampusBookRentals.com uses third party providers to package and deliver books to its customers. Customer names and shipping addresses are shared with our suppliers and shipping providers in order to complete the delivery process. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">3. Our Use of Your Information</span></strong> <br>
    We use personally identifiable information about you to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs. <br>
    <br>
    We use your e-mail address to communicate order information to you and to provide you with other communications or information that you have requested from CampusBookRentals.com. <br>
    <br>
    We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Service Policy and Rental Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using multiple User IDs or alias. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</span></strong> <br>
    Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
    <br>
    By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or <u>comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process</u> served on our website. <br>
    <br>
    As a general proposition, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Legal Requests</strong> <br>
    CampusBookRentals.com™ cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. Local, and international law enforcement agents can request and may receive your personally identifiable information. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">5. "Refer a Friend" Services</span></strong> <br>
    CampusBookRentals.com™ offers a service whereby you can e-mail site content to a friend or colleague. This will involve entering the e-mail address of your friend. We do not use the e-mail addresses you enter for any purpose other than to send your e-mail. We do not store, rent or sell these e-mail addresses. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">6. Control of Your Password</span></strong> <br>
    Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your CampusBookRentals.com™ password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password by visiting the login page on the Site. <br>
    <br>
    If you wish to change your password you can do so at any time through the 'Edit Profile' section of the site. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">7. Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</span></strong> <br>
    You can at any time review and change the information you submitted during registration by visiting the login page on the site. <br>
    <br>
    You must promptly update your information if it changes. Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our forums or other message areas or the feedback area. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">8. Other Information Collectors</span></strong> <br>
    Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are other members of the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><span class="tangerine">9. Security</span></strong> <br>
    In order to process and protect your credit card details, our payment provider, Internet Secure uses SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. The secure server is hosted by Authorize.net and not CampusBookRentals.com™. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.<span>&nbsp; </span>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

    <p><strong><span class="tangerine">10. Changes to Privacy Policy</span></strong> <br>
    If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email, prior to making such changes. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice, before changes go into affect, on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.<br>

                                1. We have an excellent support staff and we're always only a phone call away.
                                <br><br>2. We're one of the pioneers of the textbook rental movement.  The textbook rental movement happened in the summer of 2007, and originally there were only three companies.  We were one of the originals.
                                <br><br>3. You save a lot of money when you rent textbooks.  And if you want to keep your books at the end of the semester, just pay us the difference and the books are all yours.
                                <br><br>4. If for any reason you change your mind about your book(s), you have 30 days to return them for a full refund.

                                2013 is a new year, with a mix of old and new in our making a difference program. First off, we’re keeping our partnership with Operation Smile.  They are an awesome organization that performs life changing cleft lip surgeries on children whose families could not otherwise afford it. The long term improvement in quality of life for the children that receive these surgeries is almost incomprehensible.  We’re honored to support the children of Operation Smile.
                                <br><br>We’ve also set aside <strong>$90,000</strong> in textbook scholarships to be distributed to students in communities just like yours. That’s a lot of books, and we hope to touch a lot of students who could use a hand.
                                <br><br>So add that extra book to your cart. When you rent textbooks from us, you make a difference.
