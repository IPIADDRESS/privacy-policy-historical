		<td valign="top" class="contenttd">	<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">CamYoo, Inc. (“CamYoo” or “we”) operates 
CamYoo.com. This Privacy Policy describes CamYoo’s use and sharing of personally 
identifiable information (“PII”-- your full name, email address, mailing 
address, telephone number) that Members voluntarily provide to CamYoo when they 
register (also known as “Registration PII”). The Term “User” refers to a Visitor 
or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by CamYoo, 
including any CamYoo-branded URL (the “CamYoo Website”), the CamYoo instant 
messaging service, the CamYoo application developer service and other features 
(for example, music and video embedded players), CamYoo mobile services, and any 
other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by CamYoo in 
connection with the CamYoo Website (collectively, the “CamYoo Services”). The 
CamYoo Services are hosted in the United States.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The CamYoo Website is a general audience site and 
does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">From time to time CamYoo may modify this Privacy 
Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection 
and use practices, the features of the CamYoo Services, or technology, and such 
modifications shall be effective upon posting by CamYoo on the CamYoo Website. 
Your continued use of the CamYoo Services after CamYoo posts a revised Privacy 
Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore 
important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are 
updated as to any changes. If CamYoo materially changes its practices regarding 
collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the 
Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and 
have not objected to, the change.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION OF PII AND NON-PII ON 
CamYoo</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">General. When CamYoo collects PII from you it is 
because you are voluntarily submitting Registration PII to us in order to 
register as a Member of CamYoo. CamYoo may also collect PII from you if you 
choose to participate in CamYoo Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, 
and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with products, services, 
newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you 
submit to CamYoo for review.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In addition, CamYoo collects other non-PII 
including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used 
to manage and improve the CamYoo Services, track usage, and for security 
purposes. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">CamYoo Members may also choose to provide or store 
non-PII information in their profiles, including but not limited to date of 
birth, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are 
affiliated (schools, companies), videos and/or pictures, private messages, 
bulletins or personal statements (collectively “Profile Information”). The 
Profile Information in a Member’s profile is provided at his or her sole 
discretion.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">CamYoo Members can change their Registration PII 
and Profile Information at any time and can control how Visitors, other Members 
and CamYoo communicate with them by controlling their account settings, 
available within the “Edit Profile” portion of their CamYoo profile. Link to 
Privacy Settings.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that 
CamYoo places on your computer. CamYoo uses cookies to identify your Internet 
browser, store Users’ preferences, and determine whether you have installed the 
enabling software needed to access certain material on the CamYoo Services. Data 
in cookies may be read to authenticate user sessions or provide 
services.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Third party advertisements displayed on CamYoo 
Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or 
advertisers (known as “third party cookies”). CamYoo does not control these 
third party cookies and Users of the CamYoo Services should check the privacy 
policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how 
it uses cookies. See the “Notice” section below for more information on 
customized advertising on CamYoo. A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in a 
webpage and used to record the number and types of views for that page. CamYoo 
may allow third party pixel tags to be present on CamYoo Services for purposes 
of advertising, providing services or data and statistics 
collection.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">You can program your computer to warn you each time 
a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, 
by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the 
CamYoo Services.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">NOTICE: CamYoo WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT 
ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">When you voluntarily provide PII to CamYoo, we will 
make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why 
the information is being collected and the types of uses CamYoo will make of the 
information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is 
allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">At the time you provide your PII, CamYoo will 
notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See “Choice” below). 
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, CamYoo will not share your PII with 
third parties unless you have given CamYoo permission to do so (See “Use” 
below).</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">CamYoo Services may be linked to Internet sites 
operated by other companies. CamYoo Services may also carry advertisements from 
other companies. CamYoo is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites 
or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated 
with the CamYoo Services or for the privacy practices of third party Internet 
advertising companies. Once you leave CamYoo Services via such a link, access a 
third party application (such as widgets) or click on an advertisement, you 
should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site 
to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from 
you.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">CamYoo Services may also be linked to sites 
operated by companies affiliated with CamYoo (i.e., that are part of the News 
America Group: “Affiliated Companies”). Although all Affiliated Companies adhere 
to the News America corporate Privacy Principles, Users who visit those 
Affiliated Company sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies 
and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy 
Policy.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">CamYoo may use cookies and similar tools to 
customize the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile 
Information you have provided. Profile Information you provide in structured 
profile fields or questions (multiple choice questions like “Marital Status,” 
“Education” and “Children”) (“Structured Profile Information”), information you 
add to open-ended profile fields and questions (essay questions like “About Me,” 
“Interests” and “Movies”) (“Non-Structured Profile Information”) and other 
non-PII about you may also be used to customize the online ads you encounter to 
those we believe are aligned with your interests. For example, based on your 
music interests we might display an advertisement to make sure you are advised 
when your favorite band is coming to town. The information used for this feature 
does not provide your PII or identify you as an individual to third parties. If 
you would like to disable advertising customization for Non-Structured Profile 
Information, please log in and click here.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">
</span></p><div><br>Some of the advertisements that appear on CamYoo Services may also be 
delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies 
utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages 
and to collect non-PII about your visit to or use of CamYoo Services, including 
information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer 
that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these 
companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own 
privacy policies, please click here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>Third party applications (such as widgets) created by third party 
developers may also be available on the CamYoo Services. Third party 
applications are small bits of software, often with interactivity, that can be 
installed into Members’ profiles or shared with other Users. However, CamYoo 
does not control the third party developers, and cannot dictate their actions. 
When a Member engages with a third party application, that Member is interacting 
with the third party developer, not with CamYoo. CamYoo encourages Members not 
to provide PII to the third party’s application unless the Member knows the 
party with whom it is interacting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>CHOICE: CamYoo WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR 
PII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, CamYoo will get your permission 
before we use the PII you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the 
purpose for which it was submitted or share your PII with third parties that are 
not affiliated with CamYoo.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>USE: CamYoo'S USE OF PII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>CamYoo will only use the PII you provide under this Privacy Policy in a 
manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If CamYoo obtains PII from a 
third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also 
governed by this Privacy Policy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to locate other CamYoo Members that you may already know in the 
physical world, CamYoo allows Users to search for Members using Registration PII 
(i.e., full name or email address). CamYoo also allows Users to browse for 
certain Profile Information in order to help connect with Members (i.e., schools 
and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked). CamYoo may also 
enable Members to publicly display some Registration PII as an element of their 
Profile Information if they choose to do so via a profile setting under “Edit 
Profile.” Search engines may index the portion of a Member’s profile (including 
the Profile Information it contains) that is publicly displayed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have consented to receive promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) 
or notifications from CamYoo, CamYoo may periodically use your email address to 
send you such materials related to the CamYoo Services, as applicable. If you 
want to stop receiving such materials from CamYoo, you can change your profile 
settings under “Account Settings,” or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the 
bottom of each email.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>CamYoo employees, agents and contractors must have a business reason to 
obtain access to your PII. CamYoo may share your PII with those who help us 
manage or provide CamYoo Services’ information activities (for example, message 
board administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), 
or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the 
administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions 
and sweepstakes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>These outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some 
information on their servers, but they may only use your PII to provide CamYoo 
with a specific service and not for any other purpose. CamYoo may also provide 
your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive 
certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a 
request requires the sharing of your PII. CamYoo also may share your PII with 
Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to do so.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As described in “Notice” above, CamYoo may customize the advertising and 
marketing messages you receive on the CamYoo Website, or may work with outside 
companies to do so. Your non-PII and/or Profile Information may be shared with 
these companies so this customization can be accomplished. CamYoo prohibits 
these companies from sharing your non-PII and/or Profile Information with any 
third party or from using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, 
number of page views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic 
information may also be shared with CamYoo’s advertisers and business 
partners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There may be instances when CamYoo may access or disclose PII, Profile 
Information or non-PII without providing you a choice in order to: (i) protect 
or defend the legal rights or property of CamYoo, our Affiliated Companies or 
their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our 
agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the CamYoo 
Services or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; 
(iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with 
the law or legal process. In addition, if CamYoo sells all or part of its 
business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or 
is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its 
business, CamYoo may transfer your PII to the party or parties involved in the 
transaction as part of that transaction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When a Member who is located in the European Union chooses to post Profile 
Information that will be publicly disclosed, that Member is responsible for 
ensuring that such information conforms to all local data protection laws. 
CamYoo is not responsible under the EU local data protection laws for 
Member-posted information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SECURITY: CamYoo PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>ACCESS, REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR CHANGE YOUR 
PREFERENCES REGARDING YOUR PII AND HOW TO CONTACT CamYoo ABOUT PRIVACY 
CONCERNS</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Whenever possible, CamYoo Members may review the Registration PII we 
maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any 
PII a Member informs us is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view and 
change your Registration PII, Member preferences and Profile Information by 
logging into your account and accessing features such as “Edit Profile” and 
“Account Settings.”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you ask CamYoo to stop using your PII, CamYoo will honor that request 
while retaining any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with 
applicable federal, state or local law.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you would like to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy or 
CamYoo’s collection and use of your PII please contact CamYoo at:</div>
