            <p>Last updated: October 3, 2008</p>

            <p>Photimark Ltd ("ESS") has created this privacy statement in order to disclose to you the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. This privacy statement only applies to the practices for the free services offered via this web site, and does not apply to any other practices of ESS, for which other policies may apply. For example, if you sign up as a paying customer of ESS (e.g., as a subscribing member) or sign up for services which require a password or log-in, ESS may collect certain information from you. (Our terms of services with respect to services which we provide for which you require a password or log-in are set forth separately at &lt;<a href="/subscriber_terms">Subscriber Agreement, Terms and Conditions</a>&gt;.) If you have questions about ESS's privacy practices with respect to products and services other than this web site (the "Site") e-mail support@camspot.com</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">BROWSING OUR WEB SITE</p>

            <p>If you browse the Site, you do so anonymously. You do not need to provide, and ESS does not collect, personal information, such as your e-mail address. When you visit the Site your browser supplies ESS with your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) but ESS does not link your IP address to any information that is personally identifiable. ESS uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with ESS's server, and to administer the Site.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">COOKIES</p>

            <p>Like most web sites, the Site uses "cookies." A cookie is a small string of text that a web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. Most browsers can be configured to inform you when a web site wants to place a cookie, and you can decide whether to accept the cookie. If you are just browsing the Site, you do not have to accept a cookie and you may still continue your visit. Please consult your browser's manual or help pages for information on how to set this preference. However, access to some portions of the Site may be restricted to registered users. To gain access to such areas you must accept cookies as they are needed for site administration and security.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">E-MAILS AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS FROM US OR OUR PARTNERS</p>

            <p>If you provide ESS with your e-mail or postal address, or have done so in the past, ESS may send you updates on the latest ESS products and promotions. At any time, you may tell ESS to discontinue sending such information by simply replying to the e-mail and informing ESS of your preferences. By providing ESS with your e-mail address you consent to receive all electronic or paper messages and/or solicitations sent by ESS, and in so doing, you waive your rights under all state, federal or local laws regulating the transmission of unsolicited commercial paper mail and electronic mail (including but not limited to The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) and Washington's law regulating unsolicited commercial e-mail (RCW ยง 19.190.010, et seq.)).</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">CHILDREN</p>

            <p>ESS does not solicit data from children. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Site by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">LINKS TO OTHER SITES</p>

            <p>On the Site, we place links to other web sites operated by other parties. Some of these other web sites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other web sites or these other web sites' business practices, and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of these other web sites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the Site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">OUR SECURITY PRECAUTIONS</p>

            <p>The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. In the event you purchase a service through the Site, our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. We encrypt all of your personal and financial information as it travels over the Internet and we store your financial information on our servers in encrypted form. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

            <p>Except as described in this privacy policy, ESS will not disclose your personal information that is collected through the Site to a third party, unless you request or otherwise consent to such disclosure or disclosure is required or authorized by law. (Again, if you access services using a password or log-in, separate privacy practices apply.)</p>

            <p>ESS may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist ESS in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described in this privacy policy. Our service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by us and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this privacy policy.</p>

            <p>Although ESS makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information as follows:</p>

            <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">(i)</span> when required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on ESS;
            <br><span style="font-weight: bold">(ii)</span> to enforce ESS's policies or agreements including the collection of amounts owed to us; and
            <br><span style="font-weight: bold">(iii)</span> to protect users of our sites and our sites from fraudulent or abusive use.
            </p>

            <p>ESS also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of ESS or of any of the business or assets or shares of ESS or a division thereof.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold">UPDATES</p>

            <p>While other aspects of our privacy policy are subject to change at any time and without notice (i.e., we may revise this policy from time to time by posting an updated version), we will never give personally identifiable information about you to third parties without your prior consent. Please check here for updates.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with ESS, you may contact:</p>
