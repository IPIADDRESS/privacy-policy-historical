      such as when you choose to opt-into or opt-out of the sharing of Data. We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having
      your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if you
      purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your
