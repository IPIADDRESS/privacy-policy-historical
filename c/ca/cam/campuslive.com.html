	<h1 class="infotitle">CampusLIVE Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>The web site www.campuslive.com ("the Web site") is provided by CampusLIVE, Inc. ("CampusLIVE").  Throughout this Privacy Policy ("Policy") the words "we," "us," and "our" refer to CampusLIVE and its corporate affiliates.  By accessing or using this Web site or by registering as a member of this Web site, you consent to the use of your Personal Data (defined below) as described in this Policy.  This Policy applies to all users of the Web site, including users who are also registered members.  If you are unwilling to consent to our collection and use of your Personal Data as described in this Policy or to accept the terms in the <a href="/info/terms">Terms of Use</a><span style="color: #000000;"> that apply to use of the Web site, you should not use the Web site.</span></p>

	<p><u>Collection and Use of Personal Data</u></p>

	<p>Your privacy is important to CampusLIVE.  We at times collect, retain and utilize Personal Data about you to operate our business and to notify you of services and other opportunities offered by CampusLIVE or its partners.  The term "Personal Data" means data that can reasonably be used to identify you that CampusLIVE obtains about you, including your name, telephone number, physical address and email address.  We recognize and respect your privacy concerns about this information.  We obtain Personal Data in a variety of ways (for example, as provided by you when you register to use the Web site, or from your other transactions or experiences with CampusLIVE or its affiliates, including comments and information that you submit when utilizing the "social networking" aspects of the Web site). </p>

	<p>We may send promotional email messages to you on behalf of third parties.  We do not share your Personal Data with such third parties, and you have the opportunity to opt out of such promotional messages by "unsubscribing". </p>

	<p>You do not have to sign-up to use the Web site.  However, in order to customize your page and take full advantage of the Web site features, you do have to sign-up.  If you sign onto the Web site using your Facebook account and you agree to allow CampusLIVE to access your Facebook account information, including your name, email address, profile picture, gender, "networks", user ID (but not your password), list of friends, and "any other information I've shared with everyone", CampusLIVE may collect such information.  CampusLIVE will only use such information to make it easier for you to sign onto the Web site.  If you allow CampusLIVE access to such data, CampusLIVE may access that data at any time, including when you are not using "the application".</p>

	<p>Further, when you visit the Web site we collect information that does not identify you to measure the use of the Web site and to improve the content of the Web site, including as described below. </p>

	<p><u>Log Files</u></p>

	<p>As is true of most websites, CampusLIVE may gather certain information automatically through the Web site and store it in log files.  This information, which does not identify you, includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We may use this information to track user habits and improve the functionality of the Web site as a result of our observations.</p>

	<p>CampusLIVE uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Web site in the aggregate so that CampusLIVE can learn which advertisements and Web site features bring Internet users to the Web site, analyze trends, administer the Web site, track users’ movements around the site, and gather demographic information about its user base as a whole.  Cookies are small data files that a website can place on a user’s computer to allow the website to store and retrieve data about that particular user so that the web site can provide or perform a variety of tasks and functions.  CampusLIVE does not link the information it stores in cookies to any of your Personal Data.</p>

	<p><u>Spotlight Tags</u></p>

	<p>CampusLIVE may also use spotlight tags, which are transparent GIF files embedded in the Web site, to help manage and track the effectiveness of online advertising.  Spotlight tags enable the recognition of a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to the Website.  The cookie would be placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with us.  The information that we may collect via spotlight tags and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.</p>

	<p><u>Disclosure of Information</u></p>

	<p>CampusLIVE encourages you to carefully choose the information you submit, post, or provide to others using the Web site or Web site features (e.g., comments, blogs, video chat sessions, etc.).  CampusLIVE is not responsible for disclosures made by you through the social networking features of the Web site.</p>

	<p>Except as indicated within this Policy, we will not sell, rent or transfer your Personal Data to or otherwise share your Personal Data with third parties.  We may share or transfer your Personal Data as directed to do so by you (for example, in setting up a new account).  We may transfer Personal Data to third party vendors who act for us for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented.  For example, sometimes a third party vendor may have access to your Personal Data in order to support our information technology or help compile and manage the data.  All CampusLIVE vendors operate under federal and state laws regarding consumer privacy.  CampusLIVE is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, however, including vendors and third party service providers.</p>

	<p>We may also disclose Personal Data about you as required or permitted by law, including to comply with legal process (for example, we may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation). </p>

	<p>We may, in our sole discretion, share or transfer your Personal Data to protect the security or integrity of our databases or the Web site, to protect our business or reputation, to take precautions against legal liability, in the event of a business transition (see below), to protect and defend our rights or property, for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to your use of the Web site.  We may sell or transfer aggregate data that does not identify you.</p>

	<p><u>Third Party Cookies</u></p>

	<p>Notwithstanding any other provision in this policy, in visiting this site, a third-party advertiser (or its partners) may place or
	recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  These cookies enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you.  To trigger
	these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or "hashed"  (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web
	advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these
	cookies. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to <a href="http://www.privacychoice.org/companies" target="_parent">http://www.privacychoice.org/companies</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_parent">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
