        Information Collected Online About You</h2>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Information That You Provide Us</h3>
    <h4>
        Member Registration</h4>
    <p>
        When you become an evenues.com member you provide your name, address, telephone
        number, email address, a unique login name, password, and password validation. This
        information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including:
        (1) personal identification; (2) to complete space profile; (3) space rental reservation;
        (4) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; (5) to customize
        the content of our website to meet your specific needs; and (6) to make product
        improvements to eVenues.com. In addition, your email address is collected to send
        you an email message confirming your new member registration and each reservation
        you transact online. As a member you will occasionally receive updates from us about
        special offers, new eVenues.com services, and other noteworthy news items. However,
        you may always decline to receive these emails. Please see our Opt Out policy described
        below.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Member Profile</h4>
    <p>
        Members can choose to provide us with venue or space preferences, credit card billing
        information, and other personal information. This information is primarily used
        to assist members in making reservations quickly.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Reservation Orders</h4>
    <p>
        When you book a reservation through our website, we ask you to provide personally
        identifiable information by filling out and submitting an online reservation form
        if you are not an eVenues.com venue provider member already. This information includes
        your name, telephone number, email address, and your credit card number, expiration
        date and billing address. We use this information to process and book your reservation
        and to notify you of your reservation status by email.</p>
    <p>
        We also ask you for personally identifiable information about other people for whom
        you are booking reservations. We use this information only to reserve the venue
        or space, and, if you request it, to send each person an email notification of the
        reservation.
    </p>

        Information Use</h3>
    <h4>
        Cookies</h4>
    <p>
        Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer tied to information
        about you. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session
        ID cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent
        cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of
        time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the Web browser help file directions.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use cookies in several ways. We use cookies to allow you to login without having
        to type your login name each time. Instead, only your password is needed to access
        the system. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you
        can edit your browser options to block them in the future. If you reject the cookie,
        you may still use our website.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Log Files</h4>
    <p>
        Like most standard website servers, eVenues.com uses log files. This includes internet
        protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
        pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer
        the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, diagnose problems with our servers
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are
        not linked to personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that we have links on our website that may lead to other sites.
        These sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy
        Statement does not cover the information practices or policies of such websites.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Communications from the Site</h3>
    <h4>
        Special Offers and Updates</h4>
    <p>
        We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established
        members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals,
        and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option
        to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out
        sections.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Service Announcements</h4>
    <p>
        On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.
        For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send
        users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though
        they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional
        in nature.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Customer Service</h4>
    <p>
        We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in
        regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email, fax or phone, in
        accordance with the user's wishes.

        Legal Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may be required by law
        to disclose information you have provided in obtaining our venue reservation services.
        We may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to our interests
        (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others. In addition,
        it may be necessary for us to provide customer information to third parties, such
        as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the
        normal course of business.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>

    <a name="pesonalyInformation"></a>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Third Party Intermediaries</h3>
    <p>
        We use an outside credit card processing company and bank check processing company
        to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store
        or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Suppliers</h3>
    <p>
        We provide information about meeting venues either reserved or purchased on eVenues.com
        to the venue suppliers who fulfill your space reservation. Although we might offer
        meeting services from caterers, restaurants, photocopy services, office rental services
        and other suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations
        on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission.
        Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any meeting
        suppliers whose products you purchase on eVenues.com. In addition, these meeting
        service suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information
        about your confirmed reservation.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will occasionally share aggregated information with our service providers. This
        information does not contain any personally identifiable information and is used
        to develop featured programs and content that will be of interest to our members
        and website visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may contract a reputable third party to facilitate the distribution of survey,
        promotion, or sweepstakes programs. Upon completion of these projects, all information
        is returned to us.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Affiliated Websites</h3>
    <p>
        If you were referred to eVenues.com from another website, we may provide personally
        identifiable information about you to the referring website. Although we believe
        that the website companies from which you were referred to us are reputable companies,
        we have not place limitations on the referring websites companies from using or
        disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you
        to review the information privacy practices of any website that referred you to
        eVenues.com.
    </p>
    <a name="userChoices"></a>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Choice/Opt-Out</h3>
    <p>
        Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used
        for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for information.
        For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so users who buy a product
        from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address and
        phone number off of our lists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users of our website are always notified when their information is being collected
        by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to
        whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Links</h3>
    <p>
        This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, eVenues.com
        is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
        users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements
        of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This
        Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this website.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Surveys and Contests</h3>
    <p>
        From time-to-time our website requests information from users via surveys or contests.
        Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user
        therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested
        information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address),
        and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used
        to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes
        of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website. Though we may
        use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use user's
        personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
    </p>
    <a name="Security"></a>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Security</h3>
    <p>
        We take precaution to protect our user's information. When users submit sensitive
        information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.
    </p>
    <p>
        When our reservation order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such
        as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the
        best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer (SSL). While on a
        secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
        such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed
        to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect
        user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive
        information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need
        the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer
        service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
        Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure
        environment, in a locked facility.
    </p>
    <p>
        If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an
        email to <a href="ContactUs.aspx">Customer Care </a>
    </p>
    <a name="correctInformation"></a>
    <h2 class="textpage headerunderline">
        Supplemental Information</h2>
    <p>
        In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to users, it is necessary
        for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third party
        sources.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        If a user's personally identifiable information (such as zip code, phone, email
        or postal address) changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide
        a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user's personally identifiable information.
        Members can change their personal information on the member profile page of our
        website. Members and users can all email our Customer Support at <a href="ContactUs.aspx">
            Customer Care </a>or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact
        information listed below.
    </p>
    <a name="notifymaterialChanges"></a>
    <h3 class="textpage">
        Notification of Material Changes</h3>
    <p>
        If we decide to make any material change to our Privacy Statement, we will post
        those changes to this Privacy Statement, the homepage, and other places we deem
        appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
        use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information
        in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was collected.

        email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of
        the changes in our privacy practices.
