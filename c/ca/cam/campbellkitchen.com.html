This website is owned and operated by Campbell Soup Company. Here at
Campbell, we recognize that many visitors to our site are concerned about
the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. So
we've developed a Privacy Policy based on guidelines from the Council of
Better Business Bureaus and our own beliefs about what's right in this
sensitive area. We may update the Policy from time to time, so please check
in occasionally.<p>

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:</p><p>

We'll be happy to answer your questions or hear your concerns.</p><p>

<b>Our Policy</b><br>
At our site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from
individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly.  This
means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order
to view our site. If you register in order to use the "Recipe Box," or "Send
a Recipe to a Friend" features of our site, we use the information you
supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. If you
specifically agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked to be put on our
mailing list when you registered, we may also contact you from time to time.
You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by
e-mailing us at any time. We don't share any information you give us with
anyone outside of Campbell Soup Company.</p><p>

In the e-mail section of our site, we ask for some personally identifiable
information, such as your name, address, and phone number. We use this
information only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to
contact you by e-mail were unsuccessful. We don't use the information
internally for other purposes, and we don't share it with anyone outside of
Campbell Soup Company. We don't use your e-mail address for any purpose
other than responding to the message you've sent.</p><p>

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we
are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases.
If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of
conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). We don't
share the information you give us with anyone outside of Campbell Soup
Company.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. When you
log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new
visitor. The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or
provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any
information from your computer.</p></font><p><font size="-1">
