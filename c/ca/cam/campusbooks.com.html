                <strong> Log Files</strong>
                <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
                <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp; We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information.</p>

                <strong> Cookies</strong>

                <p>We set persistent cookies to store your passwords so you don’t have to enter them over and over.&nbsp; Persistent cookies also allow us to track and build awareness about the interests of our customers.  This helps to enhance a user's experience on our site.</p>
                <p>You can delete persistent cookies by following the directions in your Internet browser's "help" file.  If you choose to reject cookies in general, you can still use our site, but your ability to use some site features--such as contests or surveys--will be limited.
