                <strong> Log Files</strong>
                <p> As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp;</p>
                <p> We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp; We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
