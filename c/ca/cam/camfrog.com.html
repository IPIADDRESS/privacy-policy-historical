        	<h1 style="margin-top: 5px;">Camfrog Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p class="date">December 26, 2009</p>
	
	<p>Your privacy is important to Camfrog.  Camfrog makes it a priority to respect your privacy and to protect your personal information.</p>
	
	<h2>Collection and Information Usage</h2>
	<p>Camfrog collects two types of information about Camfrog users. Camfrog collects personal information
	that is identifiable like an individuals name or email address and non-identifiable information.</p>
	
	<h2>Identifiable Information</h2>
	<p>When registering a Camfrog nickname users are asked to enter their email address and they are also given the option to enter their first and last name. This information is used to allow the user to logon to Camfrog and have access to our services. The information you enter during registration may appear in our public Camfrog user directory. Your email address is pre-checked as hidden by default so it will not appear in the directory unless you specifically allow it. You can change your identifiable profile information any time by going to your Camfrog settings. It is possible to add a photo to your profile by going to the Camfrog settings and this can also be changed or removed. During registration users are asked to input their birthday and sex. Users can also optionally add their occupation, homepage URL, and comments about themselves in their user profile settings. Your information will not be supplemented with information from other sources.</p>
	
	<h2>Non-Identifiable Information</h2>
	<p>Camfrog also collects Non-Identifiable information. For example our website may keep logs of visitors Internet Browser type, Operating System, IP address and other anonymous information. Camfrog client collects your IP address, Camfrog client software version, and operating system version.  Users should be aware that (1) to facilitate moderation of the room, Camfrog room owners have the transitory ability to see the IP addresses of users who join the room, and (2) both static and dynamic IP addresses can be mapped back to users on most ISPs based on the users login time and recorded information.</p>
	
	<h2>Web Browser Cookies</h2>
	<p>The Camfrog website may use cookies to help keep you logged on with your nickname and password
	when you are using our website services. Cookies may also be used to track what Camfrog pages you
	visit so we can better serve you.</p>
	
	<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
	Camfrog does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties except in
	certain circumstances:
	<ul>
	<li>If we are sent a subpoena or some other legal document or government request then we are required to comply with the law.</li>
	<li>If we feel it is necessary to share information to prevent Camfrog Terms of Service violations or software piracy, fraud, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Modifying Personal Information</h2>
	<p>Go to your Camfrog settings and then choose your profile settings to modify your personal
	information. It is not possible to modify some non-identifiable information like your birthday and
	sex.</p>
	
	<h2>Security Measures</h2>
	<p>Sensitive and private data exchange between the Camfrog website and Camfrog users happens over a SSL secured communication channel. All sensitive user data between the Camfrog Central server and Camfrog users is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.</p>
	<p>Camfrog Video Chat Client software is delivered protected with a digital signature to prevent unauthorized executable changes and to protect the Camfrog installer integrity.</p>
	<p>While Camfrog Client users store some personal information on our servers we never keep it in clean text so the data stays protected.</p>
	<h2>Data Retention</h2>
	<p>If Camfrog is uninstalled and your nickname is not used in 1 year then your public profile information may be deleted from the public Camfrog directory. You can change your public profile any time by going to your Camfrog settings so it contains no personal identifiable information.</p>
	<p>Camfrog will preserve your information for as long as is necessary to allow you to use Camfrog services, comply with government legislation, regulatory requests and relevant orders from relevant courts, and fulfill any of the other purposes detailed in this Privacy Statement.</p>
	<h2>Camfrog Toolbar</h2>
	<p>Camfrog has a toolbar that is available for Internet Explorer and Firefox. Camfrog Toolbar will
	make Camfrog search your default search engine. To switch to any other search engine go to your
	browser settings. To uninstall Camfrog Toolbar go to add/remove programs.</p>
	
	<h2>Uninstalling Camfrog</h2>
	<p>You may uninstall Camfrog using the Windows Add/Remove programs function.</p>
	
	<h2>Children's Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p>Camfrog has created this children's privacy statement to explain our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen.<br>
	1. We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally-identifiable information from a
	user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records.<br>
	2. Because we do not collect any personally-identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do NOT knowingly
	distribute such information to third parties. <br>
	3. We do NOT knowingly allow children to participate in online
	activities by requiring or collecting personally-identifiable information.</p>
	
	<h2>Advertising</h2>
	<p>We sometimes use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website and use our software. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
	<br> Camfrog may contain links to other web sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties.  Camshare Inc. and our websites do
	not endorse and are not responsible for the operation of or content located on or through any such third party web site. We do not have
	control over the personal information collection and use practices of third parties and such third party practices may differ from this
	privacy policy. You should review the privacy policy of every web site you visit to ensure that you are comfortable with the practices of
	that particular web site.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Third Party Sharing</h2>
	<p>In certain instances we may also share your non personally
	identifiable information with third party vendors performing functions
	on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) which may
	include but are not limited to the following: <br>
	1. deliver our merchandise <br>
	2. administer our promotions<br>
	3. provide us marketing or promotional assistance<br>
	4. analyze our data<br>
	5. send marketing communications in the form of email or direct mail on our behalf.</p>
	<p>Our vendors agree to use this information, and we share information
	with them, only to carry out our requests. Except as provided in this
	Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the
	information, your personally identifiable information will not be
	shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Policy Privacy Updates</h2>
	<p>Camfrog reserves the right to update the privacy policy from time to time. Any changes that are
	made will be posted to this web page. When the privacy policy is updated the date will be changed
	at the top.</p>
