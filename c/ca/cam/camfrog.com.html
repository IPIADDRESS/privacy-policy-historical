<h1>Camfrog Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="date">February 2, 2007</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to Camfrog.  Camfrog makes it a priority to respect your privacy and to protect your personal information.</p>

<h3>Collection and Information Usage</h3>
<p>Camfrog collects two types of information about Camfrog users. Camfrog collects personal information
that is identifiable like an individuals name or email address and non-identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>When registering a Camfrog nickname users are asked to enter their email address and they are
also given the option to enter their first and last name. This information is used to allow the user
to logon to Camfrog and have access to our services. The information you enter during registration
may appear in our public Camfrog user directory. Your email address is pre-checked as hidden by
default so it will not appear in the directory unless you specifically allow it. You can change
your identifiable profile information any time by going to your Camfrog settings. It is possible to
add a photo to your profile by going to the Camfrog settings and this can also be changed or removed.
During registration users are asked to input their birthday and sex. Users can also optionally add
their occupation, homepage URL, and comments about themselves in their user profile settings. Your
information will not be supplemented with information from other sources.</p>

<h3>Non-Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Camfrog also collects Non-Identifiable information. For example our website may keep logs of
visitors Internet Browser type, Operating System, IP address and other anonymous information.
Camfrog client collects your IP address, Camfrog client software version, and operating system version.</p>

<h3>Web Browser Cookies</h3>
<p>The Camfrog website may use cookies to help keep you logged on with your nickname and password
when you are using our website services. Cookies may also be used to track what Camfrog pages you
visit so we can better serve you.</p>

<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
Camfrog does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties except in
certain circumstances:
<ul>
<li>If we are sent a subpoena or some other legal document or government request then we are required to comply with the law.</li>
<li>If we feel it is necessary to share information to prevent Camfrog Terms of Service violations or software piracy, fraud, or any other illegal or inappropriate activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modifying Personal Information</h3>
<p>Go to your Camfrog settings and then choose your profile settings to modify your personal
information. It is not possible to modify some non-identifiable information like your birthday and
sex.</p>

<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>Sensitive and private data exchange between the Camfrog website and Camfrog users happens over a SSL
secured communication channel. All sensitive user data between the Camfrog Central server and
Camfrog users is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.</p>
<p>Camfrog Video Chat Client software is delivered protected with a digital signature to prevent
unauthorized executable changes and to protect the Camfrog installer integrity.</p>
<p>While Camfrog Client users store some personal information on our servers we never keep it in clean
text so the data stays protected.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>If Camfrog is uninstalled and your nickname is not used in 1 year then your public profile
information may be deleted from the public Camfrog directory. You can change your public profile
any time by going to your Camfrog settings so it contains no personal identifiable information.</p>
<p>Camfrog will preserve your information for as long as is necessary to allow you to use Camfrog
services, comply with government legislation, regulatory requests and relevant orders from relevant
courts, and fulfill any of the other purposes detailed in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<h3>Camfrog Toolbar</h3>
<p>Camfrog has a toolbar that is available for Internet Explorer and Firefox. Camfrog Toolbar will
make Camfrog search your default search engine. To switch to any other search engine go to your
browser settings. To uninstall Camfrog Toolbar go to add/remove programs.</p>

<h3>Uninstalling Camfrog</h3>
<p>You may uninstall Camfrog using the Windows Add/Remove programs function.</p>

<h3>Policy Privacy Updates</h3>
<p>Camfrog reserves the right to update the privacy policy from time to time. Any changes that are
made will be posted to this web page. When the privacy policy is updated the date will be changed
at the top.</p>
