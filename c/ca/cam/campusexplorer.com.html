<h1>Internet Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>At Campus Explorer, Inc. we continue to develop technological enhancements for students, families, schools and our partners. We are committed to excellence in customer service, and your privacy is important to us. This policy is effective on January 1, 2007.  </p>

<h2>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h2>

<p>This Privacy Statement applies to Campus Explorer, Inc. websites and governs data collection and usage at all Campus Explorer sites and services. As part of our mission to expand access to higher education, Campus Explorer hosts innovative websites such as www.CampusExplorer.com.</p>

<p>Campus Explorer provides various online services for other providers of educational funding, test preparation and relocation services. You may access some services provided by Campus Explorer with pages that are co-branded through the site of our partners. It is important to note that this privacy policy does not apply to other areas of partners sites that are not provided by Campus Explorer.</p>

<p>Some areas of our websites may provide links to non-Campus Explorer sites. If you link to a site that is not a Campus Explorer website, the privacy policy of that site and its terms of Use of use apply to you. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policy of any third party before giving personal information to them.</p>

<h2>Use of Personal Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Campus Explorer does not collect any nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us through one of our online services.  Campus Explorer does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. If you choose to register on a Campus Explorer website in order to utilize an online service that requires you to log in, Campus Explorer will collect basic information such as name, email address and brief demographic information. If you choose to submit an online loan application, Campus Explorer will collect information such as your Social Security Number, and that of your endorser or co-borrower, if applicable, date of birth, driver's license number, phone number, and references required for the completion of a student loan application.</p>

<p>We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes, pages visited, product, school and lender codes, IP address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you visit immediately before and immediately after you visit our websites, and other anonymous data involving your use of our websites. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. </p>

<p>Campus Explorer enables you to voluntarily provide personal information to third parties such as college or university admissions departments. This information will not be provided by Campus Explorer to any third party other than the colleges or universities that you select. The selected university will be communicating with you, and the university's use of your data is governed by its privacy policy. </p>

<p>If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about one of our sites, Campus Explorer will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to view the article that you are sending them. Campus Explorer does not store this information, and it is for the sole purpose of sending the one-time email.</p>

<p>If you choose not to remove the check mark from the Newsletter box on your registration form, you agree that Campus Explorer may periodically send you an e-mail newsletter which includes educational or marketing information to the email address with which you registered. If you choose not to remove the check mark from the Offers box on your registration form, you agree that Campus Explorer may periodically send educational or marketing information to the email address with which you registered.  You may unsubscribe to either service at any time in the newsletter or registration areas of the sites, and your information is not shared with any third parties.</p>

<p>Certain processes, such as online loan applications, will require that you provide your social security number and date of birth if you choose to continue with the online process. Once this information is provided, it will be associated by Campus Explorer with the user account that is then logged on, and you will not need to provide it again. Thereafter, you will only need your username and password to access your account information or to complete forms in other processes. For your security, the social security number that you enter cannot be used with any other account.</p>

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law why information from persons who are not yet 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you can utilize the information provided in many areas of our site, but you are not authorized to create an account. </p>

<h2>Updating Personal Information</h2>

<p>You may update or modify basic personal information associated with your account. A link is available on the log-in page to enable you to update basic data regarding your account. </p>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>If you register with Campus Explorer in order to utilize a service that requires you to log in, your user ID will be stored in a temporary "cookie" on your web browser. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server to help us identify you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The cookie that manages your login will be removed as soon as you close your browser. Other cookies that are used are for customization of content and contain no personally identifying information. Our cookies are not used to collect any nonpublic personal information. </p>

<h2>Website Use Information</h2>

<p>Web servers at Campus Explorer automatically recognize your domain name, but not your e-mail address. No nonpublic personal information is collected unless you choose to provide it to us through one of our online services. Our web server does collect information such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited and length of user session in order to compile website statistics that enable us to analyze how our websites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites. </p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>

<p>Sensitive information is encrypted with the latest cryptographic technology.  For security in-house, security procedures are in place to prevent unauthorized access to any user information.</p>

<h2>Passwords</h2>
