<u>Pancake Programming LLC and PancakeMail.com Privacy Policy</u>:<br>
</strong></font>
<font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial" color="#000000">
<br><br>
<ol>
<li><u>Information Collection</u>:<br><br>
Pancake Programming LLC, PO Box 472, Farmingdale, NY 11735 ("Pancake") is the sole owner of the information collected on Pancakemail.com (the "Site"). Pancake collects information from its users as detailed in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
Registration - In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give the following information:<br>
<br><ol>
<li>a first and last name</li>
<li>a username</li>
<li>a password</li>
<li>a password hint</li>
<li>an offsite email address</li>
<li>their city, state and country</li>
</ol>
<br>
Additionally, during registration or at any time thereafter, a user may provide any or all of the following information:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>their opinions</li>
<li>their preferences</li>
<li>their sex, date of birth and mailing address</li>
</ol>

</li><br>
<li><u>Information Use</u>:<br><br>
Pancake uses individual user information to provide e-mail storage, transmission and
receiving services ("E-Mail Services"), and to facilitate the matching of users with appropriate
content on and off the Site.
Pancake maintains aggregate user information (that is, information about Pancake users
as a group without tying information to specific users). This information includes population
demographics, the relative popularity of Pancake’s various forums and services, service sign-up
rates, and the like. Pancake uses this information to market the Site, to help sell advertising on
the Site appropriate for the Pancake user population, to develop services and content for the Site,
and to improve the performance of the Site.
Pancake also maintains information tied to individual users for the purposes of providing
E-Mail Services. Such information is used <i>only</i> for the purposes of providing E-Mail Services.
Pancake does not share this information with third parties.

</li><br>
<li><u>Log Files</u><br><br>
Pancake uses log files generated by software in response to user actions on the Site. The
log file data include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider
(ISP) identification, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and user "click"
statistics. Pancake uses the data to maintain security over their servers and websites, 
analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather
demographic information for aggregate use. Pancake uses a log file analysis program called 
"Webalizer" that analyzes log file data to provide Pancake with general, non-user
specific information about usage trends on the Site. Except when issues of security arise, Pancake 
does not tie log file data to individual users’ profile information.


</li><br>
<li><u>Communications from the Site</u>:<br><br>
<i>Special Offers and Updates</i> - Pancake sends all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify their 
account password and username. Established members may occasionally receive 
information on products, services, special deals and the like. 
Users may opt-out of these services, except the welcoming email, which is required. 
<br><br>
<!-- we don't have any plans for a newsletter
Newsletter - If a user wishes to subscribe the Pancake newsletter, Pancake asks for
contact information such as name and e-mail address. Users may opt-out of Pancake’s newsletter
service at any time. -->

<i>Service Announcements</i> - Occasionally, Pancake may send out service related
announcements, for example, when service is suspended for maintenance purposes or any other 
time the users' service may be affected. The user is not provided with the opportunity to 
opt out of receiving service related email announcements.
<br><br>

<i>Customer Service</i> - Pancake communicates with users on a regular basis to provide
requested services and to address issues relating to user accounts. These communications may be
by postal mail, e-mail or phone, as appropriate.


</li><br>
<li><u>Sharing of Information</u>:<br><br>
Pancake does not share personal information with third parties except:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>when required by law,</li>
<li>when Pancake has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process,</li>
<li>when Pancake has a good faith belief that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect data or property owned, in the possession of or maintained by Pancake.</li>
</ol>
<br>

In the event Pancake goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by
another company, or a sale of assets, ownership of users’ personal information may be
transferred. Users will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal
information. Pancake will notify users when, as a result of any business transition, users’
personally identifiable information will be used in a manner substantively inconsistent with the
terms of this Privacy Policy (as may be amended from time to time).
Pancake users may opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly
related to the Site. Users will be conspicuously presented with the option to opt-out at the point
that the information is collected.<br><br>
Pancake will notify users when their information is being collected by any third parties
providing services in conjunction with Pancake. Pancake does this so users can make an
informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require such third
parties.



</li><br>
<li><u>Links</u>:<br><br>
The Site contains links to other sites. Pancake is not responsible for the privacy practices
of such other sites. Pancake encourages users to be aware when they leave the Site and to read
the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Pancake.


</li><br>
<li><u>Surveys</u>:<br><br>
From time-to-time, Pancake may request information from users via surveys.
Participation in these surveys is voluntary, and users may elect not to disclose this information.
The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping
address), and demographic information (such as zip code). User information collected in surveys
will be used as detailed in a notice provided to users prior to completing each survey. Users may
elect not to participate in any survey.



</li><br>
<li><u>Security</u>:<br><br>
Pancake takes every reasonable precaution to protect its users’ information. User
information submitted to Pancake via the Site (e.g., vie web-based forms) is NOT encrypted for
transmission using SSL encryption.
Pancake’s servers are maintained in a limited access facility accessible only by authorized
Pancake personnel.

</li><br>
<li><u>Correcting and Deleting Personal Information</u>:<br><br>
Users may correct, modify or otherwise update their personal information at any time.
Users may accomplish this via the <i>user settings</i> section of the Site. Users may delete
any optional user information at any time via the user settings section on the Site.

</li><br>
<li><u>Notification of Changes</u>:<br><br>
Pancake will provide notice to users in advance of any substantive change to this privacy
policy. In the event that personally identifiable information is to be used in a manner
inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, individuals will be notified by e-mail and given the
opportunity to opt-out of such use. Such election to opt-out of the use may cause the user’s
account to be cancelled.

</li><br>
<li><u>Contact Information</u>:<br><br>
If users have any questions or suggestions regarding Pancake’s privacy policy, please
