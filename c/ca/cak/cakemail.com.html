All personal data will be used exclusively for administrative purposes so as to offer Clients and Users the required and requested service in good faith.</p>
<h3>Data protection and non-divulgation of personal information</h3>
<p>CakeMail conforms to the rules governing the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and Quebec’s Personal Information Protection Act.</p>
<p>All personal data provided during registration of the CakeMail service will be stored in a secure database and protected with SSL (Secure Socket Layers). This data, including member lists belonging to the Clients of CakeMail, will be exclusively accessible by workstation intermediaries and protected by authentication. Access to this data is only accessible to CakeMail authorized personnel for maintenance and analysis purposes.</p>
<p>Except as provided in this section and elsewhere in this privacy policy, CakeMail will not divulge any personal information allowing a Client or member to be publicly identified without their prior written consent so as to avoid any damage to their personal reputation or their companies or to the intermediaries that represent them.</p>
<p>CakeMail and its Clients promise to never rent, sell or disclose their member lists with third parties without the prior consent of members except in the rare circumstance where Canadian or American law requires it in accordance with a court order.</p>
