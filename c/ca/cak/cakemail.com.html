<h3>Personal information</h3>
Except as provided elsewhere in this privacy policy, Cakemail will not divulge any User’s personal information to any third party.

<h3>Data protection and non-divulgation of personal information</h3>
Cakemail conforms to the rules governing Canada’s <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em>, Quebec’s<em> Personal Information Protection Act</em>, Alberta’s <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em>, British Columbia’s <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em>, and the European Union’s <em>General Data Protection Regulation</em> (collectively the “<strong>Applicable Privacy Laws</strong>”).
All personal data provided during registration of the Cakemail service will be stored in a secure database and protected with SSL (Secure Socket Layers). This data, including member lists belonging to the Clients of Cakemail, will be exclusively accessible by workstation intermediaries and protected by authentication. Access to this data is only accessible to Cakemail authorized personnel for maintenance and analysis purposes. This data will be stored as long as is necessary unless a formal request for its destruction is made by the person to whom it relates.
Except as provided in this section and elsewhere in this privacy policy, Cakemail will not divulge any personal information to a third party allowing a Client or member to be identified without their prior written consent so as to avoid any damage to their personal reputation or their companies or to the intermediaries that represent them. Any and all transfers of such personal data that may be made to third parties outside of Canada will be made exclusively with service providers who comply with the <em>General Data Protection Regulation</em>.
Cakemail and its Clients promise to never rent, sell or disclose their member lists with third parties without the prior consent of members except that Cakemail may disclose personal information of its members in the rare circumstance where applicable law requires such disclosure in accordance with a court order.
Notwithstanding anything in this privacy policy to the contrary, we may share any information (whether personal information or not ) we have collected about Clients, Subscribers or Users or that has been submitted to us: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or demands; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or any violation of the Terms of Use; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that involve abuse of the Cakemail web site infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of the Cakemail web site infrastructure or the Cakemail web site generally); (4) to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Cakemail (in which case we will require such entities to honour this privacy policy); (5) if Cakemail is acquired by or merged with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this privacy policy, or inform all those affected that they are covered by a new privacy policy).

<h3>Gathering of information for statistical and analytical purposes</h3>
Cakemail automatically collects certain information using a third-party analytics program, Google Analytics, to help us understand how all visitors use the Cakemail web site, but none of this information identifies the Users personally. For example, each time the Cakemail web site is visited, we automatically collect IP address, browser and computer type, access times, the web page from which the visitor came, and the web page(s) accessed (as applicable). We use information collected in this manner only to better understand the needs of all Cakemail web site visitors. Cakemail also makes use of information gathered for statistical purposes to keep track of the number of visits to the Cakemail web site and which pages on the Cakemail web site were visited, with a view to introducing improvements.
In addition to Google Analytics, Cakemail also uses KISSmetrics for intelligence and analytics with respect to Clients’ use of the Cakemail service. We only use this service in order to understand how Clients are interacting with the Cakemail web site and the Cakemail service, with a view to modifying the Cakemail web site and to make the Cakemail service more valuable and useful for Clients. In using KISSmetrics, certain personal information may be transferred to KISSmetrics, but only to the extent required for the analytics to work properly. KISSmetrics does not use this personal information for any other purpose, and will not transfer or sell the personal information to any other third party. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://signin.kissmetrics.com/privacy/">KISSmetric’s Privacy Policy</a>. &nbsp;If a Client does not want their personal information used in this way, they may contact us using the contact information found at the end of this policy.

<h3>Consent and identity</h3>
Members, Clients and Users may decline at any time to make personal information available on the Cakemail web site.

Any data not conforming to the rules detailed above will be removed from the Client database by Cakemail within 72 hours. Similarly, permission-based marketing emails shall not be sent to Users who are minors without the prior written consent of their parents or legal guardians.

<h3>Corrections and unsubscribing</h3>
A Client of the Cakemail service may communicate with Cakemail via email at <a href="mailto:support@cakemail.com"><strong>support@cakemail.com</strong></a> regarding access to information submitted during registration and the correction thereof. Members of the Client mailing lists of the Cakemail service are asked to communicate directly with the Client in order to correct or validate any personal information regarding their registration to all permission-based marketing emails. If the Client does not, within a period of 72 hours, respond to a member’s request for access to personal information concerning them or the correction thereof, such member may communicate with Cakemail via email at <a href="mailto:support@cakemail.com"><strong>support@cakemail.com</strong></a>. <span>If a member’s modification requests are not respected by a Client of the Cakemail service, Cakemail reserves the right to impose sanctions on the Client’s usage. Cakemail requires all Clients of the Cakemail service to include a clearly articulated option to unsubscribe from the mailing list in all permission-based marketing e-mails. Clients who must comply with Canada’s Anti-Spam Law have specific requirements for their unsubscribe mechanism. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.cakemail.com/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a>&nbsp;for details. A Subscriber must be able to unsubscribe at any time from a member list generated by a Client of the Cakemail service. The Subscriber may also unsubscribe at the same time from the member lists of any satellite subscriptions of a Client of the Cakemail service by submitting a verbal or written request to the Client. Should an unsubscribe request made by a member not be met by a Client of the Cakemail service within a period of 72 hours, the Subscriber may lodge a complaint directly with Cakemail through the contact section of the Cakemail web site. Cakemail reserves the right to impose sanctions or to suspend service to any and all Cakemail Clients who do not conform to these requirements. A Client may, at any time, cancel use of the Cakemail service following, where applicable, the payment of fees set out in the preauthorized agreement accepted by the Client when registering for the service. Any User invited to participate in a promotional activity organized by a Cakemail Client (viral marketing of the “invite your friend to participate” type) retains the right to refuse the proposed promotional activity. All Clients of Cakemail are held responsible by Cakemail for the proper functioning of all viral marketing tools thereby avoiding an interruption of service. </span>

<h3>Usage of secondary information</h3>
Invisible GIFs and pixel tags are utilized in the permission-based marketing e-mails sent by the Clients of Cakemail so as to permit Cakemail to assemble general information regarding the success of transmission. Once a recipient opens an HTML e-mail sent by a Client of the intermediary services of Cakemail, the computer of the recipient grants access to the Cakemail servers to transmit these invisible GIFs. This tool allows Cakemail to assemble the following information: e-mail addresses and the dates and times of the delivery and opening of messages. This data allows Cakemail to optimize the e-mail delivery and assure that the transmission rules of all permission-based marketing e-mails are being respected by the Clients of the Cakemail service.
Cakemail reserves the right to gather IP addresses in its files for statistical purposes or to test the functionality of Cakemail’s e-mail servers.
