</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how CMI Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a CafeMom, "CafeMom" or "we") collects, protects, uses and shares information about you when you use the CafeMom website (the "Site"). We hope this information increases your confidence in CafeMom and enhances your experience on our Site. Each time that you use the Site, you signify that you agree to be bound by the <u>Terms of Service</u> and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy you must discontinue using the Service and terminate your membership if you are a registered user.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2>I. ABOUT CAFEMOM </h2>
<p></p>
<p>
CafeMom.com is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to set up unique personal profiles and through those profiles to create an online network of other moms and join in conversation. Site members ("Members") can view each other's profiles, communicate with old friends and make new friends on the Site, share photos and videos, play games, create and post in groups, comment on blog posts, and more. To enrich our Members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends.  Site members can change their profile information at any time to manage who can see certain personal information and can control how other Members and CafeMom communicates with them.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
<strong><u>From Members</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
CafeMom collects information from you when you register with our Site, update your profile, interact with other Members and non-Member users, and use various features of our Site. To register with the Site, we ask you to provide your name, birthdate, zip code and email address, and select a screen name and password. Once you are registered you will be given the option to add additional information about you and your family to your profile.
</p>
<p>
We also collect information regarding your activities on the Site, including interaction with other users and your use of the Site. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other similar requests for information and we collect any information you may provide. We collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, games or other promotions offered on our Site. We may also collect information about you through other methods, including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources.
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>From All Users</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Like most standard Website servers, we collect information from all visitors to the Site. We collect this information using a variety of methods, including weblogs, cookies, web beacons, widgets and the like.
</p>
<p>
Cookies we utilize on the Site may include session ID cookies, persistent cookies, or more advanced technology such as HTML5 or Media Stamp. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer. If you reject cookies you may still use the Site but your ability to use some areas of the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of the Site, including playing games or entering sweepstakes or contests.
</p>
<p>
Similar cookies and other technologies are used by our partners, which may also include Flash cookies, which are a form of persistent cookies technically called "Local Shared Objects" (LSOs). Flash cookies are set through a mechanism in Adobe Flash Player. With Flash cookies your data is stored in multiple places and it may be restored once you delete it. Please check with your browser's site on the most updated information on how to delete Flash cookies.  HTML5 or Media Stamp technology has a local storage feature that, when used, allows for quicker access to a website upon a return visit. HTML5 is currently supported by some mobile devices and desktop browsers. HTML5 Media Stamp data is not stored in a browser's "cookies" file.
</p>
<p>
Our Site web pages and our e-mail newsletters contain web beacons (also known as pixel tags). These web beacons allow us and our partners to count users who have visited a web page or opened a newsletter, as well as to collect the other types of information described below.
</p>
<p>
The information we collect through the Site includes, but is not limited to, the browser you are using, the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site, and usage and browsing habits on the Site.  We and our partners also use cookies, pixels and these other technologies to collect data regarding your browsing, engagement and purchasing habits on our Site and on other internet websites.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the foregoing, the Site provides search functionality and we collect the searches conducted on the Site by a user and may combine that information with other information from such user.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2>III. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the information we collect that is associated with a single user or Member, or combined in the aggregate is known as "Data." We keep Data no longer than necessary for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>General Use of Site. </strong>
We use the Data we collect, including both personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-PII in both aggregated and individual forms, to provide the Site, advertising and Site support. We may process and use this Data for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy including, but not limited to:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
Customize, measure, and improve the Site design and optimization, and the content and advertising provided through it, which include research and development;
</li>
<li>
Enforce our Terms of Service and detect fraud and other illegal activities;
</li>
<li>
Let you know about new products or services from us or other companies we work with as well as promotional offers, based on your preference settings;
</li>
<li>
Evaluate potential inclusion in the Site's influencer program;
</li>
<li>
Let you know about changes to the Site, the Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, and other terms that apply to our Site; and
</li>
<li>
Update any programs or other tools that we provide in conjunction with the Site.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition we may combine the Data we have collected with similar types of data provided by third parties for similar purposes. We use this Data to create a better Site and better user experience, as well as to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, to analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may use this Data in these forms for internal business purposes, such as determining how much traffic certain portions of the Site receive, for license reporting and assessment of service levels, to better understand how the Site is used, to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users of the Site, or determining which search queries are the most popular.
</p>
<p>
Using this Data, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Site are the most interesting and what kind of offers our Members like to see.
</p>
<p>
We use cookies to differentiate users of the Site from Members, to customize the content of certain sections of the Site and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site. For example, we may use such Data to determine which blogs, articles, or games to recommend to you. We may also use Data to send you targeted offers and other communications.
</p>
<p>
We may use a Member's registration information to verify that you are the person authorized to use the Site or to manage your account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When You Register.</strong>
When you register with CafeMom, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your screen name and photo, are displayed as specified in your privacy settings to allow you to connect with other CafeMom Members or to all users of the Site. Your real name is never displayed on the Site (unless you use it as your screen name), but your real name will be included in emails that you "send to a friend." You can choose to allow Members and non-Member users to search for you by using your real name or most other information you have entered in your profile.
</p>
<p>
Most of the information you provide to CafeMom in your profile can be set to be seen by all users of the Site, Members only, friends only, or no one.  However, please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all users and cannot be hidden. Specifically, your screen name and photo are always displayed on the Site and therefore are viewable by all users. In addition, because this information is publicly displayed on the Site it may appear in the results of searches conducted on Internet search engines.
</p>
<p>
By using the search functionality on the Site CafeMom Members can find other moms with similar interests and challenges. When you find other Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more about them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing of Information. </strong>
We use third parties to assist us in delivering parts of the Site to you. We may share portions of your Data with these third parties to the extent necessary for them to provide these services. As described in more detail below, we may also provide Non-PII elements of your Data to third parties who deliver ads to you. We will not provide your PII to these advertisers unless you expressly authorize us to do so.
</p>
<p>
We may also share weblog data and other similar non-PII Data with third parties. For example, we may share traffic data for the Site with a third party that analyzes and publishes Website traffic surveys.
</p>
<p>
Posts to the Site are viewable by either all users of the Site, Members only, or group members only (as determined by the group owner), and CafeMom tries to maintain the privacy setting of each group as determined by such group owner. Note that posts may also be collected by Internet search engines, such as Google.
</p>
<p>
You may authorize other Internet sites such as Facebook to access and publish on their websites some of your Data, including your activity on the Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Advertisements.</strong>
We, or our partners acting at our request, may deliver advertisements to you through the Site or through third party sites, as described in more detail below.
</p>
<p>
<u>Members</u>
</p>
<p>
If you are a Member, we may use your Data, regardless of where we gathered such information, to determine what type of ad to display to you on the Sites.  In addition, we may send certain demographic information, like ZIP code, age, and gender to our advertising partners, so that the advertising you see is more relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
<u>Contextual Advertising</u>
</p>
<p>
We, or our advertising partners, automatically deliver ads to all users of the Site, whether they are registered or not, based on non-personal information including: (i) the IP address associated with your computer or location data from your mobile phone for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location; (ii) the type of web page that is being displayed, such as a news or games page, for example; (iii) the content on the page that is shown, such as a news article about a certain movie; (iv) the browser you are using; (v) the operating system and/or computer brand you are using; and (vi) for mobile users, the cellular network you are using. This advertising activity automatically applies to all users and it is purely contextual.
</p>
<p>
<u>Interest-Based Advertising</u>

<p>
<strong>Sale of Business or Assets.</strong>
In the event that CafeMom, substantially all of its assets, or a line of business is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, PII and non-PII of our Members may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our Members may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where CafeMom or an affiliate, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding.
</p>

<strong>Photos, Videos, and Posts.</strong>
As a CafeMom Member you can share personal content. Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally identifiable information may be accessible to Members and non-Members, and CafeMom has no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Monitoring.</strong>
We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the public and private forums, including in-Site Member emails and interactive areas on our Site. Please review our <a href="http://www.cafemom.com/about/tos.php">Terms of Service</a> for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CafeMom Mobile.</strong>
When you provide us with your mobile telephone number to access certain features of CafeMom Mobile you agree that this action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your mobile telephone number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future information about CafeMom's programs and services from us, and in that regard, you hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the business relationship established using the information you provided to us. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We'll send you our email and newsletters.</strong>
CafeMom may send you service-related announcements and emails from time to time. For instance, if a friend sends you a message, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact. We may also use your information to send you e-newsletters, updates and communications about CafeMom. We may ask you which newsletters you wish to receive. You may change your newsletter preferences (i) at any time by simply updating your account, which you can do by clicking on the "Privacy + Settings" button posted throughout the Site, or (ii) by opting-out of receiving future emails as described at the bottom of each communication from CafeMom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sweepstakes and Promotions.</strong>
On occasion, we offer sweepstakes and other promotions in conjunction with a sponsor. By participating in a promotion, you submit to that promotion's terms and conditions including providing us with permission, if required, to share your personally identifiable information with a particular sponsor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Offers.</strong>
On occasion, we are able to offer you special products or services through a relationship with a third party. In those cases, the offer will be brought to you by CafeMom and fulfilled by the third party. If you accept the offer, you will become a customer of the company that is fulfilling the offer and we will not have control over their use of the personally identifiable information that you provide to them when you accept the offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invite a Friend.</strong>
If you do become a Member, not only can you enjoy all of the benefits of membership, but you can also invite other individuals to join by providing us with their first names and email addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential Members, we will send them an email invitation to join CafeMom.  The only way these individuals can become Members, however, is if they come to our Site and sign up themselves. We do not use this information for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal Matters; Safety.</strong>
We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2>IV. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
CafeMom contains links to other sites. It is possible for you to receive information directly from our partners and other companies if you access them through a link on the Site or if you go directly to their Websites. Once you are on their sites, any data that you supply to these partners, for example, to obtain information or buy products directly from them, is beyond our reach and will be the responsibility of each of the linked-to entities and not CafeMom. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Websites or any other sites linked to or referenced on our Site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Security.</strong>
We have multiple layers of security on our systems. We have implemented software and hardware security, including firewalls, data encryption, and private networks intended to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. We use firewalls and intrusion-detection devices that are designed to defend against hackers and notify us if any attempts are made to compromise our network. We regularly review additional software upgrades to enhance our security measures. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong>
Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the address referenced below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A Note to Users Based Outside of the United States.</strong>
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your PII will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may be different than other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an online account to use the Site as a visitor from outside the United States, you will have agreed to the terms of the Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service and you will have consented to the transfer to and processing of all such information in the United States, which many not offer an equivalent level of protection of that in the European Union or certain other countries.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Children's Privacy.</strong>
CafeMom does not encourage participation or visitation by children. Visitors who are known to be under the age of 16 are prohibited from becoming CafeMom Members. CafeMom does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Updating Your Personal Information.</strong>
If you are a CafeMom Member, you can update your personally identifiable information at any time. To do this, just click on the "Privacy + Settings" link listed throughout the Site. However, we are unable to update or delete any of your personally identifiable information that has been shared with a third party as permitted in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Waiver.</strong>
CAFEMOM ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO ANY THEFT, LOSS, ALTERATION OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION LAWFULLY PROVIDED BY CAFEMOM TO THIRD PARTIES, OR WITH REGARD TO THE FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY TO ABIDE BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT THIRD PARTY AND CAFEMOM.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy.</strong>
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Site, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy. We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new services or change existing ones. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal information, or we are going to use any personal information in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change. If you do not consent, your personal information will be used as agreed to under the terms of the privacy policy in effect at the time we obtained that information. By using our Site or services after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy policy. We will use information previously obtained in accordance with the privacy policy in effect when the information was obtained from you.
