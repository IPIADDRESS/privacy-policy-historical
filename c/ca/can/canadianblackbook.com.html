						<h2>Canadian Black Book Online Privacy Statement</h2>
						<p>Canadian Black Book respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. If or when we do need your personal information to provide services you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>
						<h3>Information Collection</h3>
						<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service you requested.</p>
						<p>When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Canadian Black Book to remember your login and password or you are a subscriber to our service(s). In that instance we can determine who you are by correlating you user name with you Login ID, however this assumes you haven't provided your login or otherwise allowed someone else to use your account.  We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the Canadian Black Book website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Information" below for more information.</p>
						<p>Canadian Black Book collects personal information when you register with Canadian Black Book for a Canadian Black Book account, when you use certain Canadian Black Book products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for promotions, or when you submit your personal information to Canadian Black Book for any other reason. Canadian Black Book only uses information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices and applicable laws.</p>
						<p>Access to certain Canadian Black Book web pages require a login and a password. The use of those web pages and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between either you, your employer and Canadian Black Book. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal information may be retained by Canadian Black Book to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.</p>
						<h3>Notice</h3>
						<p>When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. Canadian Black Book will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled "Information Sharing and Disclosure" below.</p>
						<p>If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that information, within Canadian Black Book or to Canadian Black Book's third party service providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>
						<p>We will always give you the opportunity to "opt in" to receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have NOT given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. </p>
						<h3>Cookies and Tracking Technology</h3>
						<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Canadian Black Book's website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.</p>
						<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of Canadian Black Book's website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website.</p>

						<p>Canadian Black Book uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest software updates or other information we think you'd like to hear about from and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. Additionally, your information may be passed to a third party business for the purpose of that business to contact you or otherwise provide information you may have requested. Again, this would only happen if you have knowing selected to have your information passed along.</p>

Your information may be stored and processed in Canada or any other country where Canadian Black Book, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.</p>

We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.</p>

						<p>Your Canadian Black Book account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Canadian Black Book safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, Canadian Black Book uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.
