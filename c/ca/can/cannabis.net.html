                <h2><b>Collection of Other Information</b></h2>
                <p>
                    We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:  
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Through your browser or device.  Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</li>
                    <li>Through your use of the App.  When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</li>
                    <li>Using cookies and other tracking technologies.  Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and similar technologies are used by Cannabis.net, our affiliates and advertising partners and our partners who serve content on our Services. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.</li>
                    <li>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies.  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.</li>
                    <li>IP Address.  Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Services.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</li>
                    <li>Approximate Location.  We may collect the approximate location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals.  We may use your device’s location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content and so that we may serve you the correct version of the application. We may also share your device’s location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. If you no longer wish to have location-based information collected for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by submitting your request using our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cannabis.net/contact-us">contact us page</a>. If you no longer wish to have your location collected or used, you may opt-out by turning this off at the device level.</li>
                    <li>Analytics.  We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.  This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to <a target="_blank" href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>

            <h2><b>Uses and Disclosures of Other Information</b></h2>
            <p>
                We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information.  If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
            </p>
