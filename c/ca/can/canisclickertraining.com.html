<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; keep track of items in your shopping basket; prevent fraud and increase website security. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit and keep track of your preferences in relation to your use of our website.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website.

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small;">We publish Google AdSense interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour on our website and on other websites across the web using the DART cookie. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using Google’s Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/.
