      <p></p><p id="section1" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What is Rogers Media?</i></font><br>
        Rogers Media Inc. is one of Canada's largest media enterprises, including 
        radio stations, "The Shopping Channel", "Rogers Sportsnet", 
        two multicultural television stations in Toronto, and some of Canada's 
        best-known consumer magazines, business periodicals, directories and information 
        products. It is part of Rogers Communications Inc, which also includes 
        Rogers Wireless, Canada's largest wireless voice and data communications 
        services provider, and Rogers Cable, Canada's largest cable television 
        provider offering cable television, high-speed Internet access and video 
        retailing. <a href="http://rogersmagazines.com/mediasites/index.html" target="blank">Click here</a> to see a list of all Rogers Media Web sites.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section2" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>How can I learn more about your official privacy policy?</i></font><br>
        The official privacy policy commitment of our parent company, Rogers Communications 
        Inc., can be found below in the <a href="#sectionP" template="mainframe">Commitment to Privacy</a>. A printed version 
        can be requested. (see "<a href="#sectionc" template="mainframe">Contact Us</a>" below)</p>
      <p></p><p id="section3" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What is personal information?</i></font><br>
        Personal information is any information that is related to you as an identifiable 
        individual. It typically includes such information as your name, e-mail 
        address, or mailing address. It could also include preferences you provided 
        at web sites or other information.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section4" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Does Rogers collect personal information?</i></font><br>
        We retain only information you provide voluntarily. We will ask for your 
        name, address, e-mail address, or other personal information when you 
        register with a web site or order a product or service. You may also be 
        asked for personal information when you enter into contests or promotions 
        sponsored by us or our partners.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section5" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>How does Rogers use information it gathers about me?</i></font><br>
        Rogers collects and uses your name, e-mail address and other personal 
        information to provide you with a product or service that you requested. 
        We may further use such information to develop and customize products 
        or services to better meet your needs and preferences, and to offer you 
        products and services from Rogers, including any companies within the 
        Rogers group of companies.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section6" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Might I be contacted by organizations outside Rogers?</i></font><br>
        Advertisers who use direct mail may ask Rogers Publishing to be able to 
        send through the mail material of interest to subscribers of some of our 
        publications, but in such cases the list is only released to a reputable 
        third party service bureau for the purpose of sending the specific mailing. 
        E-mail lists might be used for similar communications. All such advertising 
        material is reviewed and subject to approval for acceptable advertising 
        content.<br>
        If you would prefer that you name not be provided to marketers outside 
        of Rogers, please inform us. (see "<a href="#sectionc" template="mainframe">Contact Us</a>" below)</p>
      <p></p><p id="section7" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What are marketing preferences?</i></font><br>
        In general, we assume that your relationship with Rogers Media permits 
        us to contact you about our products and services, as well as those of 
        our sister companies in the Rogers Group of Companies. But if you prefer 
        otherwise, we provide clear, easy ways for you to tell us so. These are 
        your personal marketing preferences.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section8" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>How can I change my marketing preferences?</i></font><br>
        You can contact a customer service representative of the Rogers Media 
        property you receive material from, or use their online customer care 
        (if available for that property). If you registered with a password-protected 
        profile at one of our web sites, log in to your profile update page and 
        click the "Update Your Rogers Marketing Preferences" link at 
        the bottom of the page. If you do not have a password-protected profile, 
        you will have to upgrade your newsletter registration. Do this by registering 
        for a password-protected profile with your existing e-mail address, and 
        clicking on the upgrade link when prompted. If you prefer not to register 
        with a password, you can remove yourself from all future marketing e-mail 
        communications by clicking the link found at the end of any marketing 
        e-mail.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section9" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Are there other ways my information will be used?</i></font><br>
        In addition to the cases above, Rogers may use your personal information 
        when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, under circumstances 
        specifically described to you when we collect the information (such as 
        in a Terms of Service or Use agreement), or in the rules of sweepstakes 
        or other promotions. </p>
      <p></p><p id="section10" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What about personalized ads in magazines?</i></font><br>
        Occasionally an advertiser may ask that we print the name of subscribers 
        in their advertisement in our publications. When this is done, the subscriber's 
        name is printed on the ad at the same time that the mailing label is printed 
        on the cover of the magazine, and the subscriber's name appears only in 
        their personal copy of the magazine. If you would prefer not have your 
        name included in such advertisements, please contact us at Magazine Subscriber 
        Service and specify 'Do Not Personalize'.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section11" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Does Rogers protect the privacy of children?</i></font><br>
        The privacy of children is important to us. We will not knowingly send 
        direct mailings, e-mail or other correspondence to anyone who indicates 
        that they are younger than 16 years. Your children should always ask you 
        for permission before sending personal information to Rogers Communications 
        Inc., or to anyone else. Any personal information we gather from children 
        under the age of 16 would be used solely for demographic purposes. </p>

      <p></p><p id="section12" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>How do I unsubscribe from an e-mail newsletter?</i></font><br>
        Every time we send out one of our newsletters, we include an "unsubscribe" 
        link. Simply click on this link and follow the instructions. You will 
        be automatically removed from that newsletter distribution list. </p>
      <p></p><p id="section13" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Can I change or update my e-mail newsletter subscriptions?</i></font><br>
        We have many e-mail newsletters for you choose from and realize your preferences 
        may change over time. If you provided a password when you subscribed, 
        just log on - using your e-mail address and your password - and you'll 
        be brought to your profile page. All your choices are listed here. Simply 
        click on the options provided, and then "Update Profile." If 
        you prefer not to register with a password, you can remove yourself from 
        all future marketing e-mail communications by clicking the link found 
        at the end of any marketing e-mail.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section14" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Can I change my e-mail marketing preferences online?</i></font> <br>
        If you registered with a password-protected profile at one of our web 
        sites, log in to your profile update page and click the "Update Your 
        Rogers Marketing Preferences" link at the bottom of the page. If 
        you do not have a password-protected profile, you can upgrade your newsletter 
        registration. Do this by registering for a password-protected profile 
        with your existing e-mail address, and clicking on the upgrade link when 
        prompted. If you prefer not to upgrade, you can click the link to no longer 
        receive marketing messages at the end of any marketing e-mail.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section15" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>I'm registering on one of your sites for the first time, but my name is here already. How?</i></font><br>
        Virtually all <a href="http://rogersmagazines.com/mediasites/index.html" target="blank">Rogers 
        Media Web sites</a> will begin using a shared web registration service 
        in 2006. Any information you provide at registration for a site is tied 
        to your e-mail address. If you use the same e-mail address to register 
        at another Rogers Media Web site, the associated information will be retrieved, 
        so you don't have to re-enter it.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section16" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Do Rogers web sites use cookies?</i></font><br>
        Yes, some Rogers web sites use cookies. Typically, a cookie is set when 
        you register on our sites. <br>
        A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser's files for our reference. 
        No one else can read this file. Cookies allow our server computer to recognize 
        you when you return to our sites, so you don't have to re-register and 
        so we can retain any preferences you may have given us. If you do not 
        wish to receive cookies, most browsers allow you to be alerted when a 
        cookie is sent to your computer, so you can decide whether to accept it.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section17" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Do Rogers websites record information about my computer or my visit?</i></font><br>
        Rogers collects IP addresses and related information for the purposes 
        of system administration and to create aggregate statistical reports for 
        advertisers. This information cannot identify you personally.<br>
        Browser information (i.e. the URL of the web page you were just on, the 
        IP address of the computer you are using, your domain type, and your browser 
        version) is automatically recorded as part of transmitting information 
        over the Internet. We may use it to help us display information in the 
        best format for you. <br>
        We may develop summary reports for advertisers, to help them better understand 
        our audience and provide advertisements that are more likely to be of 
        interest to you. For example, we may report total number of visitors to 
        our site in general or to specific pages, average length of visit, etc. 
        No identifying data about individuals is reported. <br>
        During your visit to our sites, we may record choices you have made and 
        use this to provide more customized content or advertising. The data does 
        not identify you and is not retained after your visit. This is sometimes 
        called "clickstream" data.</p>
		 <p></p><p id="section17A" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>Does Rogers use "third party advertising"?</i></font><br>
The ads appearing on many of our Web sites are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.
For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click here - <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy">http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy</a>.

		
      </p><p></p><p id="section18" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What about information on public forums?</i></font><br>
        Rogers sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups 
        available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
        in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution 
        when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section19" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What steps do you take for the security of my information?</i></font> <br>
        Our sites use industry-standard security measures to protect data against 
        loss, misuse and interception by third parties. Our security policies 
        are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. However, Rogers assumes 
        no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted 
        over the Internet.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section20" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>How else can I protect my privacy online?</i></font><br>
        Generally speaking, whenever you disclose personal information online 
        there is a risk that the information may be intercepted, collected and 
        used. That goes for information disclosed on message boards, in chat areas 
        - or even in e-mail. Rogers is not responsible if that information is 
        intercepted. You transmit information to anyone at your own risk. </p>
      <p>Co-branded sites and third party Internet sites and services may be accessible 
        through Rogers sites. Third parties may collect information for their 
        own contests or promotions, and may have their own privacy and data collection 
        practices. Rogers is not responsible for and bears no liability for these 
        policies or actions. <br>
        You alone are responsible for keeping passwords and information safe. 
        Be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>
      <p></p><p id="section21" class="body"><font style="color: Maroon;"><i>What happens to information I provide on a contest entry?</i></font><br>
        Rogers uses a variety of contests and similar promotions to increase awareness 
        of our products and services. We generally request contact information 
        so that we can notify you if you are a prize winner. As well, in some 
        cases we may contact contest entrants with product information. Contest 
        entries generally include a way for you to indicate that you do not want 
        to be contacted based on the information on your entry. Because contests 
        may involve co-sponsors outside Rogers who have their own privacy practices, 
        it is always advisable to read the entry form and contest rules before 
        entering.</p>
