In addition, ASCO uses industry standard technology to keep users’ information secure while residing on ASCO’s servers.&nbsp; However, despite these measures, our IT systems could be compromised by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data, by a technological malfunction or by an error by an employee, vendor or contractor.&nbsp; In addition, the transmission of information via the Internet could be intercepted by third parties.&nbsp; As a result, our efforts to protect our data and users’ data from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful and we cannot assure you that the security measures we have adopted will provide absolute certainty.&nbsp; By using, accessing or become a <a href="#registereduser">Registered User</a>&nbsp;of the Website, you agree that ASCO is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort arising from or relating to any breach of our security, circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures, or interception of your transmissions (see <a href="/node/25403">Terms of Use</a>).&nbsp; Any transmission by you is at your own risk.</p>
<p>When you provide PII and credit card information for e-commerce transactions, this information is encrypted using industry-standard <a href="#ssl">SSL</a>&nbsp;Encryption technology before being sent over the Internet.&nbsp; We submit to the appropriate credit card clearinghouse only the information necessary to collect payment. All credit card information retained by ASCO, including credit card numbers if you elect to store them on your account, is compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you.&nbsp; Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards.&nbsp; The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.</p>
<p>Information related to your ASCO membership will be retained unless you contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@asco.org">privacy@asco.org</a> to request its deletion.&nbsp; Other information you provide to us and that we collect from you will be retained for no longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was obtained, or for a period specifically required by law or regulation.&nbsp; Your information will be disposed of in a manner that seeks to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="10" id="10"></a><b>10.&nbsp; How the Interactive Areas of the Website Operate</b></p>
<p>As a service to our users, the Website may feature message boards, chat rooms, and/or other public forums where users can share information or where users can post questions. We may also offer online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.</p>
<p>In addition, you may choose to use certain interactive content, tools, and services that ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself. Some of these tools (like certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain information, while others may store information in accordance with the authorization you provide at the time you use the service or tool. Please be aware of this fact.</p>
<p>Any chat room, message board, forum or similar interactive service is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. ASCO is not responsible for the privacy of information voluntarily provided by a user in interactive areas. You should think carefully before disclosing any PII in any public forum because what you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for purposes unauthorized by you.</p>
<p><a name="11" id="11"></a><b>11. The Oncology Career Center™</b></p>
<p>Because the Oncology Career Center™ (<a href="http://careercenter.asco.org" target="_blank">careercenter.asco.org</a>) is a career site, it gives job seekers the option of posting their resumes to our database. There are two ways to post a resume.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Searchable Submission</span>. You can store your resume in our database, but elect during the registration process to exclude your resume from searches by potential employers. Excluding your resume from database searches means that you can use it to apply for and respond to individual job postings, but employers will not have the ability to search for it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Searchable Submission</span>. During the registration process you will have the option to allow your resume to be searchable by potential employers. Selecting this option permits all parties with access to our searchable resume database to have access to your resume.</p>
<p>You may remove your resume from the database, and change the status of the resume from searchable to non-searchable, and vice-versa, at any time by updating your profile page on the Oncology Career Center™.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the Oncology Career Center™ is an interactive service that uses Cookies and tracking technologies, subject to the policies and disclaimers in <a href="#5">Section 5</a>&nbsp;of this Privacy Policy and in the <a href="/node/25403">Terms of Use</a>. We cannot and do not guarantee that third parties will not, without our or your consent, gain access to our resume database. You hereby expressly (a) acknowledge that registered employers and other third parties who gain access to the database with or without our or your consent may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases, even if you subsequently change the status of your resume to non-searchable, and (b) agree that in no event shall ASCO be responsible or liable for the retention, use, duplication, distribution, or privacy of resumes in these instances.</p>

<p><a name="16" id="16"></a><b>16. Glossary</b></p>
<p><a name="aggregateinformation" id="aggregateinformation"></a><b>Aggregate Information</b>. <a href="#npi">Non-Personal Information</a>, or <a href="#pii">Personally Identifiable Information</a>&nbsp;that has been de-identified, that is combined with similar data related to more than one individual to form aggregated information.&nbsp; For example, the site may add up the total number of people in Peoria, Illinois, (but not their names) who are seeking information about pancreatic cancer and compare that to the number of people in Petaluma, California seeking the same information.&nbsp; This sort of statistical information is called Aggregate Information because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Websites may use aggregate data or share it with third parties so that the information and services provided best meet the needs of their users. Aggregate Information also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Website know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience.</p>
<p><a name="browser" id="browser"></a><b>Browser</b>. Short for web browser, a browser is a software application used to locate and display pages of the Internet. The popular browsers include Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, and Apple Safari. Most modern browsers can present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats.</p>
<p><a name="cookie" id="cookie"></a><b>Cookie (or browser cookie)</b>. A small data file that is stored on the computer you use to view a website. Cookies are placed by that site (“<b>first party</b>”) or by a third party with a presence on the site (“<b>third party</b>”), such as an advertiser using a <a href="#beacon">Web Beacon</a>, and are generally accessed only by the party or site that placed the Cookie on the computer (i.e. a Cookie placed on your computer by ASCO is generally not accessed by any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your computer by an advertiser may be accessed by any site on which that same advertiser has a presence). Cookies can contain pieces of <a href="#pii">Personally Identifiable Information</a>. Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you check a box to ask that we store your <a href="#username">Username</a>&nbsp;on your computer so that you don’t have to enter it each time you visit the site, it’s stored in a Cookie on your computer.&nbsp; Cookies may be persistent (meaning that they are saved on your computer even after you close your <a href="#browser">Browser</a>&nbsp;and may be accessed at a later time) or non-persistent (meaning that they are deleted when you close your <a href="#browser">Browser</a>). Cookies may be “essential” for the use of a website, such as for example session-id cookies, authentication cookies or user centric security cookies, or “non-essential” for the use of a website, such as for example, third party advertising cookies or other tracking cookies.</p>
<p><b>Encryption</b>. The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is one way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or <a href="#password">Password</a>&nbsp;that enables you to decrypt it. This is typically done by so called “secure computer systems.”</p>
<p><a name="#npi" id="#npi"></a><b>Non-Personal Information (“NPI”)</b>. Information that may relate to an individual but does not identify that individual. For example, Web Information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city, and physical location, when not linked with other <a href="#pii">Personally Identifiable Information</a>.&nbsp; NPI may be “re-identified” through certain processes by linking it to PII relating to the same individual.</p>
<p><a name="onlinebehavioraladvertising" id="onlinebehavioraladvertising"></a><b>Online Behavioral Advertising</b>.&nbsp; The practice of using online tracking technologies such as <a href="#cookie">Cookies&nbsp;</a>and <a href="#beacon">Web Beacons</a>&nbsp;to collect information, including <a href="#webinformation">Web Information</a>, about a user’s online activities over time and/or across third-party websites or other online services in order to deliver advertising and content tailored to the user’s interests.</p>
<p><a name="opt-in" id="opt-in"></a><b>Opt-In</b>. An option that allows you to actively indicate your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you “Opt-in” you must provide certain information, usually Personally Identifiable Information, to the website or otherwise actively indicate your choice or preference to participate in the website program. For example, if you wish to receive a newsletter by email from the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i> (<a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org" target="_blank">jco.ascopubs.org</a>), you can enter your email address and choose the type of newsletter by checking a box next to a statement such as: “Yes, I’d like to receive the JCO Newsletters.”</p>
<p><a name="opt-out" id="opt-out"></a><b>Opt-Out</b>. An option that allows you to actively indicate your preference not to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you “Opt-Out” you must uncheck a box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some action to indicate your preference not to participate in a program. Failure to opt-out typically means that you will, by default, participate in the program, feature, tool or enhancement.</p>
<p><a name="password" id="password"></a><b>Password</b>. A secret series of characters, typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and numbers), that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. The user must enter its, his, or her password before the computer or system will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In addition, data files and programs may require a password. A password should be something that nobody but the user could guess.</p>
<p><a name="#pii" id="#pii"></a><b>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)</b>.&nbsp; Information that identifies or is uniquely associated with an individual, such as a name, tax payer identification number, home address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, or credit card number.</p>
<p><a name="pixel" id="pixel"></a><b>Pixel.&nbsp; </b>See the definition of <a href="#beacon">“Web Beacons</a>”.</p>
<p><b>Posted.</b>&nbsp; Defined in Section 4.d of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a name="registereduser" id="registereduser"></a><b>Registered User.&nbsp; </b>Users who register to use particular features of the Website that require registration and, in some instances, the submission of PII, including but not limited to forums, mailing lists, meeting registrations, subscriptions, and other services, as described in Section 4.c of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a name="#server" id="#server"></a><b>Server</b>. A computer that provides services to other computers. A “web server” stores web site files and “serves” them to people who request them.&nbsp; Servers may belong to ASCO or to other affiliated or non-affiliated entities.</p>
<p><a name="ssl" id="ssl"></a><b>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</b>. A security protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private information via the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that’s transferred over the SSL connection. All major <a href="#browser">Browsers</a>, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Apple Safari, support SSL, and many websites use the protocol to transmit confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that utilize an SSL connection start with https: instead of http:.</p>
<p><b>Third Party Managed Pages</b>.&nbsp; Certain pages of the webist, such as registration, job search, journal, and submission pages that are managed by third parties, and from which third party vendors may directly collect PII and other information as necessary for completing authorized transactions, including but not limited to the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i> website (<a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org">jco.ascopubs.org</a>), the <i>Journal of Oncology Practice</i> website (<a href="http://jop.ascopubs.org">jop.ascopubs.org</a>), the Oncology Career Center™ website (<a href="http://careercenter.asco.org" target="_blank">careercenter.asco.org</a>), portions of the Career Opportunities at ASCO page (<a href="http://www.asco.org/about-asco/careers-asco" target="_blank">www.asco.org/about-asco/careers-asco</a>), portions of ASCO in Action (<a href="http://ascoaction.asco.org" target="_blank">ascoaction.asco.org</a>), the Conquer Cancer Foundation Donation page, the TAPUR page, the QOPI page, the Cohort site, abstract submission, meeting or conference registration, voting, and shopping cart pages.</p>
<p><a name="#username" id="#username"></a><b>Username</b>. A name used to gain access to a computer system or program. Usernames, and often <a href="#password">Passwords</a>, are required in shared systems, such as the Internet. In most such systems, users can choose their own usernames and passwords.</p>
<p><a name="usercontribution" id="usercontribution"></a><b>User Contributions</b>.&nbsp; Defined in Section 4.d of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><a name="beacon" id="beacon"></a><b>Web Beacons </b>or<b> Pixels</b> (also often referred to as “clear GIFs,” “pixel tags,” “1-by-1 GIFs,” “Single-Pixel GIFs,” “1 x 1 Pixels” or “clear Pixels”).&nbsp; Pages of the Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons that permit us and/or third parties to collect Web Information during your visit to the Website.&nbsp; For example, Web Beacons may be used to count the number of users who have visited a page or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). Web Beacons send information back to their home <a href="#server">Server</a>&nbsp;(which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser, or some other third party) from the users’ <a href="#browser">Browser</a>, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type of <a href="#browser">Browser</a>&nbsp;that is accessing the site, and information stored in any <a href="#cookie">Cookies</a>&nbsp;on the users’ computer previously placed by that <a href="#server">Server</a>. Web Beacons can also be used to place a Cookie on the users’ <a href="#browser">Browser</a>.&nbsp; Third parties who provide us with web beacons or pixels may have the ability to link the information they collect about you when you use the Website with other information they collect about you elsewhere on the Internet, including but not limited to your PII or information about the device you are using.</p>
