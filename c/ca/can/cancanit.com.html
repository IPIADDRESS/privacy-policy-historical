<h1>Privacy Policy</h1> </div>

<p>CancanIT has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to our visitors' and participants' privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.CancanIT.com. This Privacy Policy is a portion of, and is incorporated into, the Web Site Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
<h4>Non-Personal Information</h4>
<p>During your visit to the Site, we may request non-personally identifiable demographic and profile data, though your provision of this information is optional. We may use this data to improve our Site and enhance your experience. For example, we may use this data to tailor your experience at our Site, show you content that we think you might be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising on the CancanIT Site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.</p>
<p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
<p>As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each Web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes called "clickstream" data, can be collected and stored by a Web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the Web site from which you linked to the CancanIT Site, and in some instances, your e-mail address. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site and how they navigate throughout the Site.

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We take seriously the security for all personal and non-personal information associated with our visitors and participants.
