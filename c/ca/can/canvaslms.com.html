				<div class="newsbox1Ctext1 h1BM force000">California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses that share customer personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to such information-sharing. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose a customer's personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As described in our Privacy Policy, you can opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes by emailing us at privacy@instructure.com. To find out more about your opt-out rights, please review our Privacy Policy or contact us by e-mailing privacy@instructure.com or writing Instructure, Inc. 6330 S 3000 E, STE 700 Salt Lake City, UT 84121. Please note that under California law businesses are only required to respond to a customer making such a request once during any calendar year.</div>
