<p>
a) Any information by which you may be personally identified, such as username, password, first and last name,
email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, resume and contents thereof, job search history,

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
We, or companies we partner with, may contact you based on your interests such as job postings and career development
opportunities. Our Website may require you to provide us with contact information (such as your name and email address)
as you register for our services. For the purpose of identifying users and delivering relevant content and advertisements,

collect or you provide to us as described to our subsidiaries and affiliates, to service providers and other third parties
we use to support our business, but who are all bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential

by law, to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to any government or regulatory request.

We may use other companies as necessary to perform services required for our operations. In the course of providing these
services, those companies may have access to your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Every effort

We want to take the time to remind you to never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details,

intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.
