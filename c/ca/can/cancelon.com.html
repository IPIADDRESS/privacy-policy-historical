<p><span style="font-size: larger;">4) Cookies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">A cookie consists of a piece of text sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the Website.  We may use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the Website and whils you are signed in; and We may use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">All cookies may be deleted from your computer when you sign out or after they reached a specified expiry date or when you close your browser. Some of them may remain on your computer until deleted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of the Website.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about the Website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to the Website is used to create reports about the use of the Website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">Our payment services providers, Paypal, may also send you cookies. Paypal’s privacy policy is available at: https://cms.paypal.com/il/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&amp;locale.x=en_US</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.  For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.  Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;"><br>
5) Disclosures</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;"><br>

<p><span style="font-size: larger;">Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties and we will not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personal identifiable information from our users for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
