We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13, except to the extent we provide services to those visitors on behalf of schools.  More specifically, a school (or a teacher, on behalf of a school) may contract with us to offer our service solely for the benefit of its students and for the school’s system.  It is up to the schools for which we act as a service provider to obtain the parents’ verifiable consent for the collection and use of their children’s Personal Data. Instructure requires schools, districts, and teachers to obtain verifiable parental consent from students’ parents before collecting and children’s Personal Data. If you are a student, do not send any of your Personal Data to us, other than what we require from you when initially registering for any Services. In the event that we learn we have collected children’s Personal Data, beyond what we request during the initial registration for the Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student has provided us children’s Personal Data beyond what is required when initially registering for the Services, or that a student’s school, district, or teacher has not obtained verifiable parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instructure.com">privacy@instructure.com</a>.</p>
