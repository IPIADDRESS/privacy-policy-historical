Donnelley Publishing &amp; Advertising of Illinois Partnership (collectively, "Dex") understand and respect your concerns about privacy.  This notice describes Dex's privacy policy as it pertains to the website at www.DexKnows.com (the "Website").  We may from time-to-time revise this privacy policy, and the date of last revision will be available at the top of this page, so please be sure to check back periodically.  <strong>By visiting the Website, you are acknowledging and accepting this Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of the Website after changes have been posted to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>What information we collect: </strong>Dex may ask for and collect from you personally identifiable information at certain points throughout the Website.  Depending on the information and/or services you request, you may be asked to provide your name, email address and other information.  Once you provide your personal information, you are not anonymous to Dex.</p>
            <p>In addition to the information you knowingly provide, Dex collects the domain names and IP addresses of its visitors, along with usage statistics (e.g., types of web browsers and operating systems used) and browsing history.  This data is used to more efficiently operate Dex's business, promote our products and services and administer the Website.  Dex may combine this information with the personally identifiable information it collects.</p>
            <strong>How Dex uses your information: </strong>Dex may use your information:
            
            <ul>
                <li> To provide you with personalized content. </li>
                <li>To process and respond to inquiries.</li>
                <li>For the purposes for which you provided the information.</li>
                <li>To improve the content and navigability of the Website.</li>
                <li>To alert you to new Website features, special events, products and services, and to deliver newsletters from which you may opt out.</li>
                <li>To enforce the <a href="http://www.dexknows.com/info/site_use.asp">Terms of Use</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.dexknows.com/info/code_conduct.asp">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
                <li>In the future, we may sell some or all or our assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.  In the event of a sale of our assets including our database, customer information will be transferred.  We will require buyers to honor our privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Information Sharing with Unaffiliated Third Parties: </strong>Dex may disclose your personally identifiable information to another entity (i) for purposes of outsourcing one or more of the functions described in the previous section; (ii) to confirm or update information provided by you; (iii) to inform you of important information; and/or (iv) as a part of a sale of assets as described in the previous section.  We may also share your information in response to a subpoena, legal order or official request, when we believe you have acted in violation of the <a href="http://www.dexknows.com/info/site_use.asp">Terms of Use</a> or the <a href="http://www.dexknows.com/info/code_conduct.asp">Code of Conduct</a>, or when we believe that doing so may protect your safety or the safety of others.</p>

This information is usually aggregated (combined with information from many other users), and may include information such as traffic patterns, trends in connection with various types of inquiries, and other information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How we collect information:</strong>  In addition to the methods described above, we may also collect information using cookies, web beacons or similar technologies.
