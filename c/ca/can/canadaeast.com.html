<b>Objectives<a name="objectives"></a></b><br><br>The Company has created this security and privacy statement in order to document and communicate its commitment to doing business with the highest ethical standards and appropriate internal controls.<br><br><br>
<b>Explicit Information Gathering<a name="explicitinformationgathering"></a></b><br><br>You can examine our entire web site by providing the user identification number and password that accompanies your subscription to a Brunswick News Inc. newspaper. Some pages on our website, including Wheels and Personals, may also require an e-mail address to access certain pages. Our web siteâ€™s request-for-more-information forms require users to give us contact information. This information is used to provide information to you when you inquire about our products and services, to ship orders, to bill orders, and to handle related business matters. This information is also used to get in touch with customers when necessary. From time to time, the information gathered through this site will be used to notify you about products and services that we think will be of interest to you, if you opt to receive such notification. The only identifiable information about you that we capture is the information that you knowingly provide to us upon request through either web forms or other means.<br><br><br>
<b>Covert Information Gathering<a name="covertinformationgathering"></a></b><br><br>Our site does not covertly capture information regarding the specific activities of any particular user. We may host third party advertising or other content that may employ cookies or other means to track user activity. Canadaeast.com will not be responsible for their use of such data. Certain pages on our site do employ permanent or session cookies to 'personalize' content. (An example is our Business site, where the user can personalize a series of stock and mutual fund options for display).  Our site does produce reports that permit us to view the activities of our site visitors in anonymous or aggregated form only. We may use cookies or any other content mechanisms to capture or maintain anonymous and aggregate information about users. This information is used only to enhance the relationship between you as a customer and Canadaeast as supplier of content, goods and services. We do not, under any circumstance, provide information about our users to third parties or resell demographic information.<br><br><br>
<b>Precautions For Children<a name="precautionsforchildren"></a></b><br><br>The Company will never knowingly collect personal information from children. If a child sends personal information to us, and this information can be identified as originating from a child, the information will be deleted. We cannot always determine which information originates with a user that is a child. We do not maintain databases about children.<br><br><br>
<b>Information Usage<a name="informationusage"></a></b><br><br>When you disclose personal information to us, that is where it stays. The only exception involves disclosure to the government according to normal business practice, for instance for the collection of taxes, and according to the orders of a court, for example responding to a subpoena or search warrant. We do not sell, rent, trade, lend, or otherwise transfer such personal information to affiliates, subsidiaries, sister companies, holding companies, parent companies, strategic partners, or any other organization. <br><br><br>
