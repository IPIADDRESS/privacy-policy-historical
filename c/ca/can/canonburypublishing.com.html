<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below:</p>
<p>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.<br>
Third parties / editors who have created products in partnership with Canonbury Publishing Ltd<br>
Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers<br>
Government bodies that require us to report processing activities.</p>
<p>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.<br>
We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place:</p>
<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or</p>
<p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</p>
<p>If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place.</p>
<p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;DATA SECURITY&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We have put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, altered, disclosed, or accessed without authorisation. We also allow access to your personal data only to those employees and partners who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they must keep it confidential.</p>
<p>We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;DATA RETENTION&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.</p>
<p>For tax purposes the law requires us to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Under data protection laws you have rights in relation to your personal data that include the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
