            <p class="bodycopy">RegistrarsAsia's primary concern is to ensure 
              the security of your personal information and credit card details. 
              Through the security features RegistrarsAsia have put in place, 
              we can provide you with a secure method to shop on the Internet.</p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Why Is RegistrarsAsia Safe?</p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We use the latest Thawte SSL (secure socket layer) 
              128 Bit encryption to ensure all your personal and credit card details 
              are safe. Your payment is processed by Worldpay and is secure at 
              all times, your credit card details are made available to Worldpay 
              only. The system is industry standard and best software available 
              today for secure e-commerce transactions. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">RegistrarsAsia Privacy Policy</p>
            <p class="bodycopy">RegistrarsAsia will NOT release your personal 
              information (e.g., your name and e-mail address) to any third party 
              without your permission. RegistrarsAsia will comply, however, with 
              any disclosure requirements imposed by law. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Information Collection and Use </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">RegistrarsAsia is the sole owner of the information 
              collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information 
              to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 
              RegistrarsAsia collects information from our users at several different 
              points on our website. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Registration </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">During registration a user is required to give 
              their contact information (such as name and email address). This 
              information is used to contact the user about the services on our 
              site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for 
              the user to provide demographic information (such as income level 
              and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized 
              experience on our site. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Order </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We request information from the user on our order 
              form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and 
              shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, 
              expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes 
              and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing 
              an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with 
              the user. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Cookies </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s 
              hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie 
              is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while 
              on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply 
              terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user 
              would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving 
              time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still 
              use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be 
              limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not 
              be able to participate in any of our Contests or monthly Drawings 
              that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target 
              the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
            </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">Some of our business partners use cookies on our 
              site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or 
              control over these cookies. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Log Files </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer 
              the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic 
              information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally 
              identifiable information. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Sharing </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We will share aggregated demographic information 
              with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal 
              information that can identify any individual person. </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, 
              and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and 
              services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally 
              identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We partner with another party to provide specific 
              services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share 
              names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third 
              party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to 
              use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of 
              providing these services. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Links </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">This web site contains links to other sites. Please 
              be aware that RegistrarsAsia is not responsible for the privacy 
              practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware 
              when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each 
              and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
              This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by 
              this Web site. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Newsletter </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, 
              we ask for contact information such as name and email address. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Surveys &amp; Contests </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">From time-to-time our site requests information 
              from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys 
              or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a 
              choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
              requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping 
              address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). 
              Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award 
              prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
              or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Tell-A-Friend </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">If a user elects to use our referral service for 
              informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s 
              name and email address. RegistrarsAsia will automatically send the 
              friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. RegistrarsAsia 
              stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time 
              email. The friend may contact RegistrarsAsia at <a href="http://www.registrarsasia.com/">http://www.registrarsasia.com/</a> 
              to request the removal of this information from the database. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Security </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">This website takes every precaution to protect 
              our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information 
              via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 
            </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">When our registration/order form asks users to 
              enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information 
              is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software 
              in the industry – 128 bit SSL. While on a secure page, such 
              as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such 
              as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, 
              as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. 
              To learn more about SSL, follow this link<a href="http://www.thawte.com"> 
              http://www.thawte.com</a> </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive 
              information online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
              user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not 
              just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in 
              our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform 
              a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
              representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
              Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they 
              leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password 
              to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees 
              are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every 
              quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees 
              are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, 
              and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is 
              protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable 
              information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked 
              cage. </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">If you have any questions about the security at 
              our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@registrarsasia.com">security@registrarsasia.com</a>

            <p class="small_heading_green">Special Offers </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We send all new members a welcoming email to verify 
              password and username. Established members will occasionally receive 
              information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. 
              Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option 
              to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice 
              and opt-out below. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Site and Service Updates </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We also send the user site and service announcement 
              updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, 
              which contain important information about the service. We communicate 
              with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues 
              relating to their account via email or phone. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Correction/Updating Personal Information: 
            </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">If a user’s personally identifiable information 
              changes (such as your post code), or if a user no longer desires 
              our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update 
              or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can 
              usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our 
              Customer Support. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Choice/Opt-out </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ 
              of having their information used for purposes not directly related 
              to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, 
              our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who 
              buy a product from us, but don’t want any marketing material, 
              can keep their email address off of our lists. </p>
            <p class="bodycopy">Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter 
              or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving 
              these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line 
              in the email or email us at <a href="mailto:support@registrarsasia.com">support@registrarsasia.com</a>

              information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this 
              so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should 
              proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. </p>
            <p class="small_heading_green">Notification of Changes </p>
            <p><span class="bodycopy">If we decide to change our privacy policy, 
              we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always 
              aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, 
              if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally 
              identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
              at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an 
              email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
              information in this different manner. We will use information in 
              accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was 
              collected. </span></p>
