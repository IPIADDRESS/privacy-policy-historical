<h2><a id="general">A.&nbsp;General Statement</a></h2>

<p>1.&nbsp;CanLII treats personal data about
CanLII Web site visitors with the utmost confidentiality and scrupulously
abides by Canadian law pertaining to personal data protection.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;Furthermore, CanLII adheres to the
principles of openness and transparency that underlie the Canadian legislative
and judiciary processes and recognizes their fundamental importance in a
democratic society.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;The following privacy policy is an
integral part of CanLII’s Terms and Conditions of Use, available at &lt;<a href="http://www.canlii.org/conditions_en.html">http://www.canlii.org/conditions_en.html</a>&gt;. 
CanLII reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy occasionally.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;Any requests or comments regarding the content or the
application of the following Privacy Policy should be directed to CanLII’s Privacy Policy
Officer at the following address:</p>

<div class="address"><img src="img/priv_en.jpg"></div>

<h2><a id="userdata">B.&nbsp;CanLII User Data</a></h2>

<p>5.&nbsp;Any CanLII user data gathered is
deemed confidential. CanLII user information is only gathered for purposes of
establishing statistics about visits to the site and for improving the services
provided, such as Web site navigation, the CanLII search engine, the CanLII feedback
form and mailing lists managed by CanLII. All personal CanLII user data
gathered is never used to either identify or try to identify individuals. CanLII
user data is never divulged to third parties without the CanLII user’s explicit
consent, except (1) when required by law or (2) in cases where unauthorized or
abusive use of the CanLII resource has been made. Further details on
unauthorized or abusive usage of CanLII may be found in <a href="conditions_eng_1.doc">CanLII’s Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>CanLII User Visit Information</h3>

<p>6.&nbsp;Technical information about
access, navigation and searches performed by CanLII users is automatically
logged and retained. Such information pertains to the user’s computer and to the
computer’s of the Web site. More specifically, this information consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The computer’s IP address and its corresponding domain name;</li>
<li>The computer’s operating system and the Web browser used;</li>
<li>The referring site address, if CanLII was accessed from another site;</li>
<li>The query made on the referring site’s search engine, when applicable;</li>
<li>The addresses of the pages visited on CanLII;</li>
<li>The date, time and duration of the visit;</li>
<li>&nbsp;The queries made on CanLII’s search engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.&nbsp;Any analysis of this data is
strictly for improving the technical quality of the services provided and
to evaluate the number of visits to the CanLII Web site.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>8.&nbsp;Navigating the CanLII website does
not require the use of cookies. However, in order to allow for easier and
customized user navigation CanLII creates and saves cookies files on a user computer
when, for instance, the user checks a box displaying a message such as “Do not display
this warning anymore” or “Save these settings as the default values”. When a
cookies file is created, the cookie only contains the information required for
the technical features described in these messages, with no personal user data.</p>

<h3>Feedback Form</h3>

<p>9.&nbsp;When a user completes the CanLII <a href="http://www.canlii.org/feedback/commentaires.html">feedback
form</a>, the user has the option of providing
his/her name, an organization name and an e-mail address. Such information is
collected only for the purposes of addressing the user’s particular concern or
comment and to follow-up on requests received at CanLII through this form. Names
and e-mail addresses are never added to any mailing list and are duly deleted immediately
after the user request or comment has been addressed.</p>

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>10.&nbsp;A user subscribing to a mailing
list on CanLII (the “subscriber”) must provide a valid e-mail address and has the
option of providing a name. Mailing list user data is collected only for the management
and operation of these lists. The subscriber can consult or modify their
mailing list information by following the instructions found on CanLII’s <a href="subscription.html">mailing lists page</a>. Personal CanLII mailing list subscriber
data is destroyed when the subscriber unsubscribes from the list.</p>

<h3>Personal Data Security</h3>

<p>11.&nbsp;Information collected about CanLII
users and their computers is maintained in a secure environment. CanLII personnel
are strictly bound to ensure the confidentiality of any personal CanLII user data.</p>

<p>12.&nbsp;CanLII strives to maintain a
consistently high level of security to ensure the confidentiality of CanLII
user data. However, except in cases of intentional or gross fault, CanLII
declines all liability for any damage or harm caused by any third person
managing to access any such stored data.</p>

<h2><a id="documents">C.&nbsp;Personal Information Contained Within Published Documents</a></h2>

<p>13.&nbsp;CanLII publishes documents as
received from decision issuing institutions, that is, official printers, courts
and tribunals, or law societies. These documents are already of a public
nature. CanLII considers that the complete and unabriged dissemination of these
documents, including any personal information these documents contain, is
paramount to the realization of the principle of openness governing public
institutions in Canada.</p>

<p>14.&nbsp;CanLII does not systematically
examine the content of statutes, regulations or decisions published on its Web
site and does not edit or modify the content of any document. The only document
modifications pertain to the format of received documents as required by document
conversion or other form of computer treatment.</p>

<p>15.&nbsp;In order to minimize the
prejudicial impact on individuals resulting from the wide access to documents
containing personal information, CanLII is actively involved in the advancement
of standards and formal guidelines that promote an optimal level of privacy
protection.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Contained in Decisions</h3>

<p>16.&nbsp;Canadian courts and tribunal decisions are meant to
be of a public nature. This fundamental characteristic of the Canadian judicial
system protects the impartiality of the judiciary, ensures the equity of the
judicial system and allows for citizens and their legal representatives, in
their own legal proceedings, to base themselves upon precedents set by judges. CanLII
respects the public nature of decisions and publishes the complete and
unabriged textual content of these documents, including any possible personal
information contained within these decisions.</p>

<p>17.&nbsp;CanLII and its partners cannot be
held liable for prejudice caused by the lawful publication of any public
document containing personal information on the CanLII Web site, nor by the
eventual dissemination or re-use of these public documents by a third person.</p>

<p>18.&nbsp;In certain exceptional cases, the
principle of complete and unabriged publication of decisions is waived by law. In
these cases, the law prohibits the disclosure of some pieces of information
such as information that would allow for the identification of certain
participants in the judicial system. CanLII abides by these legal restrictions
on publication, in collaboration with the decision issuing institutions.</p>

<h3>Decision Indexing and Storage</h3>

<p>19.&nbsp;CanLII does not allow search
engines to index the content and case names of any trial decision and most appeal decisions
published on the CanLII Web site.</p>

<p>20.&nbsp;Moreover, CanLII prohibits the
storage of any decision available on the CanLII Web site when such stored decisions
could be publicly accessible.</p>

<p>21.&nbsp;CanLII uses all the technological
tools and methods currently available to prevent the external indexing or
storage of its decision collections by search engines. Nonetheless, CanLII and
its partners cannot be held liable for any situation wherein a third party
manages to override the measures taken at CanLII.</p>

<h3>Requests regarding the Content of Published
Documents</h3>

<p>22.&nbsp;Any request regarding the content
of a document published on the CanLII Web site must be sent to CanLII’s Editor
or Privacy Policy Officer. CanLII decides whether a document should remain, be
replaced or removed from the CanLII Web site only after having obtained the
advice from the registrar or other authorized officer of this document’s
issuing institution.</p>
