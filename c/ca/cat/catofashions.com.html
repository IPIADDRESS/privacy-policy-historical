              Online  information is protected by the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.  You can check the security of your connection by looking at the lower left-hand  corner of your browser window after accessing the server. An unbroken key or a  closed lock (depending on your browser) means the SSL is active and the server  is secure. You can also look at the URL address. If the first characters of the  site address change from "http" to "https," then you have  accessed a secure server.</p>
            <p> Some firewalls  and versions of browsers do not allow communication through secure servers. In  that case, you won't be able to process your information through an insecure  connection.
