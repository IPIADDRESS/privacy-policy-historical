Accordingly, we prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern the Website and Services (the <em>"Privacy Policy"</em>). We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information may be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect your privacy. We have organized this Privacy Policy by major processes and areas so that you can quickly link to the information of most interest to you. The bottom line is that meeting your needs and expectations forms the foundation of everything we do, including protecting your privacy.</p><p><strong>Changes in Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>We want you to always be aware of what personal and other information we collect, how we use that information, and under what circumstances we may disclose it. All personal information that we collect will be handled according to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is collected. If the Privacy Policy changes in any significant respect in the meantime, we will not (without your permission) use your personal data in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time your information was collected.</p><p>From time to time, we may find the need to make changes to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be amended by Catch.tube upon notice given through the Website or via e-mail. Please check the Privacy Policy published on this Website regularly to ensure that you are aware of all terms governing your use of this Website.</p><h2><strong>A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></h2><p><strong>Information We Collect Through the Website</strong></p><p>This Website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information.</p><p>When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect this information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on the Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs. However, this information is not associated with any personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.</p><p>When you use the Website, Catch.tube or trusted third parties authorized by Catch.tube may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer (also known as environmental variables) to facilitate your use of the Website and the Services enabled thereby. When you browse the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to Catch.tube every time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular Web page you visited, the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version that you are using to access the Website. All of this information may be collected by Catch.tube and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p><p><strong>User Content</strong></p><p>Users may be permitted to upload certain content onto the Website and Services (<em>"User Content"</em>). This information shall be private and, except in accordance with this Privacy Policy, will not be disclosed to third parties without your prior permission.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, some of the data collected from you in connection with your use of this add-on/extension/app, as applicable, is shared or otherwise made available to third parties with whom we are affiliated or contracted with to provide analytical data and/or improve user experience, and is collected, stored and used in accordance with the third-party privacy policy set forth at: http://addons-privacy.com/</p><p><strong>Providing Your Information to CatchTube</strong></p><p>You never have to provide personally identifiable information to Catch.tube. However, should you choose to withhold certain required information, Catch.tube may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Services. Some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory or optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, you may not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase. Catch.tube will inform you of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required information.</p><p>Catch.tube is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website and Services. Catch.tube will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on us and the subsequent legislation adopted in the United States.</p><p>You may be provided an opportunity on the Website to allow Catch.tube to contact you from time to time regarding company news and product or Services updates. In order to do so, you may be required to provide certain personally identifiable information to Catch.tube. Catch.tube will treat this information in accordance with the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>When you submit personal information to Catch.tube through the Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Catch.tube and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Catch.tube. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p><p>Catch.tube may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from the Website or from other websites that are linked to the Website. Typically, these providers would offer services that Catch.tube customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website and Services. In order to use these services, you may be required to provide personal information to the services providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on the Website in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. For instances, credit card information entered as part of the filling out the purchase form or registration process is collected by the third parties registration services and subject to their respective privacy policies. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Catch.tube personal information collected from you. In such instances, Catch.tube may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>User Account</strong></p><p>Some of the Services offered to users of the Website require you to register for a user account with Catch.tube (<em>"User Account"</em>). When registering for a User Account, Catch.tube will ask you to voluntarily supply SaveFrom with certain information about yourself, such as your first and last name and e-mail address.
