			<p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for the CatholicMingle.com website. The purpose of this statement is to notify you of what personally identifiable information of yours will be collected and/or tracked by the CatholicMingle.com site, how it will be used, and what options are available to you regarding the collection, correction and/or deletion of information.<br>
<br>
ABOUT CATHOLICMINGLE.COM AND THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br>
<br>
CatholicMingle.com is a membership-based online personals service designed to provide an easy way for our members to meet each other on the Web. To accomplish this, our members create their own unique profiles and our technology provides them matches based on their pre-selected criteria. In order to do this, we must ask for certain personal information, which may or may not include: customer-specified CatholicMingle.com username, gender, age, ethnic background, appearance, religion, occupation, preference/lifestyle information and general geographic location. This information is used by visitors for searching and matching purposes.  Much of this information is optional, and meant to be seen by members.  Public information supplied by the user is intended to be viewed by visitors to the site. Public information cannot be used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc.<br>
<br>
To process subscriptions, we may require information that includes, but is not limited to: email address, first name, last name, birth date, credit card number or checking account information for payment, a user-specified password, mailing address, zip code and telephone number. You will be notified of subscription renewal transactions when they occur.  We primarily use email addresses submitted by members to verify enrollment and when forwarding anonymous e-mails from ad responders. Respondees' email addresses are not disclosed to the responder. We may also use a user's email address to send news regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type by contacting us. Email addresses may also be used in private correspondence with the user for customer service issues. All other private information submitted by the user is confidential and will not be disclosed except as required by law or to protect members of CatholicMingle.com. All private information can be updated or deleted by the user at any time.<br>
<br>
AGGREGATE INFORMATION NOT DIRECTLY SUBMITTED BY USERS TO CATHOLICMINGLE.COM<br>
<br>
This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all users to the site. CatholicMingle.com also logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session. This gives CatholicMingle.com an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.<br>
<br>
Except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card or check transaction unless required by law or for the protection of your membership.<br>
<br>
We have contracted with Overture services, Inc. ("Overture") to monitor certain pages of our Web site for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our site. Where authorized by us, Overture may use cookies, Web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics on our Web site visitors.

Contact and other information collected for contests will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information collected will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.<br>
