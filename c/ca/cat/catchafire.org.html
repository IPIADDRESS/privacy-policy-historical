      #### Our Commitment to Privacy
<p>
	Catchafire is committed to protecting your privacy and will make reasonable efforts to provide 
	a safe and secure user experience.  This privacy policy (the "<b>Privacy Policy</b>") sets forth the 
	online data collection and usage policies that apply to www.catchafire.org (the "<b>Site</b>").  The Privacy 
	Policy does not apply to information we collect in any other manner (e.g., email, phone calls, or written 
	documents).  Please note that your use of the Site and its services is subject to our Terms of Use which 
	you may access from our homepage or other Site pages by clicking on Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
	By accessing and using the Site, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by the Privacy 
	Policy and Terms of Use.  If you do not agree with the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, you should not 
	access or use the Site for any purpose.  We reserve the right to terminate or limit your access to the 
	Site for any violation of the Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, or for any other reason, in our sole discretion.
</p>

<div><b>Scope of the Privacy Policy</b></div>
<p>
	The Privacy Policy applies to all information you provide to Catchafire through the Site.  We are not 
	responsible for the data collection, privacy practices, or policies of any third-party websites that we may 
	link to or that may link to the Site and over which we do not have full control.
</p>

<div><b>What Information We Collect</b></div>
<p>
	We generally collect two types of information—personally identifiable information (“<b>PII</b>”) and non-personally 
	identifiable information (“<b>Non-PII</b>”).  PII is any information that can be used to specifically identify you 
	as an individual.  For example, you may submit and we may collect your name, email address, address, phone 
	number, or similar information through the Site.  Non-PII consists of information that does not specifically
	 identify you.  The following section describes how we collect and use your PII and Non-PII.
</p>

<div><b>How We Collect and Use Information</b></div>
<div style="text-decoration:underline">Cookies and Beacons</div>
<p>
	Like all websites, we use cookies and other technologies, including web beacons, so that we can enhance your user
	experience.  Web beacons and cookies collect information such as URLs you came from and go to, your browser and 
	OS information, your IP address, your mobile provider, your mobile device, and your ISP.  None of the information 
	collected by our cookies or web beacons is PII.
</p>
<p>
	Cookies are bits of data placed on your hard drive when you visit websites.  A cookie file contains information 
	that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account's privacy.  We use cookies to maintain your identity 
	between sessions so that the Site can be personalized based on your preferences or history.  We may also use 
	cookies to track information about which pages you visit within the Site to help us gauge the effectiveness of the 
	Site or our content.  We may also store other information such as recent searches in your session.  We use cookies 
	to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor, and to help us understand 
	what areas of the Site are of greatest interest to you.  Cookies also may enhance your online experience by saving 
	your preferences and password so you do not have to re-enter this information each time you visit the Site.
</p>
<p>
	Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to stop accepting new cookies, to 
	notify you when you a new cookie is received, and to disable existing cookies.  If you choose to disable cookies in 
	your browser, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all the Site’s features.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Log Files</div>
<p>
	When you are using the Site, we automatically gather basic information from your browser, such as IP address, browser 
	type, ISP, OS, and date/time stamps to analyze trends, administer the site, analyze bugs, and gather broad demographic 
	information.  We do not share log files externally.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Information About You</div>
<p>
  When you register to our service, you provide a variety of information to help us match you with the best possible 
	volunteer or volunteer experience.  We display some of this information on our site publicly (such as name, location, 
	and profile) and this information is displayed to all registered users of the Site.  We will not publicly display any 
	of your contact information, professional experience, skills, cause interests, or volunteer biography.  Entities with 
	whom you have been matched or other parties that you have authorized, however, will be able to view this information.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Information From Other Web Sites</div>
<p>
	When associating your Catchafire account with other Internet services, we will collect information about you from your
	 accounts on those websites.  We collect this information to help us improve our ability to match you with a volunteer 
	 or volunteer opportunity and to improve your overall user experience on the Site.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Email/Telephone</div>
<p>
	When you register for our services we require an email address that may be used for communications.  Email messages 
  may contain code that helps our systems track your usage of these emails, including what links were clicked.  If you 
	would rather not receive promotional email from us, please see the Choice section below.  We reserve the right to send 
	you email regarding service announcements, administrative messages, and Privacy Policy or Terms of Use changes.
</p>
<p>
	We may also contact you by telephone solely in connection with Catchafire services.  If you would rather not receive 
	phone calls from us, please remove your phone number from your profile.
</p>

<div><b>Disclosure of Your Information to Others</b></div>
<div style="text-decoration:underline">Opt-In Requirement</div>
<p>
	Without your affirmative consent, we will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your PII with other third parties, unless 
	required as described under the Required Disclosures section below.  In the case of posting a volunteer opportunity and 
	accepting a volunteering match, we regard this as affirmative consent and will disclose your PII with the matched party.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may use third party suppliers and service providers to facilitate our services, and 
	they may have access to your PII.  For example, we may outsource one or more aspects of our Site to a supplier or 
	service provider who performs services according to our requirements.  Although we endeavor to select only reputable 
	companies who share our commitment to privacy and will restrict how these suppliers or service providers may use or 
	disclose the PII to which they have access, we are in no way responsible for such third parties or their activities.
</p>
<p>
  Due to factors beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your information will not be disclosed to third parties.  
	For example, third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your information.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Search Engines and Web Crawlers</div>
<p>
	Certain PII that you provide through the registration process (such as name, location, and profile image) may be 
	accessible and made public through syndication programs, search engines, crawlers, and other similar programs.
</p>

<div style="text-decoration:underline">Required Disclosures</div>
<p>
	We make every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy, but may need to disclose your PII when required by law
	or if we have a belief that such action is necessary to:
	</p><ol>
		<li>
			enforce the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use;
		</li>
    <li>
      comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or
    </li>
    <li>
      protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Catchafire, its members, or others.
    </li>
	</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
	You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or government officials as we, in our 
	sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with any investigation of illegal activity or that 
	may expose us to liability.
</p>

<div><b>How to Review and Change Information</b></div>
<p>
	You may control the information you provide to us in various ways.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to change any of your information in our database, you can do so by logging onto your account and 
	following the directions.
</p>
<p>
	To cancel your account, send an email request to 
	<a href="mailto:catchus@catchafire.org">catchus@catchafire.org</a> from the email address you provided us 
	in your registration.
</p>

<div><b>Age Restrictions</b></div>
<p>
	Any person who provides information through the Site represents that they are 13 years of age or older.  
	We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13.  In compliance with the Children’s Online 
	Privacy Protection Act, any information we receive from users we believe to be under the age of 13 will be 
	purged from our database.  If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under age 13 who you believe 
	has submitted personal information to the Site, please contact us immediately.
</p>

<div><b>Choice</b></div>
<p>
	You may use the Email Preferences features on the Site to opt-out of notificaions, promotional email and newsletters.  
	You will also have the ability to opt-in in the event that we share your information with other third-party 
	organizations for their marketing or promotional uses or various other programs or features.
</p>

<div><b>Contacting Us</b></div>
<p>
	If you have any questions or comments about the Privacy Policy, the practices of the Site, or your experiences
	 with the Site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:catchus@catchafire.org">catchus@catchafire.org</a>.
</p>

<div><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b></div>
<p>
	We reserve the right to change or update the Privacy Policy at any time, and will notify users of the Site by 
	posting such changed or updated Privacy Policy on this page.  Under certain circumstances, we may also elect to 
	notify you of changes or updates to the Privacy Policy by additional means, such as by posting a notice on the 
	homepage of the Site or by sending you an email.  Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting 
	to the Site and will be reflected by the Effective Date below.  Continued use of the Site following any changes 
	shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to the Privacy Policy and any future revisions.
</p>

<div><b>Security</b></div>
<p>
	To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting profile access.  
	You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. 
</p>
<p>
The Site has reasonable safeguards to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our 
control.  Notwithstanding these efforts, we can make no assurances that the information you submit will be secure, 
and that unauthorized third parties will not be successful in breaching our security measures and accessing your 
information.  If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that 
you can take appropriate protective steps.  By using the Site or providing personal information to us, you agree 
that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to 
your use of the Site.  If a security breach occurs, we may post a notice on the Site or send an email to you at any 
email address you may have provided to us.
</p>

<div><b>International Users</b></div>
<p>
	The Site is hosted in the United States.  If you access the Site from any other region with laws or regulations
  governing personal data collection, use and disclosure, that differ from the laws of the United States, please note 
  that you are transferring your data to the United States which may not have the same data protection laws as other 
  regions, and by providing your personal data you consent to:
  </p><ol>
  	<li>
  	  the use of your personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy Policy; and	
  	</li>
    <li>
      the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.  
    </li>
  </ol>
<p></p>
<p>
  Your information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries where laws 
	regarding processing of information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
</p>

<div><b>Change of Control</b></div>
<p>
	In the event of a change of control of Catchafire from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or upon 
	Catchafire’s filing for a bankruptcy, information Catchafire receives from you is a Catchafire asset and may be transferred.
