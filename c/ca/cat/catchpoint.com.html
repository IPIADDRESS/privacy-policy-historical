In addition, the Catchpoint Service known as “Real User Measurement” (the “RUM Service”) is used by Catchpoint’s customers to measure a consumer’s actual experience of a Web Property. The RUM Service measures how fast a web page and its components load on a consumer’s browser to provide web developers with information to improve speed and reliability, and to detect and fix errors. With the exception of the RUM Service, the Catchpoint Services do not measure or collect information about actual consumer visits or actual consumers.<br><br>In connection with providing the RUM Service to a customer, Catchpoint collects the following information about a consumer from a customer’s Web Property:<br><br>• Browser Information; and<br>• Information about a consumer’s usage of the Web Property that our customer asks Catchpoint to collect, which can include, for example, factors such as the number of visits, the number of page views per visit, whether the visit results in a purchase or other transaction, and whether the Web Property produced any errors during the visit.<br><br><span class="avenir-5-font">How the RUM Service collects information about consumers<br></span>Catchpoint Services use cookies and similar technologies, such as embedded scripts and web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to collect the information described above.
