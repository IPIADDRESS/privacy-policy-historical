under the 1998 Data Protection Act.</p>
<p>Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality 
of your CV and Profile, and other information you may give us while using the 
site. You can amend or delete any of the information that CatererGlobal.com 
stores about you by logging in to ‘My Account’ or by contacting us at
<a href="mailto:webadmin@catererglobal.com">webadmin@catererglobal.com</a> with 
your request.</p>
<p>CatererGlobal.com is hosted by a third party - Madgex Ltd.</p>
<p><b>Profile and CV information</b><br>
Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are 
stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested.</p>
<p>When you complete your CatererGlobal.com profile, it may be made available 
for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by CatererGlobal.com’s 
customers. Customers that request details of candidates with your type of 
profile, may be sent your profile by email.</p>
<p>These may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other 
organisations.</p>
<p>Your CV can be uploaded as part of an online application. Therefore this will 
be sent to the employer that you choose to send it to. The CV will be kept 
electronically by us, and may be viewed by employers.</p>
<p>When registering your profile, you can choose to prevent our customers from 
accessing your personal details and profile.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Your current employer may be a customer of CatererGlobal.com, or a 
client of one of our consultancy customers. CatererGlobal.com cannot restrict 
the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible 
for any eventuality. As part of the registration process CatererGlobal.com 
offers you the option of remaining anonymous.</p>
<p>CatererGlobal.com will also use the aggregate data to identify trends, such 
as salary averages and experience/skills levels. This information will not be 
capable of being linked to any personally identifying information about users.</p>
<p>If you choose to create a profile and upload a CV to our database, we rely on 
you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your CV 
at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. 
Once your profile and CV are on our database we will contact you every six 
months using your most recent contact details to ask whether you want it to 
remain there. If we do not hear from you, your profile and CV will be removed 
from our database.</p>
<p>Please note that CatererGlobal.com reserves the right to remove from our 
database CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or 
offensive. We will also remove a CV if a complaint is upheld, which has been 
made against it.</p>
