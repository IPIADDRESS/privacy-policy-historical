<p><b>The Information We Collect</b> 
<br> CatholicMatch.com is an online singles service designed to provide an easy way for our members to meet each other on the Web. To accomplish this, our members create their own unique profiles which are viewable by other members. In order to do this, we must ask for certain personal information. None of the information we gather can be used by the public (visitors, other members, or anyone not employed by Acolyte, LLC or the financial institutions used to process membership charges) to identify specific individuals.</p>
<p>We are a membership-based service. We collect credit card, address, or bank information only from those who choose to join. Paid members are permitted access to all functionality offered on the site, while members who join for free maybe only browse the site but not contact any other members. All visitors to our site may browse the site and view some articles or features our site has to offer without entering any personal information.</p>
<p><b>Information Collected/Tracked by CatholicMatch.com</b> <br> CatholicMatch.com gathers two types of information: information users submit to us and information not directly submitted by users. 
</p><p><b>Information submitted to CatholicMatch.com</b> <br>There are two types of user-submitted information we collect: Public and Private. We define Public information as personal information that may be displayed on the site, such as gender, age and height, but cannot be linked to a particular user. Private information is defined as any information that allows others to contact a user other than through CatholicMatch.com or allows the collection of information about the user other than what is displayed on the site. 
</p><p><b>Public:</b> To accomplish our goal of bringing Catholic people together, we must gather personal information, which may or may not include: customer-specified CatholicMatch.com username, gender, age, birth date, first name, ethnic background, appearance, religion, occupation, information and general geographic location. Some of this information is optional, and meant to be seen by members and visitors to the site but cannot be used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc. 
</p><p><b>Private:</b> This information is gathered from members and guests who apply for the various services our site offers. This information includes, but is not limited to: email address, last name, credit card number for payment, a user-specified password, mailing address, zip code and telephone number. 
</p><p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests:</b> From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, and age).

</p><p><b>Private:</b> We primarily use Email addresses submitted by members to verify enrollment. Respondees' email addresses are not disclosed to the responder. We may also use a user's email address to send news regarding our site. Email addresses may also be used in private correspondence with the user for customer service issues. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. All other private information submitted by the user is confidential and will not be disclosed except as required by law or to protect members of CatholicMatch.com. All private information can be updated at any time. Surveys &amp; Contests: Contact and other information collected for contests will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information collected will be used for purposes of marketing, monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. CatholicMatch.com Partners: Information submitted by the Partner is used for establishing and maintaining a business relationship. No personal or business information is shared outside the relationship between CatholicMatch.com and the Partner. Partners may not view or access private information on CatholicMatch.com subscribers.

</p><p><b>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</b> <br>Except where you are expressly informed otherwise or as described immediately below, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information except to the financial institution that processes your credit card unless required by law or for the protection of your membership. If you register with CatholicMatch.com through one of our co-branded versions, your registration and profile information may be shared with the co-branding partner solely for the purpose of fulfilling the services provided by the co-branded site and any related promotional offers.
