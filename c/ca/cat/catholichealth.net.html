Depending on your Mobile Provider and mobile device, we may automatically receive this information. If we begin to offer services that use this tracking (“pinpointing”) information, we will obtain your consent (an opt-in) before using the information. After obtaining such consent, we may use and store this information to provide location-based services, including location-targeted advertising.&nbsp; Most mobile device provide users with the ability to disable location services. These controls are usually located in the mobile device 's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your mobile device’s location services, we recommend you contact your Mobile Provider or your mobile device manufacturer.</p>
<p><b>HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Non-Personal Information</b></p>
<p><b><u>&nbsp;</u></b></p>
<p>We may use and share non-personal information – that is, de-identified information that cannot be used to identify you - for any lawful business purpose without any obligation or accounting to you.&nbsp; For example, we can use non-personal information for developing products, services, and providing those offerings to other users and third parties. We may use your personal information to generate non-personal information. When we do so, we will take reasonable measures to ensure that the non-personal information is no longer personally identifiable and cannot later be used to identify you.&nbsp; We may also disclose non-personal, aggregate, anonymous data in a de-identified format based on information collected from users to investors, and other third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
<p><b><u>&nbsp;</u></b></p>
<p>We may use and disclose your information collected through our Sites (1) to perform the services described on the Sites, (2) to your health care provider, (3) as permitted by law, and (4) to contact you regarding our services. We may combine and enhance your information with information we receive from third parties, as long as we use the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also use all information collected through our Sites for research regarding the effectiveness of our Sites and our business planning, marketing, advertising, and sales efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide services to you, for example those who assist us with technical or customer support, and email and data analytics.&nbsp; Unless we tell you differently, they do not have any right to use your information beyond what is necessary to assist us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may buy, merge, or partner with other companies or businesses and in so doing, acquire or transfer information. Information collected through the websites may be among the transferred business assets. In the event that a portion or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, your information would likely be a transferred business asset, and you hereby agree to such a transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information at the request of law enforcement or government agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, to establish, protect or exercise our legal or other rights or to defend against a legal claim or as otherwise required or allowed by law.&nbsp; We may disclose your information in order to protect the rights, property, or safety of a user or any other person.&nbsp; We may disclose your information to investigate or prevent a violation by you of any contractual or other relationship with us, or your illegal or harmful activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>It is your responsibility to protect account login information, such as your username and password, from unauthorized access. You must not share your login information with any third party.&nbsp; Write down your mobile app ID and password and keep it in a safe place.&nbsp; If you share your login information with anyone, that person will be able to access your personal information and send messages as if that person were you. <b>We recommend you log out after accessing your account, change your password on a periodic basis, and limit access to your computer or mobile device and their browsers.</b> While we use commercially reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing our files or tampering with the Sites, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful. <b>We do not represent, warrant, or guarantee that our safeguards will protect the total privacy of your information disclosed on the Sites. Your Information may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to or from us. Do not use the Sites from computers in public libraries or Internet cafes because your personal information may not be protected.</b>&nbsp; <b>We cannot and do not ensure, represent, warrant, or guarantee the security of any information you transmit through the Sites.</b></p>
<p><b>Retention of YOUR Information; Modification</b></p>
<p><b>Correcting, Updating, Accessing, or Removing Personal Information</b></p>
<p>If your information changes, or<b> if you no longer want to receive information from CHI beyond information related to our services, you can correct, update, or remove your previously-provided personal information.&nbsp; This can be done by emailing a request to us at</b> <a href="mailto:social@catholichealth.net">social@catholichealth.net</a><span>. </span>&nbsp;You may also request access to personal information collected by us by sending a request to us at <a href="mailto:social@catholichealth.net">social@catholichealth.net</a>.&nbsp; In certain circumstances, we may not be able to completely remove your information from our systems.&nbsp; For example, we may retain your personal information for legitimate business purposes, our customer requirements, or your health care provider’s requirements, or if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for account recovery purposes, if required by law, or as retained in our data backup systems or cached or archived pages.&nbsp; All of the personal information of yours that we keep will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which you have previously agreed.</p>
<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>
<p>California law permits users that are residents of California to request the following information regarding our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes:&nbsp; (i) a list of certain categories of personal information that we have disclosed to certain third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, (ii) the identity of certain third parties that received personal information from us for their direct marketing purposes during that calendar year, and (iii) examples of the products or services marketed (if we have that information).&nbsp; If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please email us at <a href="mailto:social@catholichealth.net">social@catholichealth.net</a>.</p>
<p><b>Third-Party Privacy Policies</b></p>
<p>The Sites may include or provide links to other websites o- mobile apps on the Internet that we do not control. Even if an affiliation exists between CHI and a third party website or mobile app – and even if they are linked to or from one of our Sites - each of these linked Sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. While we expect our affiliates and vendors to respect the privacy of our users, we cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties. <b>IF YOU VISIT A WEBSITE OR MOBILE APP VIA A LINK ON THE SITES, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSULT THAT WEBSITE'S OR MOBILE APP’S PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE PROVIDING YOUR INFORMATION AND WHENEVER INTERACTING WITH ANY WEBSITES OR MOBILE APPS.</b></p>

If you are using the Sites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Sites, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
