<p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically and from Other Sources</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>Whenever you interact with our Sites (whether via a browser, an application, or otherwise), we automatically receive and record information from your browser.&nbsp; Other information collected automatically may include your IP address, the type of browser or application you are using to access our Sites, and the identity of the Sites page or feature you are requesting. We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our Sites, and gather broad demographic data for aggregate use. We may also collect information regarding the mobile devices you use to access or use our Sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To collect this information, we may use “cookies” or other tracking technologies to track how you use our Sites. We also may send instructions to your computer or device using JavaScript® or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Sites.&nbsp; A cookie is a piece of software stored on your computer or device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your computer or device.&nbsp; If applicable, our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser, application, or mobile device, when you click on ads that appear on the Sites. Also, if you click on a link to a third-party website or service, that third party may also transmit cookies to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use “web beacons”, also known as “single–pixel” or “clear” GIFs.&nbsp; Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their Sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You may adjust your web browser software if you do not wish to receive cookies or web beacons, </strong><strong>but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Sites’ features.</strong>&nbsp; Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or web beacons by any third parties, so be sure to review the privacy policy of any third-party websites you visit.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also request to opt out of advertisers’ use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a><span><em>. </em></span>You may request to opt-out of Google’s® use of cookies by visiting: <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences">www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information from Your Mobile Device</strong></p>
<p>We may also use technologies, such as location-based information, to provide you with tailored information and features as you use our Sites.&nbsp; When you access the Sites on your mobile device we may obtain information from your mobile device about the type of mobile device you are using. We may use this information to notify you of features and products that may be available on your mobile device. Certain features may require our collection of the phone number of your mobile device. We may link that phone number to the mobile device identification information, but will not use that number for telemarketing. In addition, some mobile network providers (<strong>Mobile Provider</strong>) in the U.S. are required to use technology that tracks the physical location of mobile device that use their service. Depending on your Mobile Provider and mobile device, we may automatically receive this information. If we begin to offer services that use this tracking (“pinpointing”) information, we will obtain your consent (an opt-in) before using the information. After obtaining such consent, we may use and store this information to provide location-based services, including location-targeted advertising.&nbsp; Most mobile device provide users with the ability to disable location services. These controls are usually located in the mobile device 's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your mobile device’s location services, we recommend you contact your Mobile Provider or your mobile device manufacturer.</p>

We may use your personal information to generate non-personal information. When we do so, we will take reasonable measures to ensure that the non-personal information is no longer personally identifiable and cannot later be used to identify you.&nbsp; We may also disclose non-personal, aggregate, anonymous data in a de-identified format based on information collected from users to investors, and other third parties.&nbsp;</p>
