<p><b><i>What personally identifiable information is being collected and used?</i></b></p>
<p>In general, you can visit the Cabela’s Canada website without telling us who you are or providing us with any personally identifiable information. However, in order for us to provide you with the products, services or other information that you have requested, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, when you order a product, we may ask you to become a registered user of our website, during which you will be asked for your name, shipping and billing addresses, your e-mail address, and your telephone number. Similarly, when you purchase products through our&nbsp;catalogue, we collect the name, address, e-mail address and telephone number of the purchaser. We may also collect the name, address and telephone number of the person to whom the items are to be shipped (if different than the purchaser). Third-party shipping information shall only be used for the purpose of processing and fulfilling the order. The information we collect is used to process your order and provide you with the products and services you have requested. You do not have to provide us with any personally identifiable information when you purchase products at our retail store by cash.</p>
<p>If you use a credit or debit card to purchase a product online, in-store, or through our&nbsp;catalogue, your payment card related information and your signature will be collected for the purposes of processing your payment. If you pay for a purchase by money order, cheque or C.O.D, the name, address, e-mail address and telephone number of the purchaser will be collected in order to identify you and contact you regarding your payment, if necessary.</p>
<p>If you request to receive our catalogues, e-mails, newsletters, or other marketing materials we may collect your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. If you wish to stop receiving any of these materials, you may contact us at&nbsp;<b>1.800.265.6245</b>, send us an e-mail at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacyofficer@cabelas.ca"><b>privacyofficer@cabelas.ca</b></a>, or write us at the postal address provided above. &nbsp;E-mail recipients can also opt-out from receiving future emails by using the opt-out link in each e-mail.</p>
<p>If you request, we may make your postal mailing address information available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are part of the Cabela's family of companies, or to other direct mail companies who we believe may have products and services of interest to our customers, for the marketing purposes of those companies. If you wish to stop receiving any of these materials, you may contact us at&nbsp;<b>1.800.265.6245</b>, send us an e-mail at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacyofficer@cabelas.ca"><b>privacyofficer@cabelas.ca</b></a>, or write us at the postal address provided above.</p>
<p>If you contact our customer service representatives by telephone or e-mail we may collect your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. We may store a record of your request/inquiry along with your name, address and other personal contact information you provide to assist you in the future and to improve our products and services.</p>

<p>When purchasing on our website or through our catalogues we may request your telephone number or facsimile (FAX) number; and, if you provide it, you may receive telephone or FAX contact from us with information regarding your orders.</p>
<p>We may post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
<p>When you order a gift card we collect information regarding the amount of the gift card and information you may provide about the recipient such as the name, address and telephone number of the party receiving the gift card as well as any message you provide on a gift card. This information is only used for the purpose of processing and fulfilling your gift card order.</p>
<p>When you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, we may collect your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information that you provide. We use this information to administer your participation in the contest or promotion. At the time you enter the contest or promotion, we may obtain your consent to send you future promotional communications from Cabela’s Canada or its marketing partners.

We do not control the use, disclosure or security of your personal information by other sponsors, and recommend you review their respective privacy notices or statements.</p>
<p>We may collect optional information such as your postal code or phone number and responses to questions about your purchasing preferences. We may use this information to help us carry the right assortment of products for your needs and to tailor the promotional material you receive.</p>
<p>The "Forward To A Friend" (or other similar implementation) function commonly associated with e-mail messages will allow us to send an email to another recipient on your behalf. This requires that you submit your name and email address, as well as the name and email address of the recipient. The recipient will receive a single introductory email but must then opt-in to confirm their willingness to receive future emails. &nbsp;We do not use the names or email addresses submitted in these circumstances for any other purpose without the consent of you or the email recipient.</p>
<p>In addition, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as your computer's IP address, page requests, browser type, operating system, referring page, and average time spent on the website, however that information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you. We use this information to monitor and improve our website.</p>
<p>In connection with a job application or related inquiry, we collect certain personal information you provide about yourself, such as that contained in a resume or similar employment-related materials. We use this information to process and respond to your application or inquiry.</p>
<p><b><i>With whom does Cabela’s Canada share your information?</i></b></p>
<p>Except as otherwise set out in the Privacy Statement, we will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information without your consent.</p>

We may transmit your personal information to service providers who assist us in processing orders, shipping products to you, processing your payment information, sending you catalogues, conducting surveys, on and offline sweepstakes, processing job applications, and sending you e-mails and newsletters. Your personal information may be stored and processed within Canada and the United States by our affiliates and other third party service providers. Our service providers are required to implement measures to safeguard your personal information, use it only in compliance with applicable privacy laws, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than providing the services on our behalf or as otherwise legally required.</p>
<p>We may transfer any information we have about you as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including transfers made part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Cabela’s Canada or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control.</p>
<p><b><i>How to access, update, or correct my personally identifiable information?</i></b></p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our website, you can manage many aspects of your registration information online. For security reasons, however, some parts of your personal information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before such changes can be made. The online registration area will also permit you to exercise control over the use of your e-mail address, allowing you to opt-out of future e-mail messages from Cabela’s Canada. If you prefer to manage your personal information via other means, or if you would like to access, update, or correct any of your personal information we have in our possession, you may contact us at&nbsp;<b>1.800.265.6245</b>, send us an e-mail at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacyofficer@cabelas.ca"><b>privacyofficer@cabelas.ca</b></a>, or write us at the postal address provided above.</p>

<p><b><i>What are cookies and how does Cabela’s Canada use them?</i></b></p>
<p>A cookie is a block of text placed in a file on the user's hard drive by a website you've visited. These types of cookies cannot identify an individual user specifically, such as by name or address, unless the cookie data is attached to personally identifiable information such as online registration. Cabela's Canada uses cookies to observe our site visitor's navigation throughout the site. This helps us identify ways to improve the shopping experience.</p>
<p>Cabela's Canada also uses a session cookie, which is a piece of identification between your browser and our server, which helps to do things like keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart, and other information. The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case the users' session expires or they return to complete a purchase within that time frame. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from the Cabela’s Canada website, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our website.</p>
