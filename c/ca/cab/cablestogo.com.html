                            C2G is the sole owner of the information collected on this website. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. The information that customers share enables us to provide a more valuable shopping experience through personalization and performance monitoring.

                                <b>Registration Page:</b> In order to place an order on this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (including name, email address, phone and fax number). This information is used to contact users about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. There are also unique identifiers (such as customer number) that are not required, but requested so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. Site registration is also required for "reseller access" which features information pertinent to resellers and requires the mailing, emailing, or faxing of a valid reseller certificate; and it is also required for "tax exempt business access" which features information relevant to our tax-exempt customers and requires the mailing, emailing, or faxing of a valid tax exemption certificate. Acceptance of reseller registration or tax exemption is not guaranteed, and is up to the discretion of C2G and its agents.

                        <p>
                            Information we collect online may be used to provide you access to certain parts of the website, to enable you to purchase products from our site, to allow us to fulfill any orders or supply any information you have requested, to collect payment from you as appropriate, to contact you regarding any financial transactions or information requests, to customize your personal online shopping experience, to analyze our performance so we can improve our service level, and to produce aggregate data (that does not include personally identifiable information) for analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We partner with third-party service providers who perform work on our behalf, and share personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide contracted services. These providers may only use the data we provide them to do what is required to assist us. Our third-party service providers include: outside shipping companies (UPSâ¢ and FedExÂ®) to deliver orders, a credit/debit card processing company (Chaseâ¢ Paymentech) to bill users for goods and services, an email delivery provider to send promotional and transactional emails (GlobalIntellisystems), various web analytic tools, and various printing, mailing, and/or marketing service providers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These companies are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services, and do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We will not knowingly sell or rent your personal information to anyone without your express permission with the exception that we reserve the right to disclose your personal information when, in our judgment, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to prevent injury, harm or fraud to individuals or property; to report activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful; to protect our rights or the rights of others; or to comply as required by law.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with data from third-party sources. For example, to determine if a customer qualifies for one of our credit cards, we may use the customer's name and social security number to request a credit report. Once we determine a customer's creditworthiness, this document is destroyed.

                            How We Protect Your Security
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and offline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our site has obtained a digital certificate, and has been identified as a "Secure Site" by VerisignÂ®, a leader in computer network security. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as your credit/debit card number), we encrypt that data and protect the transmission of that information by using the most advanced form of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software: 128-bit encryption by VeriSign.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can confirm the security of your data when you enter the secure part of a website (any part of a website which can display any personal information). For older browsers such as Internet Explorer version 6, you should see the lock icon at the bottom of the browser become locked (vs. unlocked or open when you are visiting a non-secure page). For newer browsers the URL address bar or the bottom right corner should show a golden lock, and the URL address should be highlighted in green. If the URL address is highlighted in red and/or shows a certificate error message in the address bar or in a popup window, the security for that page may be compromised. To learn more about SSL, visit <a href="http://www.verisign.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.verisign.com</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For further security, we're proud to display McAfeeÂ® Hacker SafeÂ® certification which authenticates a daily test to ensure CablesToGo.com passes their rigorous security scan. This is the most comprehensive web security certification service available, and research confirms that sites remotely scanned in this manner, can prevent over 99% of hacker crime. Finally, we also belong to BBBOnlineÂ®, part of the Better Business BureauÂ®, and will work to quickly resolve any customer complaints in accordance with BBBÂ® procedures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We do not transmit your credit card number when confirming your order. Only the last four digits of your credit card number are revealed on the web order confirmation page. In order to charge your credit/debit card, we securely send the complete credit card number to a third-party credit processing company while following internet best practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All user information, not just the sensitive data mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. We operate in a secured, locked facility that requires all employees to scan in and wear valid ID badges. We limit access to personal information so that it is only used by authorized individuals for the appropriate reasons. Security cameras plus an alarm system throughout the building restrict access to the public. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screensavers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must reenter their password to regain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, all CablesToGo.com web and database servers which store personal information are located and maintained in a secure, locked location; only employees with appropriate security clearance can access this restricted area. Database access is closely monitored and protected from the outside. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@c2g.com">webmaster@c2g.com</a>.
