<p><b xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">ThisIsCable.com Protects the Privacy of Your Personally
Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>ThisIsCable understands the importance of safeguarding your
personally identifiable information. We use the personally
identifiable information you provide to us for a very narrow and
specific purpose: to help you learn what broadband cable services
are available in your neighborhood and which cable company provides
them, and to help you sign up for the services you choose.</p>
<p>When you first ask ThisIsCable for information about broadband
cable services in your area, we need to know your physical address.
We use your address to determine which cable company or companies
provide services to your neighborhood. Cable companies use
ThisIsCable to give you specific information about cable service
offers that are available at your address. Should you choose to
place an order for broadband cable services, you will then need to
supply ThisIsCable with additional personally identifiable
information.</p>
<p>Our policy regarding this information is simple. ThisIsCable
will not sell or rent any of the personally identifiable
information you provide. In fact, the personally identifiable
information you supply will not be disclosed to any third party
EXCEPT to the cable company that offers in your neighborhood the
services you are interested in. And, unless you decide otherwise,
the cable company can only use your information as necessary to
furnish to you the services you have selected through
ThisIsCable.</p>
<p>We do collect aggregate statistical data, without names or
specific street addresses, on the use of ThisIsCable. We do this in
order to monitor customer traffic patterns and service use. This
helps us administer the ThisIsCable service and improve its design
and performance. We also keep a log of your query and response for
approximately one month for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
