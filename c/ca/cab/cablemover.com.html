        <p>Effective January 2006</p> 

        <p><b>MoverHotline.com is committed to protecting your privacy.</b></p>

        <p>This
Privacy Policy will provide information to you regarding how we collect
and use your personal information, and about choices you have
concerning our use of such information. Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully. From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to
address new issues or changes to our practices. These changes will be
posted here so that you will always know our privacy policies. Please
check this Privacy Policy periodically to see if there have been any
revisions.</p>

        <p>MoverHotline.com is a Web site independently
operated by Broadbandoffers.com under agreement with our partner
providers. Some offers brought to you by MoverHotline.com are not
available directly from our partner providers.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:moverhotlineprivacy@customerservicesite.com">moverhotlineprivacy@customerservicesite.com</a> or mail us at the following address:</p>

        <blockquote>
        	<p><b>MoverHotline.com</b><br>
        	 1555 Sherman Avenue<br>

        <p><b>Scope of Privacy Policy<br>
        </b>This
Privacy Policy applies to MoverHotline.com's method of collection and
use of information gathered by us for the customers that we serve on
http://www.moverhotline.com (the "Web Site"). However, please note that
the privacy practices of our partner providers are not covered by this
Privacy Policy. In addition, once you leave our Web Site via a link or
otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply and MoverHotline.com
cannot and is not responsible for how data and information obtained
from you on other Web sites is used by the operators of such Web sites.</p>

        <p><b>Security<br>
        </b>We
believe that protecting the security of your Personal Information is
very important. Therefore, we have put strong security measures in
place to attempt to protect your Personal Information. Access to
Personal Information is limited to MoverHotline.com employees or other
authorized individuals, and a limited number of our fulfillment
partners. Identities are verified by internal network access rules and
application username/password pairs. Data fields that identify
individuals are separated from non-sensitive data fields. Data
identifying Personal Information is encrypted through use of industry
standard AES encryption methods and practices. Data decryption keys are
kept physically separate from encryption keys and encrypted data.
Records are marked with tamper-proof authentication digests.</p>

        <p>MoverHotline.com
requires internal users to use MoverHotline.com's standardized methods
of data transfer, encryption and storage. We encourage external
parties, service providers and vendors to use our standardized methods
of data transfer, encryption and storage, or an equivalent method.</p>

        <p>We
also monitor hardware and software logs for operational compliance with
security policies. MoverHotline.com quarantines data that arrives on a
channel not approved in the policy until its source and disposition can
be determined in accordance with the security policy. Consequences of
non-compliance range from delay in reporting response times to refusal
to accept or verify data, in accordance with penalties specified by
contract. </p>

        <p>Barriers erected to prevent potential
breaches of secure information include a sophisticated security system,
internal audits, internal policies/procedures and a daily backup of all
information. The Director of Technology is responsible for all aspects
of secure information within MoverHotline.com.</p>

        <p>No
service provider/vendor/external party should be able to decrypt the
encrypted data of any other service provider/vendor/external party
should data be misdelivered.</p>

        <p><b>Enforcement<br>
        </b>MoverHotline.com
monitors data center metrics on approximately a weekly basis. Network
vulnerability testing and standard NOC monitoring are provided by the
data center administration staff, with options for performing
third-party security audits on demand. MoverHotline.com performs full
recovery tests prior to live deployment of a new application or server
system. MoverHotline.com performs recovery tests of backup media on a
monthly to quarterly schedule to assure that existing backup regimes
have created working recovery sets.</p>

        <p>MoverHotline.com actively monitors current and upcoming regulatory and compliance issues through outside legal resources.</p>
