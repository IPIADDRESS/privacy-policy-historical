					<p class="bold ptop20">Links to other websites</p>
					Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

					<ul class="disc">
						<li>whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes</li>

					We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen. <br><br>
					Cabanova GmbH will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties, unless the member has not adhered to our terms and conditions (e.g. created a phishing site) or is required by law to do so. In such cases of abuse of the Cabanova services, each individual case will be reviewed and personal information may be passed on to the relevant company or person who is the victim of the abuse. <br><br>
					You may request details of personal information which we hold about you. A small fee will be payable. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to the address listed at the bottom of this page.
					
					<p class="bold ptop20">Newsletters</p>
					 Cabanova GmbH uses email as the method of contact with its customers. When signing up to become a member of Cabanova, the user must agree to accept and cannot unsubscribe from non-promotional emails (e.g. emails containing invoices, support correspondence and subscription information). In order to stop receiving non-promotional emails from Cabanova GmbH is by cancelling relevant subscription to our services. <br><br>
					 Cabanova GmbH also sends promotional emails (e.g. special offers) periodically. <br><br>
					 Additional information collected for each sent newsletter is:<br>
					- number of newsletter opens<br>
					- number of clicks on each link inside a newsletter<br><br>
					
					<p class="bold ptop20">Subscribe / Unsubscribe methodology for Cabanova promotional newsletters</p>
					Each newsletter subscription needs to be confirmed. The confirmation (double opt in) is done by sending an initial greeting email, where a user action is needed to confirm the subscription, by clicking the unique personalized confirmation link. This way we ensure that the user agrees upon joining the newsletter list, and that the email addresses are real. <br><br>
					Each newsletter received has clear information about the sender and unsubscribe methods. The unsubscribe is fulfilled within seconds after clicking the unsubscribe link and no further communication will be sent to the users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information, unless they choose to register to the newsletter again. 
					
					<p class="bold ptop20">Policy Modifications</p>
					We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when Cabanova makes changes to this privacy statement, we will highlight the changes on our homepage and email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
