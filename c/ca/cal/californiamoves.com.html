			<p><span class="blackcopy"><br>We at <b>Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</b>
(referred to as <b>"Coldwell Banker," "We," "Us," or "Our"</b>) recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of
certain information collected about the <b>users and visitors</b> of Our Web
Site (referred to as <b>"User," "You" or "Your"</b>).
This Privacy Policy discloses what information We gather, how We use it, and
how to correct or change it. At Coldwell Banker, it is Our intention to give
You an understanding about how We collect Your information and the use We make
of it in the course of Our business. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">To that end, Coldwell Banker gathers two types of
information about You: 1) data that Users provide through optional, voluntary
registration on Our Web Site, and 2) data that Coldwell Banker gathers through
aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying Web pages that are viewed by Users
throughout Our Web Site. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">However, be assured that Coldwell Banker will not
disclose Personal Information (as defined herein) to third parties without Your
consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to You when
the information is submitted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy"><a href="CaliforniaPrivacyPolicyRights.aspx">Privacy Notice to 
						California Customers</a></span></p>
			<p><b><u><span class="formlabelblkleft">How Does Coldwell Banker Collect Information?</span></u></b><span class="blackcopy">
					<o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
			<p><u><span class="blackcopy">Optional Registration</span></u><span class="blackcopy"> We collect information by specifically requesting it
from You. Generally this occurs when You register at the Web Site or request
information or a service. Usually, We and Our business partners use Your
information to operate the Web Site and to deliver services. Coldwell Banker
also uses Your information to inform You about other products and/or services available
from Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy"><u>Use of Tracking</u> Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses:</span>
			</p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">An IP address is a unique number that is
automatically assigned to Your computer whenever You are surfing the Internet
so that Your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as
"Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. This allows Us to
identify and gather general information and data about You, such as the Web
pages You view. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">Coldwell Banker collects IP addresses for the purposes
of: helping Us diagnose problems with Our main computers, for system
administration, to report aggregated information to Our business partners, and
to audit the use of Our Web Site. When Users request Web pages from Our Web
Site, Our Web servers log the User's IP address. We do not normally link IP
addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a User's
session will be logged, but the User will remain anonymous to Us. For example,
We collect and/or track the home server domain name, the type of computer, and
the type of Web browser used by You to access this Web Site. Such collection
and tracking information is gathered by Us as You navigate through this Web
Site, and shall be used by Us for Our business purposes only. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">We can, and will, use IP addresses to identify You
when We feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with Our Web Site Terms of
Use or to protect Our service, site, Users, or others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy"><u>Use Of Cookies</u> What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web
site sends to Your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is
stored in a file on Your computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web surfing easier
for You by saving Your preferences so that We can use the saved information to
facilitate Your use of Our Web Site when You return to the Web Site. Cookies do
not tell Us Your individual identity unless You have chosen to provide it to
Us. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of
cookies is an industry standard, and as such, You will find that most major Web
sites use them. </span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">By showing how and when Users use the Web Site,
cookies help Us see which areas of the Web Site are popular and which are not.
Many improvements and updates to the Web Site are based on such data as total
number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked
with cookies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">Most cookies expire after a defined period of time,
or You can delete Your cookie file at any time. Most Web browsers are initially
set up to accept cookies. You can reset Your Web browser to refuse cookies or
to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of
Coldwell Banker and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' services will not function
properly or may be considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example,
without cookies, You will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or
may have difficulty completing marketing transactions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">Coldwell Banker and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates
have two (2) primary uses for cookies. First, We use them to specify a User's
preferences. Second, We use cookies to track Web site usage trends and
patterns. This helps Us understand Our Users' needs better and improve areas of
Our Web Site. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, You
have the option of disabling (refusing) the cookies via Your Web browser
preferences. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">You may occasionally get cookies from Our business
partners. Coldwell Banker and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates do not control
these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by such third-party Web
servers is standard in the Internet industry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><u><span class="formlabelblkleft">With Whom Does Coldwell Banker Share Information?</span></u></b><span class="blackcopy">
					<o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">As a general rule, Coldwell Banker will not disclose
any specific personal information that You submit to Us about You ("<b>Personal Information</b>") in a manner that connects You with the Personal
Information, except when We have Your permission or under special
circumstances, such as when We believe in good faith that the law requires it
or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the
ways that Your Personal Information may be disclosed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><u><span class="blackcopy">Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</span></u><span class="blackcopy">: Coldwell Banker may disclose some or all of Your
Personal Information to business partners or sponsors, but this use will be
specifically described to You prior to data collection or prior to transferring
the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information
from sponsors. By requesting more information, You give Coldwell Banker
permission to transfer Your Personal Information to the sponsor so they can
fulfill Your request. In many instances, only Your e-mail address will be
shared. If more Personal Information will be shared with the sponsor, You will
be notified prior to the transfer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><u><span class="blackcopy">Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data</span></u><span class="blackcopy">: From time to time, You may be offered the
opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If You
opt to receive information from these third parties, Coldwell Banker will (with
Your permission) share Your name and e-mail address with such third parties.
Under confidentiality agreements, Coldwell Banker may match Personal
Information with third party data. Also, Coldwell Banker may keep track of what
portions of the Web Site Users are visiting and other User statistics, and aggregate
this information to help Us create a better experience for Users of Our Web
Site. This is all done without knowing Your name or other Personal Information
in order to describe Our viewers and services to prospective partners,
advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><u><span class="blackcopy">Other</span></u><span class="blackcopy">:
Coldwell Banker may also disclose account information in special cases when We
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating
Our Terms of Use, or may be causing injury to or interference (either
intentionally or unintentionally) with any of Coldwell Banker's rights or
property, other Users, or anyone else. Coldwell Banker may disclose or access
account information when We believe in good faith that the law requires it and
for administrative and other purposes that We deem necessary to maintain,
service, and improve Our products and services. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span class="formlabelblkleft">How Can You Control The Usage Of Information? </span></b><span class="blackcopy"><o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">In case You change Your mind or some Personal
Information changes (such as Your zip code or e-mail address), We will try to
provide a way to correct, update or remove the Personal Information that You
give us. We also give You the opportunity to control the communications We
direct to You. If a User wishes to update Personal Information or objects to
any usage provided herein for any reason, he/she may e-mail the requested
change to: <a href="mailto:webadmin@camoves.com">webadmin@camoves.com</a> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><u><span class="formlabelblkleft">What Happens When You Link To A Third Party Site?</span></u></b><span class="blackcopy">
					<o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">You should be aware that when You are on Coldwell
Banker's and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' Web site You can hyperlink, or be
directed to, other Web sites that are beyond Our control and/or outside Our
service. For example, if You "click" on a banner advertisement or a
Coldwell Banker search result, the "click" may transfer You off Our
Web Site. These other Web sites may include sites of advertisers, sponsors, and
partners that may use Our and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' logo as part of a
co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to
Users, collect data, or solicit Information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates do not
control such Web sites, and, therefore, are not responsible for their contents
or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place on such Web sites.
Coldwell Banker's and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' inclusion of hyperlinks to
these Web sites do not imply any endorsement of the material on such Web sites
or any association with their operators. Our Privacy Policy does not extend to
anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond
Coldwell Banker's and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' control. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">Please keep in mind that whenever You give out information
on-line (for example, via message boards or forums) that information can be
collected and used by people You do not know. While Coldwell Banker and
Coldwell Banker-affiliates strive to protect Users' information and privacy, We
cannot guarantee the security of any information You disclose on-line, and You
disclose such information at Your own risk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><u><span class="formlabelblkleft">Is Information Secure From Others Using The Coldwell
Banker Web Site?</span></u></b><span class="blackcopy">
					<o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
			<p><span class="blackcopy">The security of all information associated with Our
Users is an important concern to Us. We exercise care in providing secure
transmission of Your information from Your computer to Our servers.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
100% secure. As a result, while We strive to protect Your information, Coldwell
Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates can't ensure or warrant the security of
any information You transmit to Us or from Our on-line products or services,
and You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive Your transmission, Coldwell
Banker uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of Your
information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL). However,
"perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
