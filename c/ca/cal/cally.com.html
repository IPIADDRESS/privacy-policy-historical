<h2>10. PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>
Except for Date Picker purposes Apps and Sites do not transmit, store or collect any of your personal data at all. We don't have any interest in your data - it's yours, after all. Date Picker events will be automatically deleted one month after the last date of the event. If you have a paid Date Picker plan, events won't be deleted (except on your specific request) but will be kept so you can reference them in the future.
</p><p>
Anonymous Statistics<br>
For the purpose of building the best apps, anonymous statistics such as device type and app version are stored and send to our servers. For example, if we find out that none of our users are still using an iPhone 3GS, we can stop testing on this device, allowing us to focus on newer stuff, instead of supporting legacy. If you dont want us to gather this information either, you can simply disable it in Settings by switching off the 'Anonymously collect usage statistics' switch.
</p><p>
Travel Time<br>
In order to calculate Travel Time which is based on current time and traffic, locations are send to our servers. We do not store these locations. If you disable Travel Time no locations wont be send.
</p><p>
Content Subscriptions<br>
When you go to the calendar store inside the apps or when you have one or more calendar subscriptions, for example public holidays, once in a while a connection with our servers is made to check if there is new calendar content available for you. This update request contains:
</p><ul>
    <li>The App version so we can send back the correct calendar version;</li>
<li>Your language preference, so you can actually read the content;</li>
<li>Your Country preference, so we can send back calendars tailored for your country. For example, we have different calendars available for British users (Soccer calendars), than we have for USA users (Football calendars);</li>
<li>Version of data you downloaded earlier, enabling us to send you calendar changes only thus saving bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
None of this information is stored on our servers.
<p></p><p>
Sharing of Events<br>
When uploading an event or using the 'Share with Messages' functionality, the event selected will be send to our servers where it gets stored, enabling you to send a small and unique web link which can be imported as an event into their calendar. The reason for uploading the event is that it is impossible to share events via Messages, Text or SMS in any other way: only text and web links are possible. All links are deleted after a month automatically.
</p><p>
Information used on your device<br>
None of the information below is send to our Servers, it is used on your device only!
</p><p>
Calendar App<br>
Being calendar (related) applications and site, Apps and Site obviously write to your calendars.
</p><p>
Address Book<br>
Your Address Book is accessed for:
</p><ul>
    <li>Presentation of birthdays</li>
    <li>Linking events to contacts (name &amp; address)</li>
    <li>Sending invitations</li>
</ul>
Other Applications<br>
Apps are able to send data to various third party apps and your web browser, all upon your specific request.<p></p>
<h2>11. RIGHT OF ERASURE</h2>
<p>
In accordance with European legislation you can delete your account and the events you own from the system in the account section of Sites. It is however possible that another user invites, or informs, you about an event again in the future. If you don’t want this either we can block your email address.</p>
