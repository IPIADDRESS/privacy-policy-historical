<h3>callercenter.com Enables Consumers To Conduct a Reverse Phone Lookup On Unknown Numbers And Make Public, Online Complaints About Harassing Phone 

Callers</h3>

<br />

<h4>Learn from the personal experiences of other consumers as well as communicate your complaint to potentially thousands of other consumers</h4><br />



<p><b>Bellevue, WA . June 28, 2010 .</b>

callercenter.com today announced 

that due to the high volume of consumer complaints reported on its site 

regarding potential telemarketing fraud and harassing phone calls, it 

has enhanced its reverse phone lookup service with a dynamic heat map 

that helps users identify the area codes that have the most reports 

of potential fraud.<br /><br />

Every consumer experiences unwanted 

calls on their phones.  Some can be attributed to wrong numbers 

but there are a lot of different kinds of unwanted calls that can be 

truly annoying such as telemarketers and prank callers.  callercenter.com 

is a reverse phone lookup site and phone number consumer complaint service 

that makes it easier for consumers to accurately find callers identities, 

widely communicate complaints and read others complaints about harassing 

phone calls and potential telemarketing fraud.  <br /><br />

Until recently, most users could only 

complain to friends or file a complaint with various government organizations, 

such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These organizations don.t 

typically reveal complaint information to the public and rarely with 

any significant detail.  With this information, the consumer may 

be able to find out enough about their unwanted calls without having 

to pursue any additional action simply by using some of the information 

learned from finding callers. identities and reading other people.s 

complaints and comments. <br /><br />

callercenter.com is one of the 

few consumer advocate sites that goes one step further and reports valid 

phone number complaints to organizations that have the ability to investigate 

and take action. callercenter.com gives consumers the collective 

power to not only report potential fraud to each other, but bind together 

to take action to eliminate these phone callers altogether.  <br /><br />

callercenter.com is a leading 

provider of reverse phone number lookup services that enable consumers 

to simply search a number, including cell numbers (where available), 

landline numbers and VoIP to accurately find the owner of that number. 

Now you can be assured that if you don.t recognize a number or if 

you miss a call from a person that doesn.t leave a message, you can 

use this service to find out if the number is from a business associate, 

bill collector, or just a wrong number.  Reverse phone lookup services 

can be easier to use than traditional white pages people searches because 

phone numbers are more easily linked with specific people helping to 

get you to the right person faster.  <br /><br />

It is important as consumers to learn 

how to recognize and report telephone fraud to help stop some scams.<br /><br />

<h3>Organizations to contact:</h3>

<ul type="DISC">

  <li>Contact a consumer advocacy 

  group like the Better Business Bureau, which seeks to resolve complaints 

  on behalf of consumers.</li>

  <li>Look up the Attorney General.s 

  office for the state in which the business is based: <a href="http://www.naag.org" target="_blank">

<u>www.naag.org</u></a><font size="3" face="Calibri">.</li>

  <li>Contact the Federal Trade 

  Commission at <a href="http://ftc.gov/phonefraud" target="_blank">ftc.gov/phonefraud</a>.</li>

</ul>

Of course, if you put your number on 

the National Do Not Call Registry, you can reduce the number of unwanted 

telemarketing calls you get.<br /><br />
