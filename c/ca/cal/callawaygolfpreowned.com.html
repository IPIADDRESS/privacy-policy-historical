<a name="1"><h2>1. <strong>What kinds of information does  Callaway Golf collect?</strong></h2></a>
<p>Callaway Golf websites can collect information about you in a number of  ways. One way we do this is by directly requesting information from you (such as  on a product order form when you make a purchase, during customer service communications,  as part of a sweepstakes or contest entry form, on registration pages, in  response to a survey or on similar web pages where you are able to enter  information into data fields and then send this information back to Callaway  Golf). You may be asked to provide us with your name, address, credit card  number, credit card expiration date, password reminders (such as your mother’s  maiden name or the name of your favorite pet), phone number, fax number, email  address, shipping address and similar information  about you as an individual. We may also ask you questions about your golf game,  your buying preferences or your lifestyle. We refer to all of this information  as your "<strong>Personal Information</strong>."</p>
<p>Another way  we collect information is by automatically recording information about your  visit to our websites. For example, we might collect data regarding your  activity while on our websites or record the web pages that you have chosen to  visit. This is a common practice for many websites on the Internet. The  information collected does not personally identify you, but may be helpful to  us for marketing purposes or improving the services we offer. We refer to this  type of information as "<strong>General  Data</strong>." For example, we automatically log visitors' domain and IP  addresses (a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer on the  Internet). At times, this General Data may be combined with the Personal  Information that you have provided.&nbsp; As described below, we also use  cookies to enable the website to personalize your future visits and to help you  navigate.</p>
<p>From time to  time, you may also be given the opportunity to give us feedback about our  products or services or to post messages for others to read. Sometimes this is  done anonymously. Other times your name or other identifying features may be  attached. This process will always be voluntary and we will explain to you how  the information will be used whenever we ask for it.</p>
<p>Callaway  Golf intends to give you as much control as possible over your Personal  Information. In general, you can visit Callaway Golf on the Internet without  telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.  There are times, however, when we may need your Personal Information in order  to do such things as process an order, respond to your information requests or  to allow you to participate in online promotions.</p>
<p>If you  choose to give Callaway Golf Personal Information via the Internet, it is also  our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us  that you do not wish to have this Personal Information used as a basis for  further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.&nbsp; For more information, you can call us at 800-200-4726  or 512-247-7617.&nbsp; You can also email <a href="mailto:support@callawaygolfpreowned.com">support@callawaygolfpreowned.com</a> for more information or you can write to us by addressing requests to Internet  Customer Service Representative, Callaway Golf Pre-Owned &amp; Outlet, 9013 Tuscany Way,  Building 1, Suite 110,  Austin, Texas   78754.</p>

Your election to opt-in also is  your agreement that we may share your Personal Information with selected  business partners and affiliates. The opt-in process further means that  Callaway Golf and the entities that we share your Personal Information with (as  described below) may contact you directly in accordance with this Privacy  Policy. Whenever we share Personal Information pursuant to this Privacy Policy,  we will inform the party receiving it that the Personal Information may only be  used for a specific, limited purpose in accordance with this Privacy Policy and  as agreed upon in advance by  Callaway Golf.

<a name="5"><h2>5. <strong>What happens when I make an  online purchase at a Callaway Golf website?</strong></h2>
</a>
<p>Callaway  Golf collects and stores Personal Information that you provide to us when you  make an online purchase, conduct certain online transactions or communicate  offline with our customer service department.&nbsp;  When you place an order, open an account or make certain inquiries, you  will be asked to provide various Personal Information that we will collect, use  and store as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  Among other things, this Personal Information will be used to facilitate  your online transactions (including the processing and shipping of your orders),  send you order-related confirmations and provide you with customer service  support.

Currently, Callaway Golf has subsidiaries in the United   States, Canada,  Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia. Callaway Golf Pre-Owned  and Outlet are operated by Callaway Golf Interactive, Inc., a wholly owned  subsidiary of Callaway Golf Company.&nbsp; In  addition to the Callaway Golf® brand of products, Callaway Golf's brands  include, among others, Odyssey®, Top-Flite® and Ben Hogan®. To the extent that  Personal Information is shared among the Callaway Golf Companies, or to the  extent that one of our subsidiaries obtains your Personal Information directly  from you, we will inform them that the Personal Information may only be used in  accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the event that one or more of the  Callaway Golf Companies merges with, acquires or is acquired by another  company, in whole or in part, we may also share information with this other  business entity and/or transfer this information as a company asset. If this  occurs, we will require that this other business entity follow this Privacy  Policy with respect to your Personal Information.&nbsp; (References in this  Privacy Policy to "Callaway Golf," "our," "we" or  "us" mean all of the Callaway Golf Companies. The privacy policies  that apply to our various websites are very similar to this one, although you  might find differences in the language depending on the country of origin of  the particular website.)</p>
<p><strong>Licensees, Licensors and other Business  Partners:</strong>&nbsp; The Callaway Golf Companies may enter into business  dealings, license agreements or other contracts with third parties (we call  these relationships "<strong>Third Party  Agreements</strong>"). In connection with these Third Party Agreements, the  Callaway Golf Companies may license various trademarks and other intellectual  property rights to third parties. At other times, Callaway Golf may receive  permission from a third party to use the third party’s trademarks or  intellectual property rights. In addition, Callaway Golf may enter into  business relationships or contracts with other companies for a variety of goods  and services. To the extent that Personal Information is shared with these  third parties, we will inform them that the Personal Information may only be  used for a specific, limited purpose in accordance with this Privacy Policy and  as agreed upon in advance by Callaway Golf.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Service Providers and Golf Retailers:</strong>&nbsp; In some instances, your Personal Information  will be shared with third parties who perform services and carry out functions  on our behalf and/or in connection with a product order.&nbsp; These include, among others, third party  payment and order processors, our network of fulfillment entities (such as  local retailers and other product distributors), package delivery services,  data management and analysis companies, marketing professionals, fraud  protection services, website  evaluators and the like.&nbsp; These companies  and individuals may be used, among other ways, to fulfill orders, process  credit card payments, provide customer service, deliver packages, send emails  or post mailings, update customer lists and provide marketing services and  support.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing, Advertising and Website Hosting  Companies:</strong>&nbsp; Occasionally, the Callaway Golf Companies utilize the  services of outside agencies, companies or individuals to run marketing  campaigns, respond to information requests, coordinate contests, sweepstakes  and promotions or to host or operate websites and web pages that are connected  with our business. We may also contract with third parties to help us better  understand your web usage preferences or to analyze data that we collect on our  websites and elsewhere. To the extent that Personal Information is shared with  these third parties, we will inform them that the Personal Information may only  be used for a specific, limited purpose in accordance with this Privacy Policy  and as agreed upon in advance by Callaway Golf.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consultants and Corporate Service Providers:</strong>&nbsp; The Callaway  Golf Companies may use third parties to help us operate various aspects of our  business. This might include people or companies that we bring in to help us  understand how to more efficiently operate our business. It also might include  third parties that we may use to outsource or help facilitate one or more  aspects of our business (e.g. order fulfillment, customer service, co-branding  issues, manufacturing, payment processing, etc.). To the extent that Personal  Information is shared with these third parties, we will inform them that the  Personal Information may only be used for a specific, limited purpose in  accordance with this Privacy Policy and as agreed upon in advance by Callaway  Golf. </p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As noted above, in  the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred  to another party, or in case a transaction occurs in which your Personal  Information is one of the business assets transferred, all Personal Information  that has been collected and stored may be one of the business assets that we  transfer.&nbsp; You will be notified of such a  transfer in accordance with Paragraph 16, below.</p>
<p><strong>Law Enforcement, Regulatory Agencies and  Legal Proceedings:</strong> The Callaway Golf Companies may share your information with  government entities, authorized law enforcement personnel, regulatory bodies or  as part of legal proceedings, in response to a valid subpoena or court order or  as required by applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

We are not responsible for the policies and practices of  other companies.

You should carefully review the  privacy policy of any third party to make sure you are comfortable with how  they are going to treat your personal data. For example, some companies may  require you to opt-out of their information exchange programs. In those  instances, Callaway Golf may receive and/or use information gathered by these  outside companies or agencies, and the handling and processing of your data  will be governed by such third parties’ policies and not by this Callaway Golf  policy.</p>
