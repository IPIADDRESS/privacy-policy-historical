<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.
CallHunter and its authorized agents automatically receive and record "traffic data"
on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie
information, and the page you requested.
</p>

<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>

<p>
  Generally, CallHunter does not initiate communication with users. Service
  related announcements will be made through the site itself on its homepage or
  similarly recognizable location.
</p>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p>
  We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release
  is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our
  <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and other policies; or to
  protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our
  users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
  and organizations for fraud and risk protection.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for
  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the
  information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you
  submit while on our site.

<p>
  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies

</p>

<p>
  Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
  enhance the experience on our site.
</p>

<p>
  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
  areas of our site will be limited.

  Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We
  have no access to or control over these cookies.

  If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware
  that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,
  collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send

  identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

  This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled
  by CallHunter. Please be aware that we, CallHunter, are not responsible for

  statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable

  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that
  you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
  circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
