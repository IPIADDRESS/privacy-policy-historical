            CallTrackingMetrics is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to CallTrackingMetrics or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or log in credentials) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@calltrackingmetrics.com">info@CallTrackingMetrics.com</a>.</p>
          <p>We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
          
          <p><strong>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Compromise of Personal Information</span></strong><br>
            In the event that personal information is compromised as a breach of security, CallTrackingMetrics will promptly notify our customers in compliance with applicable law.</p>
          
          <p><strong>8. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Your Choices About Your Information</span></strong><br>

          <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
          
          <p><strong>9. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Children's Privacy</span></strong><br>
            Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, CallTrackingMetrics does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@calltrackingmetrics.com">info@CallTrackingMetrics.com</a>.</p>
          
          <p><strong>10. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Notification Procedures</span></strong><br>
            It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by CallTrackingMetrics in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p><strong>12. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</span></strong><br>
            If we change our privacy policies and procedures materially, we will post those changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
