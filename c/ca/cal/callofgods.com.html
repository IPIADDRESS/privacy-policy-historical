<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the web sites published  and maintained by Joy Sky, Inc. (“Joy Sky,” “we,” “us,” or “our,”)  including other affiliate sites (collectively, the  “Web Site”). By visiting this Web Site, and/or using the services  offered on or through this Web Site, you agree to the terms of this  Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update  and expand our Web Site, this Privacy Policy may change. Joy Sky  encourages you to review this page from time to time. This Privacy  Policy is incorporated into, and made part of, the Joy Sky Web Site  Terms of Use, which governs your use of this Web Site in general.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It is Joy Sky’s policy to respect and protect the privacy of  visitors to this Web Site. Accordingly, Joy Sky does not extract,  without permission, Personal Information (as defined below) about its  visitors or their computer at any time while on Joy Sky’s Web Site,  except for Personal Information that is actively provided by such  visitors through registration, logging in and out, online forms or other  means. Joy Sky will, however, analyze information about our visitors as  a group to make our Web Site better, but visitors are not individually  identified when we do this.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may  provide to us, or that we may obtain, through sources other than our Web  Site, such as by phone, mail and other live and print mediums.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of  your Personal Information. See the Right to Opt Out section below for  further details.</p>
<p>Joy Sky may collect a variety of statistical data about its Web  Site visitors. This data includes the source IP address (as further  described below in the “IP Address and Clickstream Data” section) of the  visitor, the time of visit, the areas of the site visited and  information about browser, operating system and other system parameters.  As of the date of this Privacy Policy, none of this information is used  to personally identify any individual visitor, and is used solely for  the purposes of analyzing overall traffic and usage patterns. However, Joy Sky reserves the right to begin matching such usage data with an  individual’s Personal Information subsequent to the date of this Privacy  Policy.</p>
<p>In order to make your visits to our Web Site and use of the  services available on or through our Web Site as worthwhile as possible, Joy Sky may also collect Personal Information about its visitors, but  only when a visitor provides such Personal Information to us in the  process of entering contests or sweepstakes, signing up for our  newsletter(s), using our “Feedback” feature, registering with the Web  Site or using other services available on or through our Web Site. The  information that you give us and information about your order, purchases  or other activities on the Web Site may be combined with other Personal  Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history)  available from our records and other sources. “Personal Information”  includes usernames, e-mail addresses, wireless addresses, credit card  and other payment information, purchase history, demographic  information, and/or other information that may identify you as an  individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.  This information is used by Joy Sky to fulfill your requests and for  marketing and research purposes. This information will not be shared  with other marketers to bring you offers of interest. Certain areas of Joy Sky’s Web Site may require user registration in order to gain  access; once you register with the Joy Sky Web Site to use that content,  you will no longer be anonymous to us.</p>
<h3>Right to Opt Out</h3>
<p>You have the right to opt out of certain of our uses of your  Personal Information. For example, at the time you are requested to  provide Personal Information on this Web Site, you may have the  opportunity to elect to, or not to receive correspondence from us. You  may make this request  by electing to not receive our e-mail newsletter notifications during  your registration process. Furthermore, all of our correspondence will  include a link to Opt Out of future newsletters and/or notifications. In  this e-mail, please say whether: (i) you would like to opt out of  receiving promotional correspondence from Joy Sky in general, or just  via e-mail, postal mail, short message service (SMS), instant messaging,  and/or by phone, and/or (ii) you would only like to opt out of certain  of Joy Sky’s e-newsletters or correspondence, and if so which ones. You  may also opt out of Joy Sky’s promotional e-mails by clicking on an  opt-out link within the e-mail you receive.</p>
<p>Please understand that if you opt out of receiving correspondence  from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship,  activities, transactions and communications with us.</p>
<h3>Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>Joy Sky may use “cookie” technology to enhance a visitor’s online  experience by making it easier to navigate through our Web Site or to  make an activity work better.</p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information or data files that are  sent through your browser or related software from a Web server and are  stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies may be used to track where  you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase, and they  allow a computer to “remember” information from our Web Site for future  use. The use of cookies is an industry standard and is practiced by most  major Web sites. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are, but  they may enable us to relate your use of our Web Site to other  information, including your Personal Information, which you have  provided to us when you registered for notification about one of our  products or purchased a product from us by visiting our Web Site. All of  these purposes serve to enhance your experience while using our  services in the ways described below.</p>
<p>Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been  sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer,  your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However,  refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or  negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain  areas or features of the Web Site.</p>
<p>Joy Sky also may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel  tags”) or similar technologies, in the Web Site and/or in our  communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a  web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel,  transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located  on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is  retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification  of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear  gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or  message to other information about you, including your Personal  Information.</p>
<p>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<p>Keeping count of return visits to our Web Site or our advertisers’ or partners’ sites<br>
Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in  mass), statistical information on website and advertisement usage<br>
Determining which features our customers like best<br>
IP Address and “Clickstream” Data</p>
<p>Our server automatically collects data about your server’s  Internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an  Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s  automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service  provider whenever you’re on the Internet. When you request pages from  our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your  domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked  you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you  visit on this Web Site; the Web site you visit after this Web Site; the  ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web  browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are  using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral  site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.  We use this information for internal system administration, to help  diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Such  information may also be used to gather broad demographic information,  such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We reserve the  right to link this information with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Web site usage  information (i.e., information gathered through the use of cookies, Web  bugs and clickstream data) may be performed on our behalf by our  services providers.</p>
<h3>How Joy Sky Uses Personal Information</h3>
<p>Personal Information is used to enhance and custom-tailor each  user’s experience on the Web Site. Such information will also be used,  for example, to process your orders, respond to your requests and  inquiries and provide you with the services and features offered on or  through our Web Site.</p>
<p>Joy Sky may also use Personal Information to maintain our internal  record keeping. We reserve the right to match information collected  from you through different means or at different times, including both  Personal Information and Web Site usage information, and use such  information along with information obtained from other sources. In  addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails,  mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about  products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others,  that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving such  notices from us by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out  section above.</p>
<p>In addition, Joy Sky may use Personal Information to generate aggregate data about our Web Site’s visitors.</p>
<h3>Requests For Feedback</h3>
<p>Joy Sky may request feedback from visitors to the Web Site  regarding an activity or piece of content on the Web Site. Such feedback  is used for internal purposes only.</p>
<h3>How Joy Sky Shares Information Collected Online</h3>
<p>Joy Sky will not sell, rent or give a visitor’s Personal  Information to any third party unless required to do so by operation of  the law or in order to protect the users of the Web Site or in the  limited circumstances required in order to correct an error regarding a  players account; in such case, Joy Sky will only share as much  information as is necessary and only with its parent or affiliated  partners in order to remedy any errors. Notwithstanding the above, Joy Sky may, however, share aggregate information about users of our Web  Site, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not  describe or identify any individual user, with our advertisers, business  partners, sponsors and certain others, as further described herein. As  mentioned above, this aggregate information is used to develop, improve  and customize Joy Sky’s Web Site to better serve visitors to our Web  Site.</p>
<h3>Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings</h3>
<p>Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be  co-sponsored by another company. In those situations, we may share the  information we obtain from you in connection with such contest,  sweepstake or offering with our co-sponsor, unless you instruct us not  to by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section above.  In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your  information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own  policies. We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors may use your  information.</p>
<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We may use third party partners to help operate our Web Site and  deliver our products and services, and may share your information with  our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide  products or services for or through this Web Site or for our business  (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting  companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution  companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers  that use such information on our behalf).</p>
<h3>Legally Compelled Disclosures</h3>
<p>We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to  other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities,  at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law,  including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.  We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe  that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or  property, other users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be  harmed by such activities. We may also report information about your  account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other  defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.</p>
<h3>Business Transfer</h3>
<p>In the event that Joy Sky, or substantially all of its assets, is  acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition,  merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, Personal  Information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<h3>Wireless Addresses</h3>
<p>If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail  address, you agree to receive messages at such address from Joy Sky. You  understand that your wireless carrier’s standard or premium rates apply  to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by  following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section above. You  represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless  device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized  to approve the applicable charges.</p>
<h3>Advertisers and Third Party “Linked-To” Web Sites</h3>
<p>Joy Sky may include advertisements and/or links to web sites  operated by third parties that are not sponsors and are not affiliated  with Joy Sky. Joy Sky tries to make sure that when there are links off  the Web Site, they are working and lead visitors to interesting, fun and  informative areas. However, it is hard to guarantee what exactly is  presented on other Web sites or where links elsewhere may lead. Joy Sky  is not responsible for the content, practices, or information provided  or requested on Web sites operated by third parties. Further,  advertisements on and links to or from callofgods.com do not constitute  sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Joy Sky of the content,  policies, practices or products or services offered on these Web sites.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians should check each Web site’s privacy policy and  terms of use in order to understand their policies and practices  regarding the collection and use of personally identifiable information. Joy Sky also suggests that parents/guardians review the privacy  policies of all Web sites that their children visit, including those Web  sites linking to or from the Joy Sky Web Site. Information provided to  those web sites will be subject to the privacy policy posted at that web  site.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The importance of security for all Personal Information associated  with visitors to our Web Site is of utmost concern to us. Joy Sky  exercises great care and implements a variety of technologies in an  effort to help make the Joy Sky Web Site secure against unauthorized  access and to protect the Personal Information visitors choose to  provide to us. Joy Sky periodically reviews and updates these measures.  Unfortunately, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open  global communications vehicle, no data transmission over the Internet  can be guaranteed to be secure, and Joy Sky cannot guarantee that  information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on  our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from  intrusion by others, such as hackers. As a result, while Joy Sky strives  to protect a visitor’s Personal Information, Joy Sky cannot ensure or  warrant the security of any information transmitted to us or from our  online products or services, and a visitor does so at his/her own risk. Joy Sky&nbsp; uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption  when credit card information is transmitted to us.</p>
<p>If you contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature  on our Web site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be  secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods  in transit.</p>
<p>We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due  to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after  transmission.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your  Personal Information in our possession or control may have been  compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a  notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as  possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail  address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail  as a means of such notification.</p>
<h3>Review and deletion of personal information</h3>
<p>You may review and delete the Personal Information about you that  is contained in your user account at Joy Sky at any time.</p>
<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become  increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages  to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a  bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal,  often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail  address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain  name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the  domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive  information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for  purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known  as “phishing.”</p>
<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that  you provide any sensitive information (including your Web Site password  or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not  seem to be affiliated with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems  suspicious to you, please do not provide such information.</p>
<h3>Consent to Processing</h3>
<p>By providing Personal Information to this Web Site, you understand  and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of  such information in and to the United States and other countries and  territories.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Joy Sky reserves the right to change or update this Privacy  Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time, and will  notify users of this Web Site by posting such changed or updated  Privacy Policy on this page. Any changes or updates will be effective  immediately upon posting to this Web Site. Under certain circumstances,  we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy  Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page  of our Web Site to sending you an e-mail.</p>
