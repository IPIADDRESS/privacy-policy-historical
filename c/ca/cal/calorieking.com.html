your own risk.</p>

<p>In the event of a complaint, we may receive personal information about you from other
parties in our Network, other Users or third parties who may communicate information to
us about you in relation to that complaint.</p>

personal information over the Internet, whether to us or anyone else. This includes
making purchases.</p>

<p>We encourage all parents and guardians to make themselves aware of what their children
are up to on the Internet and discuss privacy and safety issues with them. Public
discussion areas on the Network are not private. Any information posted by your child in
such areas may be seen, collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited

instruct your child not to post any such information without first seeking your permission.
Children post at their own risk!</p>
