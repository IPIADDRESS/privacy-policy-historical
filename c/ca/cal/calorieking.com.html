<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your personal information is important to CalorieKing.com.</p>

<p>CalorieKing.com understands that the privacy of your personal information is very
important to you. It is important to us too!</p>

<p>The following policies will govern how CalorieKing.com manages your personal
information and protects your privacy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and
subject to our Terms of Use, which you should refer to for additional information relating
to privacy issues.</p>

<h3>1.	Collecting Information About You</h3>

<p>CalorieKing.com will not collect or monitor personal information about you without your

Users, Network Subscribers and Members or any other individual or entity,
including members of the public</li>

<li>to provide services to you</li>
</ul>

<p>CalorieKing.com will only collect personal information which has been obtained from you.
The amount of information will depend on you! You may provide us or an Affiliate with
information:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you register with or subscribe to the Network or email lists</li>
<li>by identifying yourself when you use the Network</li>

Use. Any information you post in such areas may be seen, collected and used by others
and may result in unsolicited messages. CalorieKing.com cannot control this. You post at
your own risk.</p>

<p>In the event of a complaint, we may receive personal information about you from other
parties in our Network, other Users or third parties who may communicate information to
us about you in relation to that complaint.</p>

<p>CalorieKing.com uses Cookies and other tracking methods to allow the provision of certain
services and to maximize your enjoyment of the Network. We do not link this
information back to other information that you have provided to us, and CalorieKing.com
does not store any information inside Cookies. Any collection of personal information
other than that mentioned here will require your consent.</p>

disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies do not personally identify Users, although
they do identify a User's browser. Most Web browsers are set to accept Cookies,
although you can reset your browser to refuse. </p>

<p>Cookies and IP addresses can enhance your enjoyment of the Network by allowing us to

enhanced services. Refusing to accept Cookies may prevent you from fully utilizing some
of these services.</p>

Users on an aggregate basis. This does not include personal information about you.</p>

<p>By recognizing how all of our Users utilize the Network and what they find interesting, 
we can focus our resources on features that are the most popular and
beneficial to our Users, and provide continuously-improving services for everyone!</p>

<h3>2.	Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>

<p>CalorieKing.com will not use or disclose any personal information about you without your
consent, or access your communications on the Network, unless we consider it is
necessary:</p>

<ul>
<li>to comply with the law</li>

<li>to protect the rights and/or property of CalorieKing.com, the Network, Network
Users, Network Subscribers and Members or any other individual or entity,
including members of the public</li>

postcard or when you order merchandise. In these cases, again, your choice to disclose
personal information is voluntary. </p>

personal information over the Internet, whether to us or anyone else. This includes
making purchases.</p>

<p>We encourage all parents and guardians to make themselves aware of what their children
are up to on the Internet and discuss privacy and safety issues with them. Public
discussion areas on the Network are not private. Any information posted by your child in
such areas may be seen, collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited
messages or other unwanted attention! CalorieKing.com cannot control this. You should
instruct your child not to post any such information without first seeking your permission.
Children post at their own risk!</p>
