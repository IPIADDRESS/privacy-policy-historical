If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our products, Sites and/ or Services and in any manner consistent with the policies provided herein.</span></div></div><div class="subsubsection"><h4 class="subsubsection-title">Posting on the Site</h4><div class="subsubsection-body">• <span>Calm may offer publicly accessible fun pages, blogs, private messages, or community forums. You should be aware that, when you disclose information about yourself in on Calm’s fun pages, blogs, private messages, and community forums, the Site will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content to any public area of the Site, such content will be considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.</span></div></div><div class="subsubsection"><h4 class="subsubsection-title">Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests</h4><div class="subsubsection-body">• <span>Occasionally, we may run sweepstakes and contests. We ask those who enter in the sweepstakes or contests to provide contact information (e.g., an e-mail address). If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. All sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt-out of any communications that are not related to awarding prizes.</span></div></div><div class="subsubsection"><h4 class="subsubsection-title">Automatic Data Collection</h4><div class="subsubsection-body">• <span>We may collect certain information automatically through our Services or other methods of web analysis, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, Advertiser ID, Game Center ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geolocation information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="subsection"><h3 class="subsection-title">Information Submitted Via Services</h3><div class="subsection-body"><span>You agree that Calm is free to use the content of any communications submitted by you via the Services, including any ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services. We will not release your name or otherwise publicize the fact that you submitted materials or other information to us unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first send notice to you that the materials or other information you submit to a particular part of a Service will be published or otherwise used with your name on it; or (c) we are required to do so by law.</span></div></div><div class="subsection"><h3 class="subsection-title">Information from Other Sources</h3><div class="subsection-body"><span>We may receive information about you from other sources, including through third party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. For example, if you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and other Personal Information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Services or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered Personal Information because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Calm and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Services.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</h2><div class="section-body"><div class="subsection"><h3 class="subsection-title"></h3><div class="subsection-body"><span>Like many website owners and operators, we, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices. We use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</span></div></div><div class="subsection"><h3 class="subsection-title"></h3><div class="subsection-body"><div class="subsubsection"><h4 class="subsubsection-title">Cookies</h4><div class="subsubsection-body">• <span>“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your device.

Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</span></div></div><div class="subsubsection"><h4 class="subsubsection-title">Widgets</h4><div class="subsubsection-body">• <span>“Social Media Widgets” such as the Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive miniprograms) may be on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</span></div></div><div class="subsubsection"><h4 class="subsubsection-title">Analytics</h4><div class="subsubsection-body">• <span>We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content.

We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Social Media Platforms</h2><div class="section-body"><div class="subsection"><h3 class="subsection-title"></h3><div class="subsection-body"><span>Calm’s Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or private messaging features.
