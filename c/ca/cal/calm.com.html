If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Services or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</div></div><div class="subsection" data-reactid="29"><h3 class="subsection-title" data-reactid="30">Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</h3><div class="subsection-body" data-reactid="31">Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.  “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.  “Web Beacons” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</div></div><div class="subsection" data-reactid="32"><h3 class="subsection-title" data-reactid="33">Information Related to Use of the Services</h3><div class="subsection-body" data-reactid="34">Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</div></div><div class="subsection" data-reactid="35"><h3 class="subsection-title" data-reactid="36">Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</h3><div class="subsection-body" data-reactid="37">We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</div></div><div class="subsection" data-reactid="38"><h3 class="subsection-title" data-reactid="39">Location Information</h3><div class="subsection-body" data-reactid="40">In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.  If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</div></div></div></div><div class="section" data-reactid="41"><h2 class="section-title" data-reactid="42">Information That We Share With Third Parties</h2><div class="section-body" data-reactid="43"><div class="subsection" data-reactid="44"><h3 class="subsection-title" data-reactid="45"></h3><div class="subsection-body" data-reactid="46">We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</div></div><div class="subsection" data-reactid="47"><h3 class="subsection-title" data-reactid="48">Information Shared with Our Services Providers</h3><div class="subsection-body" data-reactid="49"><!-- react-text: 50 -->We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services.
