We want you to feel confident using Modernize.com to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. </p>
<p><b>Blogs, Bulletin Boards, Twitter Account and Chat Rooms</b></p>
<p>We may provide areas on Modernize.com where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post comments (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our <a href="http://www.modernize.com/terms">Terms and</a> Conditions. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address or twitter account, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. </p>
<p><b>Children’s Privacy</b></p>
<p>Modernize.com is a general audience Website, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@modernize.com">support@modernize.com</a>, and we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account. </p>
<p><b>Visiting Modernize.com From Outside the United States </b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on Modernize.com from residents of the United States. If you are visiting Modernize.com from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy. </p>
<p><b>No Rights of Third Parties</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Website.</p>
<p><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on Modernize.com. We recommend that you check Modernize.com from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies. </p>
<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights </b></p>
<p>If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties. California law gives you the right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the following information: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year;</li>
<li>the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information; and</li>
<li>if the nature of the third party’s business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the products or services marketed.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may provide this information in a standardized format that is not specific to you. The designated email address for these requests is <a href="mailto:support@modernize.com">support@modernize.com</a>. </p>
<p><b>Linked Information</b><a name="cookies"></a></p>
<p>Cookies: A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate Modernize.com. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of Modernize.com may not function properly. We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Website. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Modernize.com does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). <a name="web_beacons"></a></p>
<p>Web Beacons: Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>
<p><b>How to Contact Us</b></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by regular mail at Privacy Policy Inquiry, Modernize.com, 804 Congress Avenue, Suite 400, Austin, Texas 78701 or email us at <a href="mailto:support@modernize.com">support@modernize.com</a>. </p>
