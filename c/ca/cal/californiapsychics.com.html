<p><strong>Disclosure Regarding Collection and Use of Personal Information<br>
  Last Updated November 8, 2005</strong></p>
<p> Thank you for visiting CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM. This notice explains our online 
  information collection and use practices and the choices you can make about 
  the way we use and share such information. Please take the time to read and 
  understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY </strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS SERVICE IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN 
  YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER TO USE THE PREMIUM AREAS OF THIS SERVICE. ALL CREDIT CARD 
  PURCHASES MUST BE MADE BY THE CARD HOLDER. AT CALIFORNIA PSYCHICS WE WANT YOU 
  TO ENJOY AND BENEFIT FROM YOUR READING. OUR PSYCHICS MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE 
  YOU WITH HELPFUL ADVICE. HOWEVER, THIS INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PLACE 
  OF ANY RECOMMENDATIONS BY MEDICAL OR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONALS OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL 
  COUNSELORS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO EVALUATE ANY INFORMATION, OPINION, 
  ADVICE OR OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH CALIFORNIA PSYCHICS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Information We Collect.</strong><br>
  At CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM you can do a variety of things! You may be able to 
  talk to a psychic, enter contests, participate in surveys, subscribe to a service 
  (like our horoscopes), take quizzes, post to message boards, or participate 
  in a chat room. The types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information 
  that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted) that 
  may be collected at these pages includes: name, address, age, date of birth, 
  sex, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, 
  and information about your interests in and use of various services. You can 
  view or change your information at any time. Click here to edit your profile 
  or send an email to <a href="mailto:info@californiapsychics.com">info@californiapsychics.com</a>.</p>
<p> We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e. 
  generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any 
  of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, 
  Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 
  2000 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., 
  America Online or Earthlink). </p>
<p> <strong>How We Use and Disclose the Information.</strong><br>
  We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) you 
  have submitted. Examples of us using your personal information for the purpose(s) 
  submitted include if you sign up for horoscopes, we will send to an e-mail with 
  your horoscope for the day or, if you have won a contest, sending to you an 
  email notification that you have won. In addition, we may send to you an e-mail 
  offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to 
  ask you to participate in a survey. If you want us to stop using the personal 
  information you provided in these ways, please contact us at info@californiaspsychics.com. 
</p>
<p><strong>How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong><br>
  We will not share the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for 
  the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required 
  by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury 
  (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement 
  agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) 
  injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); (d) with 
  other persons or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site 
  operations or our business activities (for example, third party contractors 
  - see below); and/or (e) notifying you when we make changes to one of our subscriber 
  agreements or this policy. Our business needs may change from time to time and 
  we reserve the right to make changes to our Privacy Policy. We will not use 
  your personal information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, 
  however, without first obtaining your consent to do so. </p>
<p> If intended uses differ from this Policy, we will seek to obtain your consent 
  at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" 
  or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an 
  e-mail).</p>
<p> Our operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to 
  your personally identifiable information in the course of providing products 
  or services to Outlook Amusements, Inc. These contractors include vendors and 
  suppliers that provide us with credit card processing, e-mail distribution technology, 
  services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site. 
  Access to your personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited 
  to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited 
  function for Outlook Amusements, Inc. We also contractually require that our 
  operations and maintenance contractors 1) protect the privacy of your personally 
  identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not use 
  or disclose your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than 
  providing us with products and services as required by law. </p>
<p> CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM is committed to handling your customer information 
  with high standards of information security. We are VeriSign secured and we 
  maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal 
  regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. </p>
<p> <strong>Our Psychics/Your Privacy</strong><br>
  <strong>Note that our psychics are independent contractors and not employed 
  directly by Outlook Amusements, Inc. We contractually require that our psychics 
  protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy 
  Policy and not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other 
  than providing you with the services you request through the Web site or by 
  phone. You should also take care to protect your personal information and privacy. 
  There is no reason that you should provide any of our psychics with personal 
  contact information, specific financial information including but not limited 
  to account numbers, or other confidential information related to your identity. 
  It is a violation of our <a href="terms_of_Service.aspx">Terms of Use</a> for you to 
  be in direct contact with any of our psychics outside the online service – 
  if you do so, Outlook Amusements, Inc. bears no liability for any resulting 
  actions, and your ability to use our services may be revoked.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information. </strong><br>
  We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect 
  to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize 
  your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate 
  to analyze how our site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs 
  or services. We may also share aggregate information with others, including 
  affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collection of Information by Others.</strong><br>
  Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be 
  different than ours. You should check the other sites' privacy notices since 
  we have no control over information that is submitted to or collected by them.</p>
<p> <strong>Cookies.</strong><br>
  To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies." 
  Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your 
  preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other 
  personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information 
  to us. However, once you choose to provide the personally identifiable information, 
  this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot 
  be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
<p> We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how 
  our site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For 
  example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages 
  or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize 
  you by name when you return to our site). You can opt to have your browser reject 
  cookies without any effect on your use of our site. If you do that, you may 
  need to re-register with us every time you visit our site in order to participate 
  in certain promotions. You should also know that companies that advertise on 
  our web site (and their agents) might use their own cookies. This policy does 
  not cover how these companies use their cookies.</p>
<p> <strong>Web Beacons.</strong><br>
  Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which 
  are also called single-pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users who 
  have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are 
  not used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a technique 
  we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web beacons 
  collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and 
  date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. 
  Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there to help us determine 
  the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</p>
<p> <strong>Clickstream Data.</strong><br>
  As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web 
  site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream 
  data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream 
  data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the 
  address of the web site from which you linked to CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM. We 
  may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally identifiable information 
  to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM, 
  how visitors navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages 
  to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to 
  improve our site. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous 
  and aggregate.</p>
<p> <strong>Discussions and Community Tools; Testimonials.</strong><br>
  You agree that any information you submit to us through CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM 
  may be used for promotional purposes. Because of the public nature of some of 
  our services, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal 
  information. We may also use a limited amount of information, such as first 
  name, last initial and your town and state in marketing materials on the website. 
  Your registration constitutes consent to this use.</p>
<p> <strong>International Users.</strong><br>
  If you are visiting CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM from a location outside of the United 
  States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United 
  States, and all information you provide will be processed and securely maintained 
  in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. By 
  using CALIFORNIAPSYCHICS.COM, you authorize and specifically consent to the 
  export of your personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified 
  above when you provide such information to us. This policy and our legal obligations 
  are subject to the laws of the State of California and the USA, regardless of 
  the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the USA 
  in the State of California.</p>
<p> <strong>How You Can Access or Correct Your Personal Information.</strong><br>
  For instructions on how you can access the personally identifiable information 
  that we have collected about you online, or how to correct any errors in such 
  information, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@californiapsychics.com">info@californiapsychics.com</a></p>

  <strong>
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS </strong> 
<p>Outlook Amusements, Inc. collects various types of personal information about 
  you, both online and offline, during the course of our business relationship. 
  Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written 
  request to Outlook Amusements, Inc. for information about how we have shared 
  your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes 
  during the prior calendar year, as well as a list of categories of information 
  shared. For purposes of this California Privacy Rights notice, third parties 
  include companies within our “family” of companies, such as those 
  companies we own, that own us, or under common control with us.</p>
<p>Under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists 
  if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its <a href="#top">Privacy 
  Policy</a>) a policy of not disclosing customer personal information to third 
  parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively 
  agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this 
  policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer 
  of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing 
  a cost-free means to exercise that right.</p>
<p> As stated in our <a href="#top">Privacy Policy</a>, 
  we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes 
  unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in 
  to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes 
  or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your information 
  with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information 
  in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with 
  any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal 
  information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such 
  use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. 
  Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a 
  third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. 
  If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, 
  you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over 
  how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy 
  of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will 
  handle your information.</p>
<p> California customers may request further information about our compliance 
  with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:info@californiapsychics.com">info@californiapsychics.com</a>. 
  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer 
  each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other 
  than through this e-mail address.<br>
</p></div>
