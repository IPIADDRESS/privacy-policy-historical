                (for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request, when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury 
                to or interference with the rights or property of another, or when we believe that someone has violated our  <a href="http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/Terms-of-Service.aspx">Terms and Conditions</a>); (d) with other persons or companies with 
                whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, third party contractors - see below); and/or (e) notifying you when we make changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy.

				As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets
                 but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).   The personal information you provide is considered 
                 a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if California Psychics, any or all of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of their assets, is ever acquired by a third party.

				<strong>Sharing with Service Providers</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
				Our operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your personally identifiable information in the course of providing products or services to California Psychics. 
                These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with credit card processing, e-mail distribution technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our Web site. 
                Access to your personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for California Psychics. 
                We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors 1) protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not use or disclose 
                your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services as required by law.

				<strong>Our Psychics/Your Privacy</strong>
            </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note that our psychics are independent contractors and not employed directly by California Psychics. We contractually require that our psychics protect the privacy of your personal 
                information consistent with this Privacy Policy and not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing you with the services you request through the Web site or by phone. 
                You should also take care to protect your personal information and privacy. There is no reason that you should provide any of our psychics with personal contact information, 
                specific financial information including but not limited to account numbers, or other confidential information related to your identity. It is a violation of our <a href="http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/Terms-of-Service.aspx">Terms of Use</a>
                 for you to be in direct contact with any of our psychics outside the online service – if you do so, California Psychics bears no liability for any resulting actions, and your ability to use our services may be revoked.</strong>

				<strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                California Psychics collects various types of personal information about you, both online and offline, during the course of our business relationship. Under California law, if you are a resident 
                of California, you may make a written request to California Psychics for information about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes 
                during the prior calendar year, as well as a list of categories of information shared. For purposes of this California Privacy Rights notice, third parties include companies within our “family” of companies, 
                such as those companies we own, that own us, or under common control with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its <a href="http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/privacy-policy.aspx#top">Privacy Policy</a>) 
                a policy of not disclosing customer personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. 
                Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that right.
            </p> 
             <p>
                As stated in our <a href="http://www.californiapsychics.com/about/privacy-policy.aspx#top">Privacy Policy</a>, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information 
                from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, 
                we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information 
                for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications 
                from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, 
                as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
            </p> 
            <p>
                California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:Privacy@californiapsychics.com">Privacy@californiapsychics.com</a>. 
                Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
            </p>
