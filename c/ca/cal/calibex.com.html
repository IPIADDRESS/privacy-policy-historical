<br>

<p>
NexTag, Inc. ("NexTag") operates the websites, <a href="http://www.nextag.com">www.nextag.com</a>, <a href="http://www.calibex.com">www.calibex.com</a>, <a href="http://www.techpricesonline.com">www.techpricesonline.com</a>, as well as other affiliated websites, all of which are comparison-shopping
site with related services (the "Websites").  NexTag respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your
information with us. This Privacy Policy Statement is designed to inform you of the types of information we collect from our
customers, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties.
</p>

<p>
NexTag, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose
mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal
identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This Privacy Policy Statement covers the Websites.  Because Nextag wants to demonstrate its commitment to our
users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for
compliance by TRUSTe.
</p>

<p>
This is a new privacy policy statement, effective as of the date listed above.  Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior policy statement, you
need to review this updated version. This document is merely a disclosure of our current practices. It is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations for any party. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy Statement as any time and at our discretion.
</p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Notification of Changes</b></div>
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy Statement, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy Statement, the homepage of the
Websites, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use
it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via
either email or by posting a notice on the Websites for 30 days.
<p></p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b></div>
We understand you may not want to receive email from us or from our partners and advertisers. You can choose to opt-out
of receiving email communications from us or our partners and advertisers by selecting to opt out if and when you
register on our Websites, by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email communication or by contacting the
partner or advertiser directly.
<p></p>

<p>
To opt out of receiving all other NexTag mailings after you have registered, send an email to:
<a href="javascript:mailTo('usersupport','nextag.com',null);">privacy@nextag.com</a> or click the unsubscribe link
contained within the email that you receive. Please note that opting out will prevent you from receiving email from
NexTag regarding updates and improvements to the Websites or offers and promotions we may be offering.
</p>

<p>
In some cases we request that you submit personal information in order to forward this information to our partners that
have products or services in which you have indicated an interest. In the event you agree to submit such information
and authorize us to share this information with our partners (e.g., Lenders or car dealers), we no longer have control
over the use of such information and your rights regarding such use will be governed by the policies of our partners.
</p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Accessing and Changing your Personal Information</b></div>
For registered users, you can review your personal identifiable information by logging in with your email and password
and then clicking on the "My Account" link located at the top right of each page. After accessing your My Account page,
click the links under the General Account Information section to make changes as necessary.
<p></p>

<p>
Please note: Though we store encrypted credit card information for transactional purposes, we do not display it for
review as part of your online account information. If you would like to review this or any further information offline,
please feel free to <a href="../../about/contact_us.jsp">contact us.</a>
</p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Confidentiality and Security</b></div>
We restrict access to your nonpublic personal information to those NexTag employees and agents who need to know that
information to provide services to our users
<p></p>

<p>
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic
personal information.  Further, we employ Secure Socket Layer technology in transmitting certain sensitive information
(e.g. credit card or personally identifiable information) from you to us and from us to our partners.
</p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Personal Information</b></div>
Users have the option of providing various types of personal information to make the best use of our Websites.  Providing
personal information is voluntary.  This section describes what we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it.
We only disclose information in compliance with applicable laws. By providing this information, you agree to its use
consistent with this policy.
<p></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Zip Code Only:</b> On our comparison shopping sites, you have the choice of providing your zip code.  We use your
zip code to compute total price including the cost of shipping and sales tax.  We do not share this information with
third parties.
</p>

<p>
<b>E-mail Address Only:</b> If you wish to register for either Price Alerts (through our Watch List feature) or our
Buyer's Alert Newsletter, we require that you provide us with your email address. We do not share these e-mail addresses
with third parties.
</p>

<p>
<b>Basic Contact Info:</b> When a visitor decides to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact
information, such as username, zip code, and email address. We use this basic contact information to facilitate the use
of certain features of our Websites (e.g., total price and submission of seller reviews) and to send the user information
about our company. We also use email addresses to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers.  We
do not share this basic contact information with third parties.
</p>

<p>
<b>Complete Contact Info:</b> When a user wishes to be contacted by a merchant, such as an auto dealer in their local
area, we collect full name, e-mail address, and phone number.  NexTag forwards this personal information on to
appropriate merchants.
</p>

<p>
When a registered user decides to become a seller, we collect complete contact information, i.e., full name, address,
e-mail address, and phone number, as well as credit card number and expiration date.  We use this information to
validate the seller's identity and to bill the seller for services provided by NexTag and approved in advance by the
seller.  All credit card information is encrypted. With the exception of our credit card processing service, we will not
share your credit card information with third parties without your approval. The credit card processing company may
retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for their internal purposes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Service User Information:</b> When a user wants to receive information about, mortgages, real estate services, personal finance, or
insurance, NexTag requests that Service Users complete a questionnaire, which includes personal financial and contact
information ("Service User Information").  Service User Information enables NexTag to provide Service Users with
information about requested services.  We do not provide a means of updating Service User Information. Any updates
should be provided directly to the Service Providers that contact the Service User.
</p>

<p>
In the questionnaire, we obtain consent from a Service User to disclose Service User Information to Service Providers,
such as participating banks, mortgage brokers, loan brokers and financial institutions 
(collectively, "Lenders"), as well as real estate brokers, insurance companies, and insurance agents.  In the
questionnaire, we state that we cannot provide our services without such consent.  When a Service User provides consent,
we will disclose Service User Information only authorized and permitted by applicable laws. By providing consent, the Service User authorizes us to disclose Service User Information to Lenders and/or other Service Providers and is expressly consenting to be contacted by Lenders and/or other Service Providers, including by phone and email (and such consent is effective even if the Service User is registered on any federal, state, trade association, or corporate Do-Not-Call Registry).   
</p>

<p>
NexTag does not have
control over the use of Service User Information by the Lenders and other Service Providers, however.  The Service
User's rights regarding such use will be governed by the policies of the Lenders or other Service Providers with whom
the information is shared. After the Service User has left our Websites, we continue to treat Service User Information as
confidential and do not disclose it to third parties other than as authorized by the Service User and explained in our
Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Use of Personal Information </b></div>
In addition to the uses described above, we may use your personal information:
<ul>
	<li>To forward to merchants that offer the products or service a user is interested in.</li>
	<li>To contact a user in response to a customer service question from the user or to resolve a dispute between users.</li>
	<li>To process credit card payments approved in advance by a user.</li>
	<li>To allow a user to send an email to another user who is listing an item for sale on our site.</li>
	<li>To share information about the Site if the user opts in to receive such communications.</li>
	<li>To distribute occasional promotional material from our partners and advertisers if the user opts in to receive such communications.</li>
	<li>To assist law enforcement or other governmental agencies investigating cases of possible illegal activities by third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Aggregate Information</b></div>
NexTag may share aggregated activity or statistical information with partners, advertisers or others, but that
information that does not contain personally identifiable information.  We collect certain information through the Web
site experience and activities, cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.
A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences, activities and
interactions with NexTag.   Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable
information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user.  This profile is used to tailor a user's
visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions and communications to them.
<p></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Cookies</b></div>
A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer. We use both session
cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer
until manually deleted.
<p></p>

<p>
Cookies are used to help make your use of our Websites more enjoyable. NexTag creates these cookie files on your hard
drive through your browser and uses them to save information on your NexTag username, zip code and Website preferences
so you can avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our Websites. Cookies also help us to deliver content
specific to your interests. You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this may prevent
you from accessing certain features on our Websites.
</p>

<p>
<b>NexTag does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.</b>
</p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Log Files</b></div>
Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type,
internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze
trends, administer the Web site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use.  We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and
demographic information on who uses our Websites. We may provide third parties with statistics about our users, traffic
patterns and related Website information. This data is collected from millions of user visits to our Websites each month
and does not contain any personally identifiable information.
<p></p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Clear Gifs</b>(Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</div>
We employ and/or our third party advertisers employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons
or Web Bugs).  They help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content and which campaigns are
effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the size of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier.
Clear gifs are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users. <p></p>

<p>
</p><div class="dr"><b>Third Party Advertising</b></div>
Third parties displaying advertisements on our Websites may also use cookies or clear gifs. NexTag does not control the
use of cookies and clear gifs by third parties. The use of cookies and clear gifs by these companies is subject to their
own privacy policies, which you may review by visiting their websites.  Any information that these third parties collect
via cookies and clear gifs is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your
choices, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.  Currently, NexTag has
relationships with the following third party advertising networks, <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/">Doubleclick,
Inc</a>. and <a href="http://www.worldata.com/">WebConnect, Inc</a>.
<p></p>

<p>
In addition, NexTag and its advertisers use may clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This allows us to gauge the
effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns by showing how may emails have
been opened by the recipients. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Choice/Opt-out section.
