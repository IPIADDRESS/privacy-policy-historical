These legitimate interests relate to the development of the Calaméo platform and the publication and sharing of interactive documents with a growing public audience, across the world.
</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<h2 id="what">What personal information do we collect on our site?</h2>
<p>
When you use our services, we collect personally identifiable information in several ways:
</p>
<h3>Personal data that we collect directly from you</h3>

You may also choose to disclose the URL of your website.

</p>
<p>
If you contact our Support service in order to obtain an answer to a question you have regarding the use of the Calaméo platform, we retain the question and its answer in our knowledge base so as to enrich it and improve future answers.
</p>
<h3>Personal data that we collect indirectly</h3>
<p>
If you wish to create your Calaméo account via a social network such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Google+, the following information is collection from your account and stored by Calaméo: your email address, your first name, last name, and public profile photo.
</p>
<h3>Personal data collected automatically when you use our services: our Cookie Policy</h3>
<p>
The personally identifiable information collected by Calaméo may be combined with operational data that we collect or that is collected by our processors using various technologies (cookies) while you browse our site.
</p>
<h4>What is a cookie and what does it do?</h4>
<p>
The cookie is a record of information placed on your computer or mobile device in order to simplify, optimize and render more secure your navigation on our site. These cookies do not identify you personally, but they do allow their sender to recognize your device and to collect certain information regarding your navigation. They cannot contain viruses.
</p>
<h4>What information is recorded when I browse?</h4>
<p>
The data collected in “log” files (IP address, browser type, browser language, pages visited) is information regarding site usage. This information is used to provide site features and functions (for example, the readership statistics provided to users). Although this data is not anonymized, it is always processed collectively.
</p>
<p>
Marketing tracers (cookies) only collect information when you visit the “Pricing,” “Features” and “About” pages while logged into your Calaméo account. They do not collect any information regarding publications that you have viewed.
</p>
<p>
These two sets of data are never combined for analysis.
</p>
<p>
Cookies are valid for a maximum duration of 13 months.

<b>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS CALAMEO IN ANY MANNER.</b>
</p>
<p>
The Calaméo service is not open to minors under the age of 13 and Calaméo collects no personally identifiable information regarding any person under the age of 13. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor under the age of 13 who has become a member of Calaméo, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@calameo.com">privacy@calameo.com</a> so that his/her account can be closed and the data erased.
</p>
<p>
If a minor between the ages of 13 and 15 wishes to register on Calaméo, this registration will only be legal if consent is jointly granted by the minor in question and the holder(s) of parental authority over this minor. The holder(s) of parental authority must transmit photo identification and proof of their relationship with the minor.
</p>
<p>
Above the age of 15, a minor may register independently on Calaméo and consent to the processing of his/her personal data.
</p>
<p>
Minors have a broadened right to erase personal data collected during their minority. For more information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@calameo.com">privacy@calameo.com</a>.
