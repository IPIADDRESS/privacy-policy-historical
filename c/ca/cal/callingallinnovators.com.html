Nokia does not knowingly collect information of children without the consent of their parents or guardians. Nokia publishes safety guidelines for using internet services in our websites.</span></p><p></p><h2 class="nk-headline-2"><span xml:lang="EN-US">How Do We Address Data Quality?</span></h2><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">We take reasonable steps to keep the personal data we possess accurate and to delete incorrect or unnecessary personal data.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">As certain Nokia products and services may allow you to manage your profile, we encourage you to access your personal data from time to time to ensure that it is correct. Please remember that in case of any changes it is your responsibility to update the personal data you have provided us with.</span></p><h2 class="nk-headline-2"><span xml:lang="EN-US">What Steps Are Taken To Safeguard Personal Data?</span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Privacy and security are key considerations in the creation and delivery of our products and services. We have assigned specific responsibilities to address privacy and security related matters. We enforce our internal policies and guidelines through an appropriate selection of activities, including proactive and reactive risk management, security engineering, training and assessments. We take appropriate steps to address online security, physical security, risk of data loss and other such risks taking into consideration the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the data being protected. Also, we limit access to our data bases containing personal data to authorized persons having a justified need to access such information.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="nk-headline-2"><span xml:lang="EN-US">How Do We Use Cookies and Web Beacons?</span></h2><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Cookies are small text files that are sent to your computer by a web server. We use cookies to provide benefits to you. Session cookies remember the previous activity performed by you, for example an item you placed in a shopping cart. Persistent cookies are used to save your preferences over multiple sessions, for example personalization of settings on our websites. Cookies may be used to display targeted ads and recommendations, for example to eliminate showing the same ads to you multiple times or showing ads that we think are of interest to you based on your past actions on our website. Cookies are also used to determine the effectiveness of our promotions and advertising campaigns and to improve our products and services.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Nokia may use web beacons (or “pixel tags”) in connection with some of our websites. However, we do not use them to identify individual users personally. Web beacons are typically graphic images that are placed on a website and they are used to count visitors to a website and/or to access certain cookies. This information is used to improve our services. Web beacons do not typically collect any other information than what your browser provides us with as a standard part of any internet communication. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will no longer be able to track your specific activity. The web beacon may, however, continue to collect information about visits from your IP-address.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Some Nokia websites or applications may utilize so called locally stored objects, such as Flash local shared objects ("Flash cookies") or HTML5 Web Storage. Locally stored objects are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. For example, in Flash you can use the Flash Player Settings Manager to control the storage of local shared objects, including disabling the local shared objects for certain websites only or disabling the storage of local shared objects completely for all websites.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Some Nokia websites use third party advertizing technologies, such as DoubleClick, to serve ads.</span> <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx"><span xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></a><span xml:lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank">DoubleClick uses a cookie</a></span> <span xml:lang="EN-US">to collect information about your visits to Nokia and third party websites. This information will be used to serve ads on Nokia and third party websites. The collected information will not be directly personally identifiable nor will DoubleClick share the information with third parties. You may choose to disable the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using</span> <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank"><span xml:lang="EN-US">DoubleClick opt-out cookie.</span></a> <span xml:lang="EN-US">You may also go to</span> <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"><span xml:lang="EN-US">http://networkadvertising.org/</span></a> <span xml:lang="EN-US">to install an opt-out cookie.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Most browsers allow you to disable or allow the use of cookies. You may also delete the cookies on your computer if your browser so permits. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain parts of our services and you may need to re-install the opt-out cookie.</span></p><h2 class="nk-headline-2"><span xml:lang="EN-US">What Are</span> <span xml:lang="EN-US">Your Rights?</span></h2><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">You have a right to know what personal data we hold about you. You have a right to have incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated personal data deleted or updated. You have a right to unsubscribe from marketing messages and to request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing or market research purposes. However, if you opt-out from marketing and other communications from Nokia, we may still send you critical alerts pertaining to our products and services or contact you for these purposes.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">You may exercise your rights by contacting us through the contact points referred to below.

Please also note that applicable law may contain restrictions and other provisions that relate to your rights.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">We encourage you to use available profile management tools, for example Nokia Account for the above purposes as such tools often provide you with direct access to your personal data and allow you to effectively manage it.</span></p><h2 class="nk-headline-2">Who Is The Controller of Your Personal Data?</h2><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Nokia Corporation of Keilalahdentie 4, 02150 Espoo, Finland is the controller of your personal data.</span></p><p class="00BodyText"><span xml:lang="EN-US">In addition, the Nokia affiliate providing the product or service may be a controller of your personal data.
