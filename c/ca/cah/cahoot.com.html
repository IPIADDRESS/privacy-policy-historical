            <h2>data protection statement </h2>
            <p class="tightParagraph">In this statement, 'cahoot' means <b>cahoot</b>, a division of Abbey National plc. This statement relates to the information you give in the online application form and to any other information which you provide to cahoot or which it holds on you whether or not you become a customer.</p>
            <p><b>If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information to offer you alternative products and may make an additional search against a credit reference agency. By continuing with your application you are agreeing that we can pass all your information to Loans.co.uk.</b></p>
            <h2>credit assessment</h2>
            <p class="tightParagraph">
					<strong>cahoot</strong> may use your information for the purposes of determining whether you are eligible to open a cahoot
					account or to provide or increase any credit and, in particular, to carry out a credit assessment, which may include credit scoring, except for
					savings or savings and investment applications. <strong>cahoot</strong> may search the files of credit reference agencies
					which will keep a record of each search and make any other enquiries relating to you that it considers
					necessary (e.g. from another financial institution). Details about you and the conduct of your <strong>cahoot
					account</strong> will also be passed to credit reference agencies. An association between joint applicants or
					between yourself and any named partner/spouse will be created at the credit reference agency. This will
					link your financial records, each of which will be taken into account in all future applications by either
					or both of you. If an association already exists then your application will be assessed with reference to
					these associated records. This situation will continue until one of you successfully files a disassociation
					at the credit reference agency.
	</p>
					<p>
					Before opening your account, cahoot will check your details with fraud prevention agencies and may make
					searches at credit reference agencies who will supply cahoot with information, including information from
					the electoral register for the purpose of verifying your identity. Scoring methods may be used to verify
					your identity. The credit reference agencies will record details of the search whether or not the
					application proceeds but please note that this is not a credit check and will not be seen or used by
					lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. If you give false or inaccurate information and fraud
					is suspected, cahoot will record this.
					</p>

					<p>
					<strong>cahoot</strong> and other organisations may use and search these records to help make decisions about credit and
					credit related services and insurance including motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals
					and claims for you and members of your household; trace debtors, recover debt, prevent money laundering and
					fraud, manage accounts and for statistical purposes.
					</p>

					<p>
					For further information on the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies that we use,
					please telephone 0845 602 0319.
					</p>

					<p>
					If your application is unsuccessful and you wish to discuss your application further, you can contact <strong>cahoot</strong>
					via <a href="../contact_us/contact_us.html">contact us</a>.
			</p>
            <h2>information sharing</h2>
            <p class="tightParagraph">
					You agree that cahoot may use your information to open and manage your <strong>cahoot account</strong> and to improve the products
					and services it offers to you and other customers. You confirm that you are entitled to disclose information about
					any joint applicant or partner/spouse named in the application.
	</p>
			        <p>
					<strong>cahoot</strong> may give essential information about your account(s) and card(s) to others including other companies in the
					Abbey National Group, associated companies and business partners where this is necessary for the operation of the
					account and to people acting as its agents, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential
					and secure. If you have cards on this account, transaction details may be given to any payment system under which
					cahoot issues cards, e.g. Visa, who may transfer the information overseas to process the transactions, for
					resolution of disputes and for statistical purposes. The information may also be disclosed to regulatory bodies and
					other organisations so they can check our compliance with regulatory requirements and voluntary codes of practice.
					<strong>If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information
					to offer you alternative products.</strong> cahoot may send your personal data to Abbey National Group companies, associated
					companies or business partners, including to countries outside the European Economic Area, on the understanding
					that they will keep the information confidential and secure.
