           <!--  <h2>credit assessment</h2>
            <p class="tightParagraph">
					cahoot may use your information to decide whether you are eligible to open a <strong> cahoot </strong>
account, and any future increase in your credit or overdraft limit (if this is available on the
account).
 </p>
<p>
The following does not apply to savings or savings and investment applications: <strong> cahoot </strong> may
carry out a credit assessment, which may include credit scoring. <strong> cahoot </strong> may make any
enquiries relating to you that it considers necessary (e.g. from another financial institution)
and search the files of credit reference agencies which will keep a record of each search. This
could affect your ability to get credit elsewhere within a short period of time. Details about
your application (whether or not it goes ahead) will be recorded at the credit reference
agencies. A financial link between joint applicants or between yourself and any named
partner/spouse will be created at the credit reference agency. This will link your financial
records, each of which will be taken into account in all future applications by either or both of
you. If an association already exists then your application will be assessed with reference to
these associated records. This situation will continue until one of you successfully files a
disassociation at the credit reference agency. <strong> cahoot </strong> will also pass details about you and
how you run your account to the credit reference agencies. This may include if you have
failed to make agreed payments into your account (even if you stay within your agreed
overdraft limit). This information may affect your ability to get credit
</p>

<p>
For all applications: Before opening your account, <strong> cahoot </strong> will check your details with fraud
prevention agencies and may make searches at credit reference agencies who will supply
<strong> cahoot </strong> with information, including information from the electoral register for the purpose of
verifying your identity. Scoring methods may be used to verify your identity. A record of this
process will be kept at the credit reference agencies and may be used to help other
companies to verify your identity. If you give false or inaccurate information and fraud is
identified, <strong> cahoot </strong> will send details to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies
may access and use this information.
</p>

<p>
<strong> cahoot </strong> and other organisations may use and search the records held by credit reference and
fraud prevention agencies about you and your financial associates or partner/spouse and
others in your household, to prevent crime, fraud and money laundering, and for example:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> to check details provided on applications for credit and credit related or other
facilities </li>
	<li>to verify your identity if you or your financial associate applies for other facilities</li>
	<li> to help make decisions about credit and credit related services, insurance proposals
and claims, and all types of facilities for you, your financial associate or
partner/spouse and other members of your household</li>
	<li> to check the operation of credit and credit related accounts and to manage accounts
and facilities, including tracing debtors and recovering debt</li>
	<li> to help make decisions about job applicants and employees</li>
	<li> to undertake statistical analysis and system testing</li>
cahoot and other organisations may search and use from other countries the information</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong> cahoot </strong> and other organisations may search and use from other countries the information
recorded at fraud prevention agencies. For further information on the credit reference
agencies and fraud prevention agencies that we use, please telephone 0845 602 0319.
</p>

<p>
If your application is unsuccessful and you wish to discuss your application further, you can
contact cahoot via the ‘contact us’ section of the cahoot website.
</p>

<h2>information sharing</h2>
<p class="tightParagraph">
You agree that <strong>cahoot</strong> may use your information to open and manage your cahoot account
and to improve the products and services it offers to you and other customers. You confirm
that you are entitled to disclose information about any joint applicant or partner/spouse named
in the application.</p>

<p>
<strong>cahoot</strong> may use and share all the information you give to <strong>cahoot</strong> or <strong>cahoot</strong> holds on you,
with the group of companies to which cahoot belongs (the Santander Group), associated
companies, service providers or agents who may be based in other countries. This includes
information about the conduct (including details of transactions) of any account that you have
with us, a group company or an associated company. cahoot will make sure that your
information is only used in line with its instructions and strict policies on confidentiality. If
cahoot transfers your information to another country, <strong>cahoot</strong> will make sure that it is given the
same levels of protection as needed under the UK Data Protection Act. <strong>cahoot</strong> may pass
information to business partners where this is necessary for the operation of the account on
the understanding that they will keep the information confidential and secure. cahoot may
also give essential information about your account and cards (if any) to others if needed to
run your account or for regulatory purposes. If you have cards on this account, information on
transactions you have made using your cards may be given to any payment system under
which <strong>cahoot</strong> issues cards (for example Visa or MasterCard), who may transfer the
information overseas to deal with the transactions, to resolve disputes and for statistical
purposes.
</p>
<h2>cahoot marketing</h2>
<p class="tightParagraph">
<strong> cahoot does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to others. </strong></p>

<p>
Your information may be shared with other companies in the Santander Group, associated
companies or business partners to advise you, by post, telephone or other electronic media
(including email and SMS), of any <strong>cahoot</strong>-approved products and services that may be of
interest to you. When deciding whether to provide you with details of credit products cahoot
may search the files of a credit reference agency, who will not make a record of this search
available to others who search your file.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, cahoot may ask you to take part in its customer research, via email or
telephone. In particular, cahoot may use your information, including any information about
your transactions, to inform you about any products or services in which you may be
interested.
</p>

<p>
You understand that you will be given the opportunity to tell us later in the application process
if you would prefer not to receive such information or to take part in our customer research.
</p>

<h2>Accessing and Updating your Information</h2>
<p class="tightParagraph">
<strong> cahoot will keep information about you after your account is closed. </strong></p>

<p>
You may request a copy of the information which we have about you at any time by writing to
us at cahoot, 3rd Floor Friars House, Manor House Drive, Coventry, CV1 2TE. A fee of £10
will apply. You may inform us at any time that your personal details have changed by filling
out the appropriate pages on the change personal details section of the cahoot website. We
will change your personal details in accordance with your instructions.
