            <h2>data protection statement </h2>
            <p>In this statement, 'cahoot' means <b>cahoot</b>, a division of Abbey National plc. This statement relates to the information you give in the online application form and to any other information which you provide to cahoot or which it holds on you whether or not you become a customer.</p>
            <p><b>If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information to offer you alternative products and may make an additional search against a credit reference agency. By continuing with your application you are agreeing that we can pass all your information to Loans.co.uk.</b></p>
            <h2>credit assessment</h2>
            <p>cahoot may use your information for the purposes of determining whether you are eligible to open a cahoot account and, in particular, to carry out a credit assessment, which may include credit scoring, except for savings or savings and investment applications. cahoot may search the files of credit reference agencies which will keep a record of each search and make any other enquiries relating to you that it considers necessary (e.g. from another financial institution). Details about you and the conduct of your cahoot account will also be passed to credit reference agencies. cahoot will check your details with CIFAS (Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance Scheme) and National Hunter and, if the information you provide is false or inaccurate and fraud is suspected, cahoot will record this. An association between joint applicants or between yourself and any named partner/spouse will be created at the credit reference agency. This will link your financial records, each of which will be taken into account in all future applications by either or both of you. If an association already exists then your application will be assessed with reference to these associated records. This situation will continue until one of you successfully files a disassociation at the credit reference agency. </p>
            <p>cahoot and other organisations may use and search these records to help make decisions about credit and credit related services and insurance including motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and claims for you and members of your household; trace debtors, recover debt, prevent money laundering and fraud and for statistical purposes.</p>
            <p>If your application is unsuccessful and you wish to discuss your application further, you can contact cahoot via <a href="../contact_us/contact_us.html">contact us</a>.</p>
            <h2>information sharing</h2>
            <p>You agree that cahoot may use your information to open and manage your cahoot account and to improve the products and services it offers to you and other customers. You confirm that you are entitled to disclose information about any joint applicant or partner/spouse named in the application.</p>
            <p>cahoot may give essential information about your account(s) and card(s) to others including other companies in the Abbey National Group, associated companies and business partners where this is necessary for the operation of the account and to people acting as its agents, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential and secure. <b>If your application is unsuccessful cahoot may pass your information to Loans.co.uk who may use this information to offer you alternative products</b>. cahoot may send your personal data to Abbey National Group companies, associated companies or business partners, including to countries outside the European Economic Area, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential and secure. </p>
