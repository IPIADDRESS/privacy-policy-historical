		<p>This website, along with most other major websites, uses cookies. Cookies let users navigate around websites and (where appropriate) 
		let us tailor the content to fit the needs of visitors who have accessed the site and help us improve the user experience. Without cookies 
		enabled we can't guarantee that the website and your experience whilst visiting are as we intended it to be. <strong>None of the cookies used on our 
		websites collect personally identifiable information about you.</strong>

		<h2>at cahoot we use cookies in the following ways:</h2>

		<li>We use cookies within our online application forms. Without cookies enabled you will not be able to apply for our products.
		</li><br>
		<li>To track how visitors reach our site and the path they take through it to help us improve our service to you. For example, we use Google 
		Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us to analyse how users use the site. Find
