<p><strong>I. INTRODUCTION<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and all of our subsidiaries, affiliates, casinos and resorts (collectively, "Caesars Entertainment") have an unwavering commitment to providing outstanding products and services to visitors to our web sites. This Privacy Policy explains our practices for the following sites: Bally's Las Vegas, Paris Las Vegas, Flamingo Las Vegas, Caesars Palace,&nbsp;Reno Hilton, Caesars Tahoe, Flamingo Laughlin, Bally's New Orleans, Grand Casino Gulfport, Grand Casino Biloxi, Grand Casino Tunica, Bally's Tunica, Sheraton Tunica, Caesars Indiana, Bally's Atlantic City, Caesars Atlantic City, Atlantic City Hilton, Claridge Casino Hotel, and Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (collectively, the "Sites").<br><br>Caesars Entertainment owns, manages or has an interest in 28 gaming properties operating under the Bally's, Caesars, Paris, Flamingo, Grand and Hilton brand names in the United States with a total of approximately 2 million square feet of gaming space, 29,000 hotel rooms and approximately 55,000 employees worldwide. Caesars Entertainment also manages other gaming properties outside the United States<br><br><strong>II. THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS LIMITED TO INFORMATION COLLECTED ON CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT SITES<br></strong>This Privacy Policy only applies to information Caesars Entertainment collects online through the Sites. Please note that, while reference may be made to information collected offline, this Privacy Policy is not a comprehensive statement of how information collected offline is obtained or used.<br><br>In addition, you hereby acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is incorporated in the Terms and Conditions of Use that controls your use and access of the Sites. A link to the Terms and Conditions can be found in the footer of any Caesars Entertainment's sites.<br><br><strong>III. WHY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT COLLECTS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment collects information in a variety of different manners for multiple purposes, including: (1) to help us continually improve the services we offer, (2) to improve the utility of the Sites, and (3) to provide you and other interested visitors with information about promotions and other materials through e-mail and other communications that we believe will be beneficial to you. We will not share, sell or transfer personally identifiable information about you to third parties to use for their own marketing efforts except as outlined below or with your approval.<br><br><strong>IV. HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED BY CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT<br><br>A. NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br></strong>On a regular basis, the Sites collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Some examples of such information may include the type of browser you are using, what sites you came from, what pages of the Sites you visit, how much time is spent on those pages, and the pages from which you exit the Sites. In addition, Caesars Entertainment collects some non-personally identifiable information in the manners described below:<br><br><strong>1. COOKIES<br></strong>In general, when you visit the Sites, you remain anonymous unless you choose to provide information to us. The Sites do use "cookies," i.e., very small text files sent to your computer, which temporarily reside in your computer's hard drive. These cookies enable Caesars Entertainment to help your computer navigate through the Sites more quickly and allow us to better understand how visitors use the Sites. <strong>Caesars Entertainment does not use cookies to track what you do when you are not on the Sites or to collect personally identifiable information about you. These cookies do not damage or corrupt your computer or computer files.<br><br></strong>If you do not wish to receive the benefits of these cookies, you may set your browser to reject them. You should consult the instructions of your particular browser on how to do this. However, please be aware that rejecting the cookies could affect your ability to perform certain transactions on the Sites.<br><br><strong>2. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment uses a third-party advertising company, Avenue A, to serve ads about Caesars Entertainment to other sites on the Internet; these ads contain links to a Site. Avenue A employs technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of such ads and that allows it to identify visitors to the Sites who viewed a particular ad on another site. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as an action tag, which Avenue A places on the Sites as well as the other sites where it places ads to collect anonymous information. Avenue A may use information about your visits to our Sites and other sites on the Internet in order to personalize the advertisements you may see on other sites to offer you goods and services that Avenue A believes may be of interest to you. Unless otherwise notified, Avenue A does not use names, addresses, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers to identify visitors, and does not link online actions to an identifiable person.<br><br>Of course, while Avenue A provides some of this non-identifiable information to Caesars Entertainment, Caesars Entertainment does not control how Avenue A collects or uses this information. Our explanation here is based on the information provided to us by Avenue A. If you would like more information about this practice as well as your choices about not having this information collected or used by Avenue A and/or its customers, <a href="http://www.avenueainc.com/privacy/" target="_blank">click here</a>. <br><br><strong>3. E-MAIL DISCLOSURE<br></strong>Your personal information may be shared with reputable third parties but only for use in campaign delivery or to provide more relevant advertising. Your personal information may be combined with additional information provided by you at registration or augmented from other data sources in order to provide more relevant campaigns to you. We will never rent your personal information without your consent.<br><br><em>Caesars Entertainment uses a third-party e-mail service provider, CheetahMail, to deploy e-mail offers/correspondence from the "Sites"; these e-mails contain links to a Site. The personal information you have provided us will be used to help make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. If at any time you wish to discontinue receiving any e-mail sent by our marketing partners, or us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the e-mail. The e-mail offers and e-mail newsletters, as well as any campaigns contained in those e-mails sent to you by this site or our marketing partners, are provided through&nbsp;CheetahMail's E-mail Service.</em> <br><br><strong>B. PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br>Caesars Entertainment does not collect personal information from visitors to the Sites in any non-obvious manner.</strong> In order to provide you with more effective and personalized service, Caesars Entertainment does, however, collect personal information such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit card information, and other information in a variety of manners, as described below:<br><br><strong>1. RESERVATION PROCESS<br></strong>Visitors to the Sites have the ability to search for rates and availability at any of our hotels and resorts in the United States without ever providing any personal information. However, once you have decided on an available reservation, you will be asked to provide personal information. This will include your name, address, and other contact information, as well a credit card number, billing address, and the card's expiration date. The credit card number will be used solely to secure your reservation as detailed in the reservation process. Caesars Entertainment will create a private account for you based on the information you have provided as part of the reservation process; this account will enable you to access and/or modify your travel plans online and is designed to make your experience with the Sites both more personal and efficient. [To link to your Personal Profile - Guest Services Page, you must log into the E-mail Offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site.] Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources. Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you. Click here for more detailed information about how Caesars Entertainment uses this information.<br><br>Caesars Entertainment takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Reservations page on each Site is secure. For more information about our secure certificates, please click on the gold "Verisign" seal located on each Reservations page. For more information about our current security methods, please see the Security section below.<br><br>Your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence; we may authorize payment(s) at this time that is consistent with payment process for each site. Once your reservation is confirmed, the Caesars Entertainment resort you have chosen will receive all the information you have submitted. The transfer of information takes place in the same fashion as if you called directly or made your reservation through a travel agent. Shortly after, you will receive an e-mail confirmation. That information is then used to create a user log in for you on our Site database.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>2.

Unless you indicate at the time that you provide this information that it may only be used for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will place this information into its database that may contain information we have collected about you via the Sites as well as offline and use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>5. PURCHASE INFORMATION<br></strong>When you purchase an item through our Sites such as at our online store, we will ask for your name, the type of credit card you intend to use, your credit card number, your billing address for the card, and the card's expiration date. This information is necessary in order for us to bill you for your purchase. If your billing address differs from your shipping address, or if you intend to send your purchase to a third party, we will ask you for additional name and address information in order to fulfill your request. As described above, Caesars Entertainment will create a private account for you based on the information you have provided; this account is designed to make your future visits to the Sites even more personal and efficient.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will also combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline resources.</strong> Unless you indicate at this time that Caesars Entertainment may only use this information for limited purposes, Caesars Entertainment will use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment without your express written consent, except as provided below.</strong> [See Special Promotions and Contests; Special Circumstances; and How Caesars Entertainment Uses Personal Information]<br><br><strong>6.

HOW CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT USES PERSONAL INFORMATION<br><br>A. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT SHARES THIS INFORMATION WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES<br></strong>Unless you have specifically limited how Caesars Entertainment may use your personally identifiable information, Caesars Entertainment will place that information into its database that may contain information we have collected about you via the Sites as well as offline and use it to send you future e-mails and correspondence about promotions, special events and/or other items we believe may be of interest to you. The information in this database is available to designated persons at Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries and affiliates including those that operate any of the Caesars Entertainment hotel and resorts.<br><br><strong>Caesars Entertainment treats the information you provide as confidential information and takes reasonable measures to ensure that it is only available to designated personnel for use in connection with Caesars Entertainment's business.</strong> Caesars Entertainment may use third parties to assist it with fulfilling your requests, completing your reservation, forwarding you material, or similar functions. These third parties are under a contractual obligation to not use this information except for these limited purposes. Except for these exceptions, or in the event that Caesars Entertainment sells an entire line of business relating to a particular web site, or in the event of a "special circumstance," [See Sale of Assets and Special Circumstances] Caesars Entertainment will not sell, share or transfer your personal information to any entity outside of the Caesars Entertainment family of companies.<br><br><strong>B. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MAY COMBINE ONLINE INFORMATION WITH OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT VISITORS TO ITS SITES<br></strong>In addition to the above, Caesars Entertainment will combine the personal information it collects online with information it collects through offline methods, including but not limited to surveys, guest comments, and market research. You may opt out of receiving e-mail correspondence by logging into the E-mail Offers sign in on any Caesars Entertainment site. <br><br><strong>C. OPT-OUT CHOICES<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment provides you with the ability to control how we use your personally identifiable information.

In addition, third party web sites that are accessed through links on the Sites have separate privacy policies and security measures, and Caesars Entertainment is not responsible or liable for the practices, policies or security measures implemented on these third party web sites.<br><br><strong>You hereby acknowledge that Caesars Entertainment is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner</strong>.<br><br><strong>VIII.

Caesars Entertainment is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, and you are encouraged to view the privacy policies of these other sites as soon as you enter them.<br><br><strong>IX. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES<br></strong>Caesars Entertainment reserves the right to disclose the personal information of the users of the Sites for any law enforcement purpose at the request of any law enforcement body or in response to a subpoena or as otherwise required by any court or administrative agency. We may also share such information at our discretion if it appears that your actions on the Sites are in violation of the Terms and Conditions of Use, and that disclosure of this information will assist in efforts to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use or will assist Caesars Entertainment in connection with any legal proceeding between you and Caesars Entertainment. A link to the Terms and Conditions can be found in the footer of any Caesars Entertainment's sites. Caesars Entertainment may also provide email addresses to third parties for suppression purposes.
