			<p class="OrangeTitle">I. Introduction</p>
			<br>
			Park Place Entertainment Corporation and all of our subsidiaries, affiliates, 
			casinos and resorts (collectively, "PPE") have an unwavering commitment to 
			providing outstanding products and services to visitors to our web sites. This 
			Privacy Policy explains our practices for the following sites: Bally's Las 
			Vegas, Paris Las Vegas, Flamingo Las Vegas, Caesars Palace, Las Vegas Hilton, 
			Reno Hilton, Caesars Tahoe, Flamingo Laughlin, Bally's New Orleans, Grand 
			Casino Gulfport, Grand Casino Biloxi, Grand Casino Tunica, Bally's Tunica, 
			Sheraton Tunica, Caesars Indiana, Bally's Atlantic City, Caesars Atlantic City, 
			Atlantic City Hilton, Claridge Casino Hotel, and Park Place Entertainment 
			Corporation (collectively, the "Sites").
			<br>
			<br>
			PPE owns, manages or has an interest in 28 gaming properties operating under 
			the Bally's, Caesars, Paris, Flamingo, Grand and Hilton brand names in the 
			United States with a total of approximately 2 million square feet of gaming 
			space, 29,000 hotel rooms and approximately 55,000 employees worldwide. PPE 
			also manages other gaming properties outside the United States.
			<p class="OrangeTitle">
				II. This Privacy Policy Is Limited to Information Collected on PPE Sites</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			This Privacy Policy only applies to information PPE collects online through the 
			Sites. Please note that, while reference may be made to information collected 
			offline, this Privacy Policy is not a comprehensive statement of how 
			information collected offline is obtained or used.<br>
			<br>
			In addition, you hereby acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is incorporated in 
			the Terms and Conditions of Use that controls your use and access of the Sites. 
			A link to the Terms and Conditions can be found in the footer of any PPE's 
			sites.
			<p class="OrangeTitle">III. Why PPE Collects Personally Identifiable Information</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			PPE collects information in a variety of different manners for multiple 
			purposes, including: (1) to help us continually improve the services we offer, 
			(2) to improve the utility of the Sites, and (3) to provide you and other 
			interested visitors with information about promotions and other materials 
			through e-mail and other communications that we believe will be beneficial to 
			you. We will not share, sell or transfer personally identifiable information 
			about you to third parties to use for their own marketing efforts except as 
			outlined below or with your approval.
			<p class="OrangeTitle">IV. How Information Is Collected By PPE</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="OrangeTitle">A. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			On a regular basis, the Sites collect information about you that is not 
			personally identifiable. Some examples of such information may include the type 
			of browser you are using, what sites you came from, what pages of the Sites you 
			visit, how much time is spent on those pages, and the pages from which you exit 
			the Sites. In addition, PPE collects some non-personally identifiable 
			information in the manners described below:
			<p class="OrangeTitle">1. Cookies</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			In general, when you visit the Sites, you remain anonymous unless you choose to 
			provide information to us. The Sites do use "cookies," i.e., very small text 
			files sent to your computer, which temporarily reside in your computer's hard 
			drive. These cookies enable PPE to help your computer navigate through the 
			Sites more quickly and allow us to better understand how visitors use the 
			Sites. <b>PPE does not use cookies to track what you do when you are not on the 
				Sites or to collect personally identifiable information about you. These 
				cookies do not damage or corrupt your computer or computer files.</b><br>
			<br>
			If you do not wish to receive the benefits of these cookies, you may set your 
			browser to reject them. You should consult the instructions of your particular 
			browser on how to do this. However, please be aware that rejecting the cookies 
			could affect your ability to perform certain transactions on the Sites.
			<p class="OrangeTitle">2. Third Party Advertising</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			PPE uses a third-party advertising company, Avenue A, to serve ads about PPE to 
			other sites on the Internet; these ads contain links to a Site. Avenue A 
			employs technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of such ads and 
			that allows it to identify visitors to the Sites who viewed a particular ad on 
			another site. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology 
			device, commonly referred to as an action tag, which Avenue A places on the 
			Sites as well as the other sites where it places ads to collect anonymous 
			information. Avenue A may use information about your visits to our Sites and 
			other sites on the Internet in order to personalize the advertisements you may 
			see on other sites to offer you goods and services that Avenue A believes may 
			be of interest to you. Unless otherwise notified, Avenue A does not use names, 
			addresses, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers to identify visitors, and does 
			not link online actions to an identifiable person.<br>
			<br>
			Of course, while Avenue A provides some of this non-identifiable information to 
			PPE, PPE does not control how Avenue A collects or uses this information. Our 
			explanation here is based on the information provided to us by Avenue A. If you 
			would like more information about this practice as well as your choices about 
			not having this information collected or used by Avenue A and/or its customers, <a href="http://www.avenueainc.com/privacy/">
				click here</a>.
			<p class="OrangeTitle">3. Email Disclosure</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			Your personal information may be shared with reputable 3rd parties but only for 
			use in campaign delivery or to provide more relevant advertising. Your personal 
			information may be combined with additional information provided by you at 
			registration or augmented from other data sources in order to provide more 
			relevant Campaigns to you. We will never rent your personal information without 
			your consent.<br>
			<br>
			<i>PPE uses a third-party email service provider, Zustek, to deploy email offers/correspondence from the "Sites"; these emails contain links to a Site. The personal information you have provided us will be used to help make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. If at any time you wish to discontinue receiving any email sent by our marketing partners, or us simply follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. The email offers and email newsletters as well as any campaigns contained in those emails sent to you by this site or our marketing partners are provided through Zustek's Email Service.
			</i>
			<p class="OrangeTitle">B. Personally Identifiable Information</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>PPE does not collect personal information from visitors to the Sites in any 
				non-obvious manner.</b> In order to provide you with more effective and 
			personalized service, PPE does, however, collect personal information such as 
			names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit card information, and other 
			information in a variety of manners, as described below:
			<p class="OrangeTitle">1. Reservation Process</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			Visitors to the Sites have the ability to search for rates and availability at 
			any of our hotels and resorts in the United States without ever providing any 
			personal information. However, once you have decided on an available 
			reservation, you will be asked to provide personal information. This will 
			include your name, address, and other contact information, as well a credit 
			card number, billing address, and the card's expiration date. The credit card 
			number will be used solely to secure your reservation as detailed in the 
			reservation process. PPE will create a private account for you based on the 
			information you have provided as part of the reservation process; this account 
			will enable you to access and/or modify your travel plans online and is 
			designed to make your experience with the Sites both more personal and 
			efficient. [To link to your Personal Profile - Guest Services Page, you must 
			log into the Email Offers sign in on any PPE site.] PPE will also combine this 
			information with any other data we have collected about you using our offline 
			resources. Unless you indicate at this time that PPE may only use this 
			information for limited purposes, PPE will use it for future reference when, 
			e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or 
			resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you. Click here 
			for more detailed information about how PPE uses this information.<br>
			<br>
			PPE takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Reservations page on each Site is 
			secure. For more information about our secure certificates, please click on the 
			gold "Verisign" seal located on each Reservations page. For more information 
			about our current security methods, please see the Security section below.<br>
			<br>
			Your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence; we may 
			authorize payments at this time that is consistent with payment process for 
			each site. Once your reservation is confirmed, the PPE resort you have chosen 
			will receive all the information you have submitted. The transfer of 
			information takes place in the same fashion as if you called directly or made 
			your reservation through a travel agent. Shortly after, you will receive an 
			e-mail confirmation. That information is then used to create a user log in for 
			you on our Site database.<br>
			<br>
			<b>PPE will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not 
				affiliated with PPE without your express written consent, except as provided 
				below.</b> [See <a class="Text" href="#specialpromotion">Special Promotions and 
				Contests</a>; <a href="#specialcircumstances" class="Text">Special 
				Circumstances</a>; and <a class="Text" href="#howppe">How PPE Uses Personal

			<p class="OrangeTitle">2. Park Place Connection</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			Every visitor is invited to sign up for the Park Place Connection program, 
			which is your link to cash back, complimentary meals and other exciting special 
			offers for PPE's properties throughout the United States. In order to sign up 
			for this service, you will be asked to provide personal information including 
			your name, address, and other contact information. This may only be available 
			in certain regions/properties owned by Park Place Entertainment. <b>PPE will also 
				combine this information with any other data we have collected about you using 
				our offline resources.</b> Unless you indicate at this time that PPE may 
			only use this information for limited purposes, PPE use it for future reference 
			when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or 
			resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to you.<br>

				Circumstances</a>; and <a class="Text" href="#howppe">How PPE Uses Personal 
				Information</a>]
			<p class="OrangeTitle">3. Personal Profile - Guest Services Page</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			PPE will create a private account for you based on the information you have 
			provided as part of the reservation or purchase process or when you sign up for 
			a Park Place Connection Card; this account will enable you to access and/or 
			modify your travel plans online and is designed to make your experience with 
			the Sites both more personal and efficient. Alternatively, you may also create 
			this profile without making a reservation or purchase by simply signing up for 
			Email Offers through the Sites, which will create a guest services account. In 
			order to sign up for this service, you will be requested to provide information 
			such as your name, address, other contact information, and whether you wish to 
			receive future e-mail communications from PPE.<br>
			<br>
			<b>PPE will also combine this information with any other data we have collected 
				about you using our offline resources.</b> Unless you indicate at this time 
			that PPE may only use this information for limited purposes, PPE will use it 
			for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at 
			one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest 
			to you.<br>

			update any of the information you provide for your profile at any time, by 
			logging into the email offers sign in on any PPE site. <a name="specialpromotion"></a>
				<p class="OrangeTitle">
					4. Special Promotions and Contests</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				Occasionally, PPE requests visitors of the Sites to provide their e-mail 
				address in order to provide them with information about, for example, 
				promotions and special offers, or to participate in a contest or sweepstakes. 
				PPE will also combine this information with any other data we have collected 
				about you using our offline resources. Unless you indicate at this time that 
				PPE may only use this information for limited purposes, PPE will use it for 
				future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at one 
				of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest to 
				you. Unless you indicate at the time that you provide this information that it 
				may only be used for limited purposes, PPE will place this information into its 
				database that may contain information we have collected about you via the Sites 
				as well as offline and use it for future reference when, e.g., we provide you 
				with offers for future stays at one of our hotels or resorts or other 
				information we believe may be of interest to you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PPE will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not 
					affiliated with PPE without your express written consent, except as provided 
					below.</b> [See <a class="Text" href="#specialpromotion">Special Promotions and 
					Contests</a>; <a href="#specialcircumstances" class="Text">Special 
					Circumstances</a>; and <a class="Text" href="#howppe">How PPE Uses Personal 
					Information</a>]
				<p class="OrangeTitle">5. Purchase Information</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				When you purchase an item through our Sites such as at our online store, we 
				will ask for your name, the type of credit card you intend to use, your credit 
				card number, your billing address for the card, and the card's expiration date. 
				This information is necessary in order for us to bill you for your purchase. If 
				your billing address differs from your shipping address, or if you intend to 
				send your purchase to a third party, we will ask you for additional name and 
				address information in order to fulfill your request. As described above, PPE 
				will create a private account for you based on the information you have 
				provided; this account is designed to make your future visits to the Sites even 
				more personal and efficient.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PPE will also combine this information with any other data we have collected 
					about you using our offline resources.</b> Unless you indicate at this time 
				that PPE may only use this information for limited purposes, PPE will use it 
				for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at 
				one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest 
				to you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PPE will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not

					Contests</a>; <a href="#specialcircumstances" class="Text">Special 
					Circumstances</a>; and <a class="Text" href="#howppe">How PPE Uses Personal 
					Information</a>]
				<p class="OrangeTitle">6. Other Online Sources</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				PPE may also collect personally identifiable information about you from other 
				online sources including, without limitation, e-mail inquiries sent by you to 
				PPE, your response to special offers and promotions periodically offered 
				through the Sites, and information you provide through other special features 
				appearing on the Sites currently or in the future. PPE will use the information 
				you provide to process your request and/or research your query. In addition, 
				PPE may also use the information you provide in the manners described herein.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PPE will also combine this information with any other data we have collected 
					about you using our offline resources.</b> Unless you indicate at this time 
				that PPE may only use this information for limited purposes, PPE will use it 
				for future reference when, e.g., we provide you with offers for future stays at 
				one of our hotels or resorts or other information we believe may be of interest 
				to you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PPE will never share any of your personally identifiable data with any party not 
					affiliated with PPE without your express written consent, except as provided 
					below.</b> [See <a class="Text" href="#specialpromotion">Special Promotions and 
					Contests</a>; <a href="#specialcircumstances" class="Text">Special 
					Circumstances</a>; and <a class="Text" href="#howppe">How PPE Uses Personal 
					Information</a>] 
					<a name="howppe"></a><p class="OrangeTitle">V. How PPE Uses Personal Information</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p class="OrangeTitle">A. PPE Shares this Information with its Subsidiaries and 
						Affiliates</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					Unless you have specifically limited how PPE may use your personally 
					identifiable information, PPE will place that information into its database 
					that may contain information we have collected about you via the Sites as well 
					as offline and use it to send you future e-mails and correspondence about 
					promotions, special events and/or other items we believe may be of interest to 
					you. The information in this database is available to designated persons at PPE 
					and its subsidiaries and affiliates including those that operate any of the PPE 
					hotel and resorts.<br>
					<br>
					<b>PPE treats the information you provide as confidential information and takes 
						reasonable measures to ensure that it is only available to designated personnel 
						for use in connection with PPE's business.</b> PPE may use third parties to 
					assist it with fulfilling your requests, completing your reservation, 
					forwarding you material, or similar functions. These third parties are under a 
					contractual obligation to not use this information except for these limited 
					purposes. Except for these exceptions, or in the event that PPE sells an entire 
					line of business relating to a particular web site, or in the event of a 
					"special circumstance," [See <a href="#sale" class="Text">Sale of Assets</a> and
					<a href="#specialcircumstances" class="Text">Special Circumstances</a>] PPE 
					will not sell, share or transfer your personal information to any entity 
					outside of the PPE family of companies.
					<p class="OrangeTitle">B. PPE May Combine Online Information with Other Information 
						Collected about Visitors to its Sites</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					In addition to the above, PPE will combine the personal information it collects 
					online with information it collects through offline methods, including but not 
					limited to surveys, guest comments, and market research. You may opt out of 
					receiving email correspondence by logging into the Email Offers sign in on any 
					PPE site.
					<p class="OrangeTitle">C. Opt-Out Choices</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					PPE provides you with the ability to control how we use your personally 
					identifiable information. Since PPE does not sell or rent its customers' data 
					to third parties, you need not opt-out in order to avoid receiving e-mails that 
					do not relate to PPE's properties and services. If you do not wish to receive 
					this information, you may elect to limit our use of your information in one of 
					two ways. First, you may elect not to receive communications from PPE about 
					offers or promotions we think may be of interest to you. Second, you may elect 
					not to allow us to combine information collected about you online with our 
					offline database. You may exercise your opt out options at any time by logging 
					into your guest services account through the Email Offers sign in on any PPE 
					site. Please allow up to six weeks for your new preferences to take effect. PPE 
					reserves the right to limit participation in certain sweepstakes, contests, or 
					other promotions to visitors who do not elect to use their opt-out rights.
					<p class="OrangeTitle">VI. Accessing Your Guest Services Profile</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					As noted above, you always have the ability to review and update your personal 
					profile, including the personally identifiable information you provide as well 
					as opt out from receiving email correspondence from PPE properties. Simply log 
					in to your Guest Services account through the Email Offers sign in on any PPE 
					site, click the "Update Profile" link, and make the modifications you desire. <a name="Security"></a>
						<p class="OrangeTitle">VII. Security</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						PPE regularly reviews the security of the Sites. Although the confidentiality 
						of any communication or material transmitted to and from PPE via the Internet 
						or e-mail cannot be absolutely guaranteed, PPE endeavors to create secure and 
						reliable Sites for its visitors. PPE has invested, and will continue to invest, 
						in high quality security in terms of access to information, data quality, and 
						physical security of servers where information is stored. PPE implements a 
						variety of security measures, including encryption and other measures against 
						hacking or unauthorized access to protect confidential information such as 
						credit card numbers, names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and any other personal 
						information you may provide during your visit to the Sites from loss, misuse, 
						interception and hacking. In addition, the information you provide is available 
						only to qualified, designated persons at PPE, including those that operate any 
						of the PPE hotel and resorts, who are under an obligation to maintain the 
						confidentiality of your personal information in a manner consistent with this 
						Privacy Policy.<br>
						<br>
						Nevertheless, when disclosing any personal information, you should remain 
						mindful that, as with all e-mail sent via the Internet, your information may be 
						intercepted without our consent by unscrupulous members of the public and, 
						consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In
