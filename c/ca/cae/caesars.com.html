<p><strong>Information We May Collect</strong></p>
<p>We collect and use information we believe is necessary to administer our business and provide you with the products and services you request. We may collect and maintain both Personal and Non-Personal Information needed for these purposes.</p>

<p><strong>III. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND HOW WE COLLECT SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Identification (“ID”) Verification.</strong> Casinos are required to verify the photo ID at the Casino entrances of all individuals who appear to be under 30, to ensure that no one under the legal gambling age of 19 is permitted entry. Security Officers posted at the entrance of the Casino may use identification verifiers to scan any ID including if they believe it may have been tampered with or altered.</p>
<p>Casinos are also required, under provincial and federal laws, to verify government-issued photo ID and to record certain information, including name, date of birth, address, type of ID, place of issuance of ID, and ID reference number, before conducting certain types of transactions. These transactions include but are not limited to foreign exchange transactions of Cdn.$3,000 or more, cash transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more (see Large Cash Transaction Records), casino disbursement transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more, credit extensions of any amount, and opening a front money account in any amount.</p>
<p>Caesars Windsor also requires government-issued photo ID before issuing or permitting use of a loyalty card for its Loyalty Program such as the Total Rewards Card to protect customers who may lose or misplace their cards.</p>
<p><strong>2. Photography.</strong> To protect your privacy, photography is prohibited on the gaming floor. The only exceptions to this prohibition are photographs of jackpot and tournament winners, who consent in writing to their picture being taken. Except for your spouse or significant other, no other customers will be included in the photographs. Caesars Windsor may also take photographs inside the casino for publicity purposes and advertising campaigns. In these cases, only actors are used in the photographs, and signage is posted to advise customers of the photography shoot. In some cases, entertainers will have their performances in the Entertainment Centre videotaped and photographed. When this is happening, we will notify you through signage and/or an announcement at the beginning of the performance.</p>
<p><strong>3. Video Surveillance.</strong> In order to comply with Regulations made pursuant to the Gaming Control Act, Caesars Windsor is required to have surveillance systems to monitor all gaming and sensitive areas of the Casino. Video surveillance cameras are used to protect Caesars Windsor, its customers and employees against potential violations of criminal and/or civil laws. Surveillance camera output is monitored by Caesars Windsor Surveillance personnel, authorized Caesars Windsor officers or directors, Ontario Provincial Police and regulatory authorities.</p>
<p><strong>4. Self-Exclusion and Facial Recognition.</strong> Self-exclusion is a voluntary program offered by Caesars Windsor and the OLG to individuals who choose to be included in the program because they have difficulty gaming responsibly. In addition to the information collected directly from individuals who have completed the Self-Exclusion Form as described below, the self-exclusion program also uses an automated facial recognition technology system to identify self-excluded individuals. This technology captures facial images of Casino customers at a distance and compares such images to the images of those who have voluntarily provided their photograph to the self-exclusion program. This technology only identifies possible matches with those registered with the self-exclusion program and does not identify or retain the images of other individuals. Access to the information gathered as part of the self-exclusion program, including facial recognition information, is limited to the individuals who require the information in order to operate the self-exclusion program. All information gathered as part of the self-exclusion program, including all facial recognition information, is protected by the appropriate technological systems including encryption algorithms.</p>
<p>The description of the self-exclusion program and facial recognition technology as set out in this Privacy Policy does not amend or supersede the terms and conditions that any individual agreed to when registering for the self-exclusion program and, specifically, does not provide any kind of representation or guarantee with respect to the effectiveness of the self-exclusion program.</p>
<p><strong>5. Involuntary Exclusion.</strong> To protect the safety or security of our customers and employees, and to comply with Caesars Windsor’s commitment to responsible gaming and a safe and secure gaming environment, you may be involuntarily excluded from Caesars Windsor (by Notice of Trespass or otherwise) if we believe that you have difficulty gaming responsibly, if you have been involved in a safety or security incident at Caesars Windsor, another Ontario Casino or another Casino owned, operated or managed by Caesars and its affiliates, or if you have otherwise demonstrated behaviour that we believe puts you, other customers or our employees at risk. We will collect and retain information relating to the circumstances leading to our determination that you should be excluded from the premises.</p>
<p><strong>6. Manual and Electronic Forms.</strong> During your visit to Caesars Windsor, you may be asked to provide information for various forms, requiring different types of Personal Information. The forms you may be asked to complete fall in the following categories:</p>
<p>(a) <u><em>Customer Tracking and Reward Programs.</em></u> From time to time Caesars Windsor has established and may in future establish various player tracking and reward programs. For example, you may choose to become a member of our Loyalty Program so that you can redeem your slot points for cash back, reward credits for cash, or qualify for complimentaries, and many other promotional offers, and receive invitations to parties and events. If you choose to join the Loyalty Program and have your play rated, we may collect certain information about you including name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, interests, gaming history, number of visits to the Casino, and level of play. If you choose to join the Loyalty Program through one of our affiliates, including through a website or mobile application owned, controlled or operated by one of our affiliates, the affiliate may disclose this information to us and we may collect it from them. Caesars Windsor uses this information to better understand the interests of its customers, to provide you with valuable marketing information, and to assess your eligibility for cash back, reward credits for cash, complimentaries, and other promotional offers, and to invite you to parties and events.</p>
<p>(b) <u><em>Credit Applications.</em></u> As a service to eligible customers, Caesars Windsor may extend you credit to facilitate gaming. To assess your eligibility for credit and determine a line of credit that corresponds with your financial means, we will first have to obtain information about you and verify your financial history. You will be required to provide us with your name, address, income, banking information and credit history. To determine your eligibility for credit, we may disclose your Personal Information to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions and other casinos. The information on our credit applications is required under the Regulations made pursuant to the Gaming Control Act, and is similar to the type of information a bank would require before extending a consumer loan. This information may be shared with other casinos including those taking part in the Loyalty Program. Such casinos may be located outside of Canada.</p>
<p>(c) <u><em>Other Financial Services.</em></u> As a service to customers, Caesars Windsor may open a front money account for you, advance you cash on your credit card, transfer your funds by wire to a financial institution, or permit you to use a safety deposit box. Before we can facilitate these services, we will require certain Personal Information. Depending on the type of service you are interested in, the Personal Information may include your name, address, date of birth, signature, etc. This information may be shared with other casinos including those taking part in the Loyalty Program. Such casinos may be located outside of Canada. Where these transactions (excluding use of safety deposit box) amount to Cdn.$10,000 or more in the gaming day, a Large Cash Transaction Record is required under law.</p>
<p>(d) <u><em>Large Cash Transaction, Large Casino Disbursement, and Multiple Transaction Records.</em></u> Under provincial and federal laws, Casinos are required to complete a Large Cash Transaction or Casino Disbursement Record before conducting any transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more (including multiple transactions, where cash is received from the same person, amounting to Cdn.$10,000 or more in a gaming day) and Multiple Action Logs before conducting certain transactions of Cdn.$2,500 or more in a gaming day. These records include Personal Information such as your name, address, date of birth, and business or principal occupation. Where we determine that a reportable transaction is being conducted on behalf of a third party, Personal Information on the third party is also required, including the third party’s name, address, date of birth, business or principal occupation and the nature of the relationship between you and the third party. In addition, we are required to report to the Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (“FINTRAC”), transactions where Cdn.$10,000 or more in cash is received (including multiple cash transactions, by the same person, amounting to Cdn.$10,000 or more in a gaming day) or when the total amount disbursed is Cdn.$10,000 or more (including multiple transactions amounting to Cdn.$10,000 or more in a gaming day. The recording and reporting requirements for large cash transactions and large casino disbursements apply not only to all casinos/slot facilities in the country, but also to all financial institutions, foreign exchange dealers and other regulated financial service providers.</p>
<p>(e) <u><em>Suspicious Transaction Reporting.</em></u> Under federal law, when an employee suspects, on reasonable grounds, that a transaction (regardless of the amount) or attempted transaction is related to the commission of, or attempted in the commission of, a money laundering offence or a terrorist activity financing offence, a Suspicious Transaction Report must be filed with FINTRAC. Certain Personal Information about the person conducting the transaction is required on these reports. Federal law prohibits us from disclosing that a Suspicious Transaction Report has been completed or reported, or the content of such a report.</p>
<p>(f) <u><em>Self-Exclusion Forms.</em></u> If you have difficulty in gaming responsibly, or for whatever reason, you may wish to complete a Self-Exclusion Form. The form requires that you disclose your name, address, date of birth, and a piece of ID, and that you allow us to take a photograph of you. This information is shared with OLG, all gaming premises in the Province of Ontario and all casinos owned, operated or managed by Caesars and its affiliates, for purposes of the self-exclusion program.</p>
<p>(g) <u><em>Security Incidents.</em></u> Details of security incidents, such as assaults, thefts, drunkenness or disorderly conduct, etc., are recorded. If you are involved in or witness a security incident, you may be asked to provide us with your name, address, and telephone number.</p>

As a result, any report sent by the Operator to FINTRAC will also be shared with OLG. OLG has responsibilities under federal law to develop and administer anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing programs. Such programs are required to assess and evaluate information and activities taking place across all casinos in Ontario, whether operated by OLG itself or by a third party operator on behalf of OLG. As a result, in addition to providing OLG with reports sent to FINTRAC, all third party operators of casinos in Ontario are required to provide additional Personal Information relating to their customers to OLG in certain circumstances. This information may include name and contact information, date of birth, employment information, casino assigned player number or risk level, government issued identification numbers, information about accounts, transactions and gaming activity, and any other personal information that is reasonably required by OLG to effectively administer its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing program. OLG uses the information it receives from all casino operators for the purposes of administering its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing programs. OLG may also disclose personal information received from the Operator to FINTRAC. OLG is governed by its own Privacy Policy which can be found at www.OLG.ca and includes contact information to reach an OLG representative in case you have any questions regarding the OLG Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Caesars Total Rewards and Adoption of Successor or Replacement Loyalty Program.</strong> We disclose information we receive from you, and about your transactions or Loyalty Program participation with us, with Caesars Entertainment the operator of the Total Rewards Loyalty Program, and such information may be available to all other partners participating in the Loyalty Program. If we join or implement a new Loyalty Program, this will, among other things, allow the partners of the new Loyalty Program to recognize you and to quickly respond to applications for credit or financial services at their respective properties to better serve our customers. The Caesars Total Rewards Loyalty Program and any new Loyalty Programs may be located outside of Canada. The use and disclosure of Personal Information by Caesars Total Rewards and any new Loyalty Programs located in other countries (including the United States) will be subject to the laws of that country, which may differ from the laws of Canada and may include, for example, lawful requirements to disclose Personal Information to government authorities in those countries. The Total Rewards program is not operated by Caesars Windsor, and Personal Information connected with the program will be subject to Caesars Privacy Policy.

<p><strong>VI. SECURITY SAFEGUARDS</strong></p>
<p>Caesars Windsor strives to ensure that its security measures will protect against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, use or modification of information. Such measures will vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, format, nature and storage of the information and will involve, as applicable, physical, organizational and electronic security measures.</p>
<p><strong>VII. LEGAL AGE POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Caesars Windsor does not knowingly or intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from, or market to, individuals under the age of 19. If you know of a minor who has provided us with personally identifiable information, please contact us immediately so that we may identify the information that needs to be removed from our database. No information collected through the sites from users self-identified as minors will knowingly be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside of outside Caesars Windsor.</p>
<p>Ontario law prohibits anyone under the age of 19 from entering casino gaming establishments. Individuals who appear to be under 30 years of age will be asked to provide government issued photo identification. Acceptable valid government issued photo identification may include, but is not limited to: drivers license, military identification card, passport or immigration papers. Two pieces of identification will be required from those individuals 19 to 21 years of age. An acceptable second piece of identification from those individuals 19 to 21 years of age may include, but is not limited to: credit card, bank card or passport. Although all ages are welcome in our Augustus Tower and convention complex, only persons 19 years of age or older will be permitted in the casino and related outlets. Thus, any offers we make or any contests we conduct whether online or offline, unless otherwise noted, are not open to persons younger than 19 years of age. Further, persons younger than 19 year of age are not allowed to use our website, accept offers, or win contests, and we do not knowingly collect information from such persons. We reserve the right to verify age at any time for any reason and may reject a person who does not have valid age identification from participating on any part of our website. Affiliated sites and casinos may have different legal age requirements and policies which will apply when you interact with those sites and/or casinos.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. OTHER WEBSITES</strong></p>
<p>Our website contains links to other websites owned and operated by third parties. The third parties who operate these sites may treat the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information differently than we do. This could be the case even for those websites which carry Caesars Windsor’s trade-marks or logos or which are framed by this website. We therefore encourage you to review the privacy policies of these websites before disclosing your information to any third party. Caesars Windsor is not responsible for the data collection, use and disclosure practices of companies or organizations to which our website may provide links.</p>
<p><strong>IX. HOW TO ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>XII. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO AND THE ONTARIO PROVINCIAL POLICE (OPP)</strong></p>
<p>The AGCO is an agency of the Government of Ontario. The AGCO is responsible for ensuring that gaming in this province is conducted with honesty and integrity. This involves overseeing the operation of Ontario’s gaming facilities. Officers of the OPP are seconded to the AGCO to carry out law enforcement activities within gaming facilities.</p>
<p>Regulations made pursuant to the Gaming Control Act require that gaming facility operators install video surveillance in certain parts of the facilities. OPP officers monitor the video surveillance in order to identify any illegal activity. In cases where illegal activity is suspected, OPP officers carry out an investigation. Some investigations may involve use of facial recognition information comparing a facial scan to a database of known or suspected criminals.</p>
<p>Patrons of gaming facilities do not automatically have their facial recognition information gathered by the OPP when they enter a gaming facility. Facial recognition information is gathered and used strictly in the course of police investigations. Access to information gathered by OPP officers is restricted to the officers who are assigned to work in the gaming facility. All information gathered is protected by sophisticated systems. Once an investigation is completed, the relevant face recognition information is removed from the OPP database. The collection of facial recognition information described in this section is separate from and in addition to the facial recognition information collected pursuant to the self-exclusion program described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The AGCO gathers Personal Information in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for the purpose of law enforcement. Anyone seeking access to the information must meet the requirements set out in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. If you have any questions or would like more information about the role of the AGCO or its use of face recognition, please contact:</p>
<p>Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario<br>
