              <p>In the State of New Hampshire, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has access to appropriate information obtained and held by the government. At the same time, the State recognizes that personal information collected by the State should be used only for the purpose for which it is collected. Except as authorized by law, such information will not be disclosed to other persons or organizations. Therefore, it is the policy of the State of New Hampshire that all personal information collected by state government Web sites shall be subject to the following principles:</p>
			  <ul>
			  <li><em>Electronic information</em> - information collected and held   electronically shall be afforded the same protection as non-electronic information;</li>  
			  <li><em>Collection of personal information</em> - the collection of personal information shall be limited to and consistent with the requirements of the   government program or activity;</li>
			  <li><em>Use of personal information</em> - individuals shall be informed as to   why information is being collected and how it will be used;</li>
			  <li><em>Disclosure of personal information</em> - disclosure of information shall be limited to the purpose for which it was collected unless otherwise   authorized by law; when practical and provided by law, information may be obtained from other government entities;</li>
			  <li><em>Access to personal information</em> - individuals shall be allowed a reasonable opportunity to obtain access to their personal information and to ensure that it is correct; and</li>
			  <li><em>Security precautions</em> - reasonable precautions shall be taken to   ensure the security of personal information.</li>
                </ul>

                        <li>The type of hardware, browser and operating system used to access our site;</li>
                        <li>The date and time you access our site;</li>
                        <li>The number of bytes of data transmitted during your visit;</li>
						<li>Transaction and routing information to and from your computer;</li>
                        <li>The pages you visit; and</li>
                        <li>If you linked to our site from another Web site, the address of that Web   site (URL).</li>
                    </ul>
                        <p>This information is used for purposes such as assessing what information is of most interest to users and system enhancements.</p>
                      <p><strong>What about personal information voluntarily provided to the State?</strong></p>
                        <p>Unless you choose to do so (i.e. sending an E-mail, participating in a survey, responding to a feedback or "contact us" form, or applying for benefits or State services), State of New Hampshire Web sites do not obtain personally identifying information.</p>
                        <p>We consider any information that could reasonably be used to identify you as "personally identifying information." This may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your name;</li>

                            <li>License or identification number;</li>
                            <li>Telephone number;</li>
                            <li>Medical or disability information;</li>
                            <li>Any combination of data that could be used to identify you such as birth   date, zip code and gender; and</li>
                            <li>Any graphical or visual representation of you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Government agencies may request personally identifying information from you in order to provide requested services, but such information is handled as it would be on an in-person visit to a government office.</p>
                        <p>If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by the user, State law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection, distribution and copying if not protected by federal or State   law.</p>
                      <p><strong>How can I access and correct my personal information?</strong></p>
                        <p>Persons concerned about information contained in their personal records   should contact the custodian of the record, which typically is the State agency   or other governmental entity that collects and maintains the information.</p>
