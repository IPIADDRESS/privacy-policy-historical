        CWIE, LLC. and its affiliates (collectively "CWIE") are committed 
        to protecting the privacy of visitors to this Website ("Site") 
        and other CWIE Websites. To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive 
        Privacy Policy that governs all information collected on or submitted 
        to our Site. By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge 
        that you read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of CWIE's 
        Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please 
        do not access, browse, or use this Site. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>THE 
        INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT:</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> 
        1. Non-Personal and Aggregated Information. </strong><br>
        When you visit our Site, we may log general data, such as your domain 
        name (e.g., CWIE.com), the name of the Web page from which you entered 
        our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much time you spend 
        on each page. We use this information to continually monitor and improve 
        our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses 
        to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather 
        information for aggregate use. (IP addresses are not linked to personally 
        identifiable information.) </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>2. 
        Personal Information. </strong><br>
        As a visitor to our Site, you may choose to use the Site to send us personal 
        information (e.g., your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail 
        address), for example, when you send a question via the Site, register 
        for a particular service, or submit your resume through our Site. Anytime 
        you submit personal information for a specific purpose using the Site, 
        your information is used for that purpose only, unless you consent otherwise 
        or as required by law. When you submit personal information to CWIE on 
        this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred 
        across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in another 
        country, which may not provide privacy protections similar to those your 
        country provides.<br>
        We do not send unsolicited e-mail to you or other visitors to our Site. 
        We use e-mail to respond to e-mail messages from you, to confirm product 
        or service orders placed online and to engage in other communication that 
        you have authorized or that we have determined necessary to more effectively 
        service you and our customers. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many cases, 
        you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g., when sending us 
        information through the Site, you may choose to include only an e-mail 
        address - not a telephone number or mailing address - for replies). There 
        may be instances where some of the information that we ask you to provide 
        is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In such cases, if you 
        do not provide mandatory personal information with respect to a particular 
        activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>COOKIES: 
        </strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The term 
        "cookie" refers to files that are transferred from a Website 
        to your computer's hard drive. <br>
        CWIE does not use cookies except as expressly set forth in this Privacy 
        Policy. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>WHO 
        WE SHARE IT WITH: </strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We may share 
        non-personal, aggregated information with our customers, partners, and 
        advertisers. Aggregated information is not linked to any personal information 
        that can identify an individual person or website. <br>
        Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share the 
        personal information you provide through our Site with CWIE affiliates 
        and/or business partners that are acting on our behalf. We make every 
        reasonable effort to ensure that such CWIE affiliates and business partners, 
        including those in the U.S. and/or any other countries, protect your personal 
        information consistent with our Privacy Policy.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>OUR 
        COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY:</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To prevent 
        unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use 
        of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, 
        and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect 
        through the Site. Despite all of its best efforts, CWIE cannot guarantee 
        that your personal information will not be obtained illegally from CWIE’s 
        systems and you agree to assume all risk and liability arising from your 
        use of CWIE’s online services, including the risk of a breach in 
        the security of our systems. Also, please be advised that CWIE cannot 
        guarantee and has no control over the public or third party network through 
        which you send your personal information to CWIE's Site.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>OUR 
        COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY: </strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Protecting 
        the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we never 
        collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know 
        are under 18, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone 
        under 18. </font></p>

        INTERNET WEBSITES:</strong></font></p>
