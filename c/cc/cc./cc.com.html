Like many websites, CC.com's web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol addresses, but not the email addresses, of visitors. We may use this information to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site and pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the site. We may then use this information to analyze and improve the features and functionality of CC.com. This information is generally non-personally identifiable.
<br><br>
Sometimes, we may ask you for personal information, including your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, entertainment preferences and demographic information. We would likely collect this personal information when you purchase tickets or merchandise through CC.com or websites operated by related Clear Channel Worldwide companies or by CCEntertainment's suppliers such as Ticketmaster, or to register for certain services offered by us, enter sweepstakes or promotions we conduct, send email to CC.com, respond to emails from CC.com, post messages or upload content using CC.com. CCEntertainment also may combine this information from you with other personally identifiable information about you that we receive from other sources.
<br><br>
We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from CC.com. If you choose to opt-out of receiving such communications, send an email to <a href="mailto:clearchannel@custhelp.com">clearchannel@custhelp.com</a> or visit the following URL, <a href="http://clearchannel.custhelp.com">http://clearchannel.custhelp.com</a>.

<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="+0" color="#9999CC"><b>How We Use the Information We Collect</b></font><br><br>
We collect and store information about you and statistics about your use of our site both in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable way and in a manner that may allow us to identify you personally. For example, we may use information about you and other site visitors on an aggregated basis to sell and deliver advertising, promotions and content that we believe will be of interest to you. We may use personally identifiable information in similar ways. For example, we may use your email address to send you special announcements or notifications of events or services that may be of interest to you and to verify and authorize the use of your credit card. We may use your mailing address to fulfill orders of merchandise and tickets as well as to send you announcements and notifications that may be of interest to you.
<br><br>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="+0" color="#9999CC"><b>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</b></font><br><br>
Our site may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These technologies consist of small amounts of computer code sent to your browser by websites, and that are stored on your hard drive. We may use them to improve the functionality of our site, to help us tailor the site to your interests, and to understand better how users use CC.com. They enable us to recognize you when you return and can keep track of information specific to you. We use them to improve the functionality of our site, and we will not use these technologies to transfer information about you to others except as otherwise provided in this privacy statement.
<br><br>
Sometimes, you may receive such cookies or other files from advertisers or other sites that you link to from CC.com. This is common practice on the Internet. We do not control these files and they are not subject to this privacy policy. You may set your browser to require your permission before you receive a cookie.
<br><br>
<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size="+0" color="#9999CC"><b>Disclosing User Information to Third Parties</b></font><br>
<br>
From time to time, we may share your email address with venues where events occur, with promoters of events, with other Clear Channel Worldwide companies and with third parties. Whenever possible, CCEntertainment will provide you the opportunity to opt out of sharing your information with third parties except when it is necessary for the purpose it was collected or to fulfill a transaction. The venue, promoter, Clear Channel Worldwide company or third party may send you announcements and notifications of events, products or services that might be of interest to you. These announcements may include gift certificates, sweepstakes, contests, promotions, giveaways and merchandise offerings. Your mailing address will be shared with your credit card company in order to verify that you are an authorized user. It will also be shared with the venue, promoter of the ticketed event or ticket agent, such as Ticketmaster, in order for them to mail tickets or event information to you. 
<br><br>
When you make purchases on the Site or use certain features on the Site, we request you to provide financial information such as account or credit card numbers. We will use your financial information to bill you for products and services or otherwise process your transactions. By making a purchase on the Site, you consent to our providing your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine is necessary to process your transactions. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process the transaction. By purchasing products or services of third parties (such as magazine subscriptions) offered on the Site or when you purchase tickets on the Site from our ticketing partners, you also consent to our providing your financial information to those third parties. Any of these various third parties are authorized to use your financial information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control.
<br><br>
From time to time, we may enter into a relationship with another company that is not owned by CCEntertainment or affiliated with us. These relationships may include "powered by" partners, business or ticketing affiliates, sponsors and co-branded sites. Personal information that you have provided us may be shared with these third parties. Also, when you purchase event tickets directly from us on a CCEntertainment website, on a co-branded page, or from a ticketing agent such as Ticketmaster, your information will be shared with the venues, promoters, artists and other third parties associated with the event for which you buy tickets. Because these third parties will use information about you in accordance with their own privacy rules, you should check their websites for their privacy policies.
<br><br>
In some situations, the law will require us to disclose information about you to the government or other third parties, or third parties may unlawfully intercept Internet transmissions or private communications. If asked or required by law, we may release information about you to law enforcement, other government officials or private entities if we believe it is necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries.
<br><br>
