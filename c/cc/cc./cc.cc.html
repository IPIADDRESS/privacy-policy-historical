<span class="title">CC.CC Network Privacy Statement</span><br><br>


<b>CC.CC respects and protects your privacy<br>
We will not give any information about you to others without your   express permission.</b><br>
<br>
Our site uses forms in which you give us   contact information (your name, address, daytime telephone number, and email   address) so you can place orders, request information and support, and make   product suggestions. We will then create an account number for you and if you   choose to order from us using a credit card, we will collect your credit card   number and expiration date. If you contact us for support, we will keep an   internal record of what support was given. We use your customer information only   when it will be important for us to contact you regarding functionality changes   to our products, our web site, new CC.CC Software services, and special offers   we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information,   please see the "My Account" section below on how to change your preferences. If   we present a co-branded offer with our partners or affiliates, it will be clear   at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy   statement applies. <br>
<br>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.   These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel   gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that   these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. <br>
<br>On rare occasions, one of our partners may require us to share your personal   information with them. We will only do so with your explicit permission first. <br>
<br>We use information gathered about you from our site statistics (for example   your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer   our Web site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to   help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more   enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except   as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system. <br>
<br>Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and receipts. We   use cookies to identify you so you don't have to login each time you visit our   site. They are linked to your customer number which is associated with the   information in your account. <br>
<br>This site also contains links to other sites. Unfortunately CC.CC is not   responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. <br>
<br><b>Security</b><br>
<br>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and   alteration of the information under our control. <br>
<br><b>Updating Your Information</b> <br>
<br>As a customer of CC.CC , you may alter your customer information or opt-out   of receiving communications from us and our partners at any time. We have the   following options for changing and modifying your customer information.<br>
<br>- You may send an email to sales@CC.CC <br>

- Or you may fax us at   +82-31-919-6150<br>
<br>
<b>Emails</b> <br>
<br>We use emails to communicate with you, to confirm your placed orders, and to   send information that you have requested. We also provide email links, as on our   "About Us" page, to allow you to contact us directly. We strive to promptly   reply to your messages. <br>
<br>The information you send to us may be stored and used to improve this site   and our products, or it may be reviewed and discarded. However, your information   will only be shared with third parties with your explicit permission. <br>
<br><b>Only If We Have To</b><br>
<br>As stated previously in this policy, we will not share your personal   information except with a third party to assist us in the processing or securing   of your personal information or when we are required by law unless we have given   you notice and choice, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in   order to conform to the edicts of the law, or we must comply with a legal   process served on our web site. We may also need to give out your information if   one of our partners requires it, but these situations are rare. <br>
<br><b>Changes in Our Practices</b><br>
<br>If we make material changes to our information handling practices or other   privacy aspects, we will post those changes on this privacy statement, at least   30 days prior to their implementation or notify you directly via email. Minor   changes will be immediately effective upon reposting to this privacy policy on   the CC.CC Software Web site. <br>
<br><b>Service Provider</b><br>
<br>We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.   These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable   information for any secondary purposes. <br>
<br><b>Affiliates</b><br>
<br>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our   site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. CC.CC will   automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.   CC.CC stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time   email. The friend may contact CC.CC at support@CC.CC to request the removal of   this information from our database. <br>
<br><b>If I Terminate my CC.CC Account</b><br>
<br>When Your CC.CC account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily)   all of your personally identifiable information is placed in "deactivated"   status on our relevant CC.CC databases. However, you should know that   deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable   information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use   your personally identifiable information if necessary in order to resolve   disputes or enforce our agreements.<br>
