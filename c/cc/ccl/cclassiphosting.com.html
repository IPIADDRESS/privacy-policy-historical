<ul class="pp-li2">
<li><strong>a.</strong>	No client can use 25% or more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds. Performing activities such as CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc can cause this problem.</li>
<li><strong>b.</strong>	Please do not run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.</li>

<p>
</p><li class="pp-li1">9. Bandwidth Usage</li>
You will be provided with bandwidth allowance. The limit of allowance will depend on the hosting package you are buying.
