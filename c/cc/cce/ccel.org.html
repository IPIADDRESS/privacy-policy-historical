<p>Because we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it, 
we have adopted this Privacy Policy. 
This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is 
used. We will use your personal information only in ways that are 
compatible with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>There are several CCEL services that require the collection of personal 
or non-personal information from you. These services include making purchases
through the CCEL Store and signing up with a user name and password to enable
you to edit digital facsimile edition documents or add contributions to the
bibliography. Other services may set cookies on your computer. These include
installing books on your computer and managing your personal preferences.

</p><h3>CCEL Store</h3>
<p>The CCEL store works in collaboration with 
<a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>.  PayPal is governed by its own privacy 
policy statement, and the CCEL is not responsible for its operations, 
including but not limited to its information practices.  Users 
concerned about submitting information to or through PayPal should review 
their <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy">privacy
statement.</a></p>
<p>We receive from paypal.com only your name, address, email, and order
information. This information is used only internally, and it is not sold or
rented to other parties. You will not be placed on any mailing lists unless
you give permission to do so.

</p><h3>Our Use of "Cookies"</h3>
<p>Cookies are small bits of data that we send to your computer. They 
identify you as a CCEL user and contain information regarding your 
locally installed CCEL location and
your CCEL preferences such as your preferred Bible version and note location. 
There are also a couple of cookies that are used to remember the last 
few pages you've visited.  These cookies are implemented to overcome 
inadequecies in many browsers that prevent you from returning to a 
previous page when there are parameters being passed in. Short-term
cookies are used for passing parameters into web pages. </p>

<p>The cookies are not used for tracking users outside
the CCEL website, and they are not accessible to third 
parties. </p>

<h3>Website traffic information</h3>
<p>When you visit this or any website, information is available to the 
site on the pages you view, the time of your visit, the browser you
are using, the address of the computer you visit from, and the
address of the page you are coming from. We use this information
internally only, to better understand user needs and preferences and 
make the CCEL more useful. We do not share this information with 
third parties unless required by law, and we do not track web sites
you visit before or after your visit to the CCEL.</p>

<h3>Our Use and Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>The CCEL will not sell or rent any of your personally 
identifiable information to third parties. 
</p>

<p>The CCEL does not send unsolicited email to users unless those
users have voluntarily joined an email list such as the ccel-list
or given permission to receive CCEL announcements. 
</p>

<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to CCEL 
or as we incorporate suggestions from our users.  The CCEL is not 
responsible for notifying users of changes to this policy.</p>

<p>We will post the amended Privacy Policy promptly on our Web site so 
that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use 
that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check 
the CCEL Web site at 
<a href="http://www.ccel.org/info/privacy.html">www.ccel.org/info/privacy.html</a> 
for the current version of our Privacy Policy.</p>
