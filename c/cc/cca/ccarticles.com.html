<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">What Are
Cookies?</font></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><br>

<font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">A cookie is a very small
text
document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.
When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your
computer for permission to store this file in a part of your
hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site
can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your
browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has
already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other
sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if
you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the
configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose
to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some
areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed
by the users.</font></span><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif"><font size="2"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A cookie cannot
retrieve
any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer
viruses.</span></b></font></font></div>

Collect from
Cookies?</font></span></strong><br>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">As you visit and browse our Web
site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other
users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from
having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies,
in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to
calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site
and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us
gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better
serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any
personal information about you and we do not intentionally
store any personal information that your browser provided to us
in your cookies.</font></span><br>

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">IP
Addresses</font></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><br>

<font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">IP addresses are used by
your
computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP
address is a number that is used by computers on the network to
identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically
collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile
data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages
you request) can be sent to you.</font></span><br>
