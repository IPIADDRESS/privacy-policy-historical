<p><strong>Clser.com Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  </p>
<p>Clser.com was created to help people discover new information  by enabling them to share what they find interesting with one another. We know  that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we  take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about  our privary policy. By visiting the Clser.com website, you are accepting the  practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
  This Privacy Policy covers Clser.com's treatment of personal  information that Clser.com gathers when you are on the Clser.com website and  when you use Clser.com services. This policy does not apply to the practices of  third parties that Clser.com does not own or control, or to individuals that Clser.com  does not employ or manage.<br>
  Information Collected by Clser.com</p>
<p><br>
  We only collect personal information that is relevant to the  purpose of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share information  with one another. This information allows us to provide you with a customized  and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is  incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information  from our Clser.com users:</p>
<p><br>
  1. Information You Provide to Us:<br>
  We receive and store any information you enter on our website  or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with  certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of  our special features.<br>
  - Registration: In order for you to use Clser.com services,  such as submitting new links to the website, you must complete a registration  form. As part of this registration form, we require your personal information  (including your full name, city, state and e-mail address).<br>
  - User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond the  information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional  information, such as a bio, favorite URLs, and instant messaging IDs. In  addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As  indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information",  you can control how your information is displayed and used.<br>
  </p>
<p>2. Automatic Information:<br>
  - We receive and store certain types of information whenever  you interact with us. Clser.com and its authorized agents automatically receive  and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your  browser including your IP address, Clser.com cookie information, and the page  you requested. Clser.com uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with  its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.<br>
  - Clser.com may collect and, on any page, display the total  counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.<br>
  - Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites  anonymously. While Clser.com will not be able to provide you with a  personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware  that these programs are available.<br>
  </p>
<p>E-mail Communications<br>
  Clser.com is concerned about your privacy and will never  provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission,  as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. Clser.com  may send out e-mails with Clser.com-related news, products, offers, surveys or  promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Clser.com, informing  you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site. If  you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the Email Preferences  section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the  unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases you will  continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user  passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p><br>
- Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we tranfer to your  computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are  visited and by how many people. Clser.com cookies do not collect personal  information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with  other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or  e-mail address is.</p>
<p><br>
- The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority  of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new  cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or  how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated  because cookies allow you to use some of Clser.com's coolest features.</p>
<p><br>
  - Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use  cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.<br>
</p>
<p>Sharing Your Information</p>
<p><br>
Because Clser.com enables people to discover and share  information with one another, information about the people who use Clser.com is  an integral part of the Clser.com experience. Rest assured that we neither rent  nor sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your  personal information only as described below.</p>
<p><br>

<p><br>
- Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or  sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one  of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Clser.com, or  substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one  of the assets that is transferred.</p>
<p><br>
- Protection of Clser.com and Others: We may release personal  information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply  with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to  protect the rights, property, or safety of Clser.com, our employees, our users,  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and  organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p><br>
- User Profile information: Information collected during  registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be  displayed to other Clser.com users in your User Profile. The User Profile is  the area on Clser.com where we allow you to tell other Clser.com users about  yourself and your interests. You may control what personal information is  displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your  User Profile.</p>
<p><br>
- Member Directory: The e-mail address that you submit upon  registration will be searchable by other Clser.com users who know you by your  email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature. This is primarily  so that other users can find you to establish friendship through Clser.com. You  may opt-out of this feature by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your  User Profile.</p>
<p><br>
- Social sharing of data: Clser.com allows other users to  browse stories that you have Socialized, submitted, blogged, or commented on.  This information is made available via your User Profile or within the  permalink URL of the story on which you performed the action. Clser.com may  choose to post this data on other site features.</p>
<p><br>
- Friends' Activity: Much like other online social networks, Clser.com  allows non-friends to browse your friends' activity ( Clser.com.com/users/usersname/friends).</p>
<p><br>
  - With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you  when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a  purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected,  and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping Information Secure<br>
- Your Clser.com account information is protected by a password  for your privacy and security. Protect against unauthorized access to your  password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a  shared computer.</p>
<p><br>
- Only employees who need personal information to perform a  specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted  access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and  security practices.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information<br>
  - As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose  information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website,  such as posting new links.<br>

<p><br>
- If you do not wish to receive e-mail from us or other Clser.com  users, please visit the Email Preferences section of your User Profile and/or  follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message.</p>
<p><br>

<p><br>

<p><br>
- As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the  toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your  browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when  you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note,  however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to  take advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>
