This statement governs information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of the CloudMade Service and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information.</p><h3>The Information CloudMade Collects</h3><p><strong>User Provided Information</strong>: You may provide to CloudMade what is generally called "personally identifiable" information when you register, such as screen name, e-mail, country and city. In addition, CloudMade may give you the option to provide us with certain demographic information about yourself.</p><p><strong>"Cookies" Information</strong>: When you visit the CloudMade Service, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. CloudMade uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the CloudMade Service. By using these cookies, we can "remember" what you have done on the CloudMade Service before and personalize our site for you. These persistent types of cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality and site offerings available via the CloudMade Service.</p><p><strong>"Automatically Collected" Information</strong>: When you visit the CloudMade Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons". This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the CloudMade Service, the pages you view on our site, and the dates and times that you visit.</p><h3>The Way CloudMade Uses Information</h3><p>CloudMade uses the information that we collect to provide to you all of the features and services found on the CloudMade Service. We will use your email address, without further consent, for non-marketing or administrative purposes such as notifying you of major site updates.</p><p>CloudMade may use all of the information that we collect from our Users to understand the usage trends and preferences, to improve the way the CloudMade Service works and looks, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to create new features and functionality.</p><p>CloudMade may use automatically collected information and cookies information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the CloudMade Service; (b) provide custom, personalized advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.</p><p>CloudMade will not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send promotional or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt.</p><h3>When CloudMade Discloses Information</h3><p>CloudMade may disclose both personally identifiable and automatically collected information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to process such information on our behalf, to provide website maintenance and security, to offer certain features on the CloudMade Service, to assist us in improving the way the CloudMade Service works and looks, and to create new features.

They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.</p><p>CloudMade does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks CloudMade to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</p><p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. CloudMade’s Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.</p><h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3><p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
