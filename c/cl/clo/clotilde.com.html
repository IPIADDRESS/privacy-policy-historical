<p><strong>Personal Information  Collected By DRG</strong><br>
  From time to time while on a DRG <u><a href="http://drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_websites.html">Web site</a></u>, we may ask  you to provide personal information such as your name, address, telephone  number, e-mail address and credit card information.
