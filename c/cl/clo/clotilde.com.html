<p>Dynamic Resource Group may also share this non-identifiable information with third parties from time to time.</p>
<p><b>Personal Information Collected By Dynamic Resource Group</b><br>
From time to time while on a Dynamic Resource Group <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_websites.html" target="_new">Web site</a>, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. We may ask you to provide personal information when making a purchase, setting up an account, or joining one of our online programs. Dynamic Resource Group will use your personal information for the purpose for which it was provided and as otherwise set forth herein. Dynamic Resource Group may combine your personal information with information collected by its  <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_companies.html" target="_new">subsidiaries</a> or share it among its   <a href="http://www.drgnetwork.com/pages/privacy_companies.html" target="_new">subsidiaries</a>.

As such, we may share the e-mail addresses of persons who have opted out with these third parties for the sole purpose of scrubbing their e-mail marketing lists with our opt-out list to remove the e-mail addresses of those persons who have opted to no longer receive our commercial e-mail announcements.</p>
