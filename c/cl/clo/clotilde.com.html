Dynamic Resource Group values your privacy and the security of your information. We utilize firewalls, secure access storage facilities and other means to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.</p>
<p>Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure online commerce transactions.

<p>Dynamic Resource Group and its family of companies will not share your e-mail address with other companies. However, we want to ensure those who have opted out no longer receive commercial e-mail from us.
