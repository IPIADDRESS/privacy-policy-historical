Beyond the personal information your are giving us to register for an account, CloudWork will gather some generic information automatically. This information may include the IP address or cookie information assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors to the Site, the URL that you just came from and where you next go to, and your computer browser information. This generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. This type of aggregate data may help us determine better customer service and Site needs. CloudWork may use this data in aggregate form, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. We may provide aggregate information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Site and Service.</p><h2>External Links</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to the CloudWork Site and Service only. We do not exercise control over any sites that you may visit from a link on our Site. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. </p><h2>User Consent</h2><p>By sending your personal data, you declare to have read and accepted the terms of this Policy. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, you expressly and unequivocally consent to:</p><ul><li>the collection and processing of your professional contact details by CloudWork in accordance with the indicated purposes established by CloudWork and this Policy;</li><li>the processing of your data outside the European Economic Area by third party data processors (e.g. for the purpose of providing professional services to us such as hosting or database management services); and</li><li>the reception of commercial e-mails from CloudWork, in accordance with the applicable laws on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce.</li><li>the communication of the data to other site Users outside the European Economic Area at the request of the User.</li></ul><p>Your consent to personal data collection and processing may be revoked in accordance to Sections 6 and 11 of Spanish Data Protection Basic Law 15/1999.</p><h2>Data Disclosure</h2><p>CloudWork warrants that it treats your personal data with strict confidentiality in accordance with applicable law.
