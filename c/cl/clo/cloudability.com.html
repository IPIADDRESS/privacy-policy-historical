              <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect the personal information you provide when you use the Services provided by Cloudability through the Cloudability Site.  Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in the Cloudability Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
<p>In order to access and use the Service, you will need to register and provide us your Registration Information which will contain personal information about you.  “Personal Information” means information or data that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, address, phone number, fax number or email address.  We use and disclose your Personal Information only as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To analyze usage and improve the Service;</li>
<li>To deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications regarding the Service;</li>
<li>To fulfill your requests for certain products and services;</li>
<li>For market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</li>
<li>To third-party contractors that provide services for us and who are bound by these same privacy restrictions;</li>
<li>To enforce the Terms of Service; and</li>
<li>As otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also ask that you provide us with your Account Information to allow us to access your cloud services accounts.  We use your Account Information, which may contain Personal Information, to access your accounts in order to provide you the Service.  By providing us with your Account Information, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retrieve and store your Account Information in order to make such Account Information available and viewable through the Service. </p>

<p>From time to time we may request other Personal Information to provide you with other benefits of the Service.  In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used for the stated purpose and/or in accordance with our then-current Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>When you visit the Cloudability Site, we may also collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on the Cloudability Site. This information is not personally identifiable.  Like many online services, we also use “cookies” to collect information.  “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of data files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive.  We may set and access cookies on your computer to monitor usage history and to store your preferences and login information.  Most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer, however, if you choose to eliminate cookies, the functionality of the Service will be significantly impaired and it will not operate properly.  We, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons to collect certain usage information.  Web beacons are images embedded in a web page or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity.</p>

<p>We use this information to provide, enhance and improve the Service and the Cloudability Site, to improve our design and functionality of the Service, to monitor and analyze the use of the Service, for the technical administration of the Service, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of the Service, to better tailor the Cloudability Site to your needs, to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and usage behavior of our users, to provide you with offers for products and services that are relevant to you, and to verify that our users meet the criteria required to access the Services.</p>

<p>We may disclose such non-personally identifiable information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular Cloudability offer;</li>
<li>	Cloud services providers for market research and analytical purposes, such as cloud spending and usage; and</li>
<li>	Other users of the Service, such as for purposes of comparison of their cloud usage and situation relative to the broader community.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending e-mail messages on our behalf or hosting, payment processing and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service. Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your Personal Information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they're providing. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.</p>

<h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to share or disclose your Personal Information when we reasonably determine, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information is necessary or appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>To enforce our rights against you or in connection with a breach by you of this Privacy Policy or the  Terms of Service;</li>
<li>To prevent any activity we consider to be prohibited or illegal or damaging to our Service or other users; or</li>
<li>When required by any applicable law, rule regulation, subpoena or other legal process.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, your Personal Information may be transferred to a third party as a result of an asset sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change of control or if we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your Personal Information.   </p>

<h2>ACCESSING AND CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>You can review, update, and correct the Registration information you provide us through your account.  You can also remove or delink your Account Information through your account.</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>We take precautions — including technical, administrative and physical measures — to safeguard your information.  We use a combination of firewall barriers, data encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect your Personal Information, Account Information and our systems from unauthorized access.  We also enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files.  </p>

<p>Your Personal Information is stored and located on a secured server behind a firewall.  We only authorize access to Personal Information for those employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Service.  These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.  </p>

<p>Your Account Information is also stored and located on a secured server behind a firewall.  We use PGP encryption for all of your Account Information, in storage and when in transit.  Only our executive officers have the ability to access unencrypted versions of your Account Information.</p>

<h2>LINKS</h2>
<p>The Cloudability Site may contain links to other websites.  As such, Cloudability does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third party websites.  We exercise no control over how your information is stored, maintained or displayed by third parties or on third-party sites.</p>

<h2>INTERNATIONAL USERS</h2>
<p>Your Information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Cloudability transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<h2>OUR POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.  If you, as a parent or guardian, become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us.  If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided us with Personal Information without verifiable parental consent, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

<h2>CHANGES</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Service or to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.  If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on the Service or providing you with notice of the modification.  We will try, when possible, to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any changes taking effect.  We will indicate when such terms are effective below.  By continuing to access or use the Service after we have posted a modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.  If the modified Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Service.</p>
