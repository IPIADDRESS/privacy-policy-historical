<h1>Clover Network Privacy Policy</h1>

<div id="container" class="container tos">
<p>Last Updated Date: May 17, 2011
</p>

<p>Clover Network, Inc. ("<strong>Clover</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>") provides our proprietary deal based marketing platform and
  personalization service (the "<strong>Personalized Commerce Network</strong>" or "<strong>PCN</strong>"). The PCN includes our website
  located at <a href="http://www.clover.com" target="_blank">www.clover.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>"), other online areas owned
  or controlled by us and any of our software applications through which users can access the PCN (the "<strong>Clover Solution</strong>").
</p>

<p>Clover has relationships with sellers or providers of goods and services, which offer vouchers for purchase via the PCN
  ("<strong>Merchants</strong>") and publishers that deploy the Clover Solution on their websites or online services
  ("<strong>Publishers</strong>") to facilitate the serving of Merchant vouchers (each a "<strong>Clover Solution Widget</strong>") to
  consumers that visit a Publisher's website or online service. Clover provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and
  procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from (i) consumers who view and/or interact
  with a Clover Solution Widget or our Site, including Registered Users ("<strong>Clover Consumers</strong>"); and (ii) our Publishers
  and Merchants. As used herein, "<strong>Registered User</strong>" means an end user who has registered with us and created a Clover
  account which enables, among other things, the personalization of such user's experience with Clover Solution Widgets as further
  described in this Privacy Policy; and "<strong>Clover Partner</strong>" means collectively Publishers and Merchants. </p>

<p><strong>This Privacy Policy is organized in three parts: </strong></p>

<p><a href="#consumer">Part A - Provides information specific to Clover Consumer data</a></p>

<p><a href="#partner">Part B - Provides information specific to Clover Partner data</a></p>

<p><a href="#general">Part C - Provides information specific to all PCN user data: Clover Consumers and Clover Partners</a></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
  through the Clover Solution or on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. </p>

<p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information
  to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing,
  evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our
  affiliates within the United States or internationally. </p>

<h3><a name="consumer"></a>A. CLOVER CONSUMERS</h3>

<p>This section of the Privacy Policy applies <i>only</i> to information that Clover may collect, access or obtain about
  Clover Consumers.</p>

<h3>Clover Consumer Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h3>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features and content, to administer your Clover
  account and to deliver Clover Solution Widgets that may be of interest to you. </p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>In connection with your use of the PCN (including the Site or any Clover Solution Widget), we may ask you for personally identifiable
  information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").
  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card number, email address and postal address.
  We use your Personal Information mainly to administer your inquiries and to provide you with the services you request through your use
  of the PCN. For example, if you wish to purchase a voucher via a Clover Solution Widget you will need to provide us with your credit card
  information or other payment details. (See the <a href="https://www.clover.com/tos" target="_blank">Clover Network Terms of Service</a>
  for more information regarding the purchase of vouchers.) As a Registered User, we will use your Personal Information to deliver Clover
  Solution Widgets containing voucher offers based on your preferences and purchasing behavior. (See the Sections below titled
  "<strong>Experience Personalization</strong>" and "<strong>For Registered Users</strong>" for further information.) </p>

<p>You can become a Registered User through the Site or through a third party social networking site (each an "<strong>Entry Point Site</strong>")
  (including, but not limited to, Facebook) where we may decide to make the Clover Solution available. If you decide to register via an Entry
  Point Site you may do so by clicking on the login or registration button or link available on the Entry Point Site and when you do so we will
  extract the Personal Information from the account you have with such Entry Point Site (such as your "real" name, profile picture, email address
  and other information that you have made publicly available via the applicable service) and use that information to link your Clover account to your Entry
  Point Site account, create your Clover account, and administer your use of the PCN;
  the information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Entry Point Site. You hereby consent to Clover's access to and
  collection of such Personal Information about you. It is your responsibility to read and accept the terms of use and privacy policies of Entry
  Point Sites when you use and interact with Entry Point Sites.</p>

<p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with our newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be
  of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe
  instructions provided in any of the communications or contact us.</p>

<p><strong>Experience Personalization:</strong> How we use Personal Information and non-identifying information to personalize your experience.</p>

<p><strong>For all Clover Consumers.</strong> To deliver Clover Solution Widgets to all Clover Consumers based on their inferred interests, we
  utilize the non-identifying information that we collect, access or obtain through commonly used web usage tracking technologies, including cookies,
  Pixel Tags (defined below) and similar technologies (collectively or individually "<strong>Web Usage Technologies</strong>") embedded on the
  webpage of a Publisher's website on which you view Clover Solution Widgets or that may be implemented in your browser (e.g., HTML5 caching), in
  conjunction with the information about you that is provided to us by our Clover Partners (i.e., Publishers and Merchants) as described below, to
  personalize the content of Clover Solution Widgets and recommend voucher offers that may be of interest to you. </p>

<p><strong>Interaction with Clover Solution Widgets and the Site.</strong> We use cookies to help us collect, maintain and use information. A cookie
  is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes when you are served a Clover Solution Widget, or use the
  Site. We use cookies to save your Clover account information for future logins to the PCN, to integrate your
  usage of the Clover Solution via the appropriate Entry Point Sites, and to monitor aggregate usage by Clover Consumers and web traffic routing on the
  Site. Cookies also help us better understand the effectiveness of a Clover Solution Widget (e.g., by tracking the way in which you respond to, select
  and interact with a Clover Solution Widget or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view a Clover Solution Widget). Our
  cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information and they can help control the number of times you are served a specific Clover Solution
  Widget. Third party advertisers on the Site or a Publisher's website may also place or read cookies on your browser. Clover does not have access to, or
  control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed by a third party, including those of our Publishers, and this Privacy
  Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party. </p>

<p>We may also use "pixel tags" "web beacons", "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>"), in combination
  with cookies and the data provided to us by our Clover Partners, to analyze usage patterns of Clover Consumers and to serve Clover Solution Widgets to
  you that are tailored based on our analysis of what we believe you would respond favorably to in light of the information that we have collected,
  accessed or obtained about you as described above. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic
  image that is placed on a webpage and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain
  websites and pages within websites, to personalize the Clover Solution Widgets, and to help determine the effectiveness of certain voucher offerings.
</p>

<p>When you interact with a Clover Solution Widget or visit the Site our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
  visit a website ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>")
  address, the geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet, browser type, operating system, access times and dates, and other
  statistics. We use this data and the non-identifying information that we collect, access and obtain
  through cookies and Pixel Tags to measure the effectiveness of the Clover Solution Widgets (e.g., whether you purchase or decline a voucher offer). Log
  Data collected from you when you visit our Site is also used by us for website usage analysis. </p>

<p><strong>Information we receive about you from Clover Partners.</strong> Independent of the information that we collect, access or obtain as described
  above, our Clover Partners also provide us with non-identifying information about their users, such as usage, demographic, and geographic information
  that does not personally identify an individual user (e.g., a user's gender, date of birth, hobbies, or interests). Occasionally, Clover Partners may
  also provide us with a limited amount of Personal Information about you (such as your name and email address) from time to time, in conjunction with
  this non-identifying information. This information is collected when you visit the websites of one of our Clover Partners or use their services,
  pursuant to such Clover Partner's information collection practices, which are typically outlined in a privacy policy like this one, provided on the
  Clover Partner's website. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and online services you visit. If you do not wish
  to allow Clover
  Partners to share your Personal Information with their third-party service providers (such as Clover), you should follow the instructions set forth in a
  given Clover Partner's privacy policy or otherwise provided by the Clover Partner to indicate to the Clover Partner that you do not wish such Personal
  Information to be so shared. Clover's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, such Clover Partners or other websites.
</p>

<p><strong>For Registered Users.</strong>In addition to the personalization described above, when you create a Clover account and become a Registered User
  you are signing up to use our cross platform personalization service. In order to provide you with our service we will combine your Personal
  Information and non-identifying information which you provide to us in connection with your creation and use of your Clover account (e.g., without
  limitation, zip code (on its own), gender and individual preferences and purchase records) to create a profile of your preferences and purchasing
  behavior (collectively a "<strong>User Profile</strong>"). We will use your User Profile to deliver Clover Solution Widgets containing voucher offers based on your
  preferences and purchasing behavior on Clover Partner's websites or online services. Except as explicitly stated herein, Clover will not share the Personal
  Information part of your User Profile with third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Opting Out of Personalization.</strong> As stated above, we use Web Usage Technologies to deliver Clover Solution Widgets based on your inferred
  interests, preferences and purchasing behavior. If you do not want us to collect information about you to customize your experience you can opt-out from
  us doing so in the following ways: </p>

<p>
</p><ul>
  <li><strong>As a Clover Consumer that is not a Register User:</strong> (i) by changing the cookie settings in your browser to stop accepting cookies; or
    (ii) by using our opt-out tool to place our "opt-out cookie" in your browser. You may access the tool by
    <a href="https://www.clover.com/optout" target="_blank">Clicking Here</a>. Thereafter, Clover Solution Widgets may still be served to you on the
    Publisher's websites that you visit, but the delivery of those widgets and the related voucher offers will not be based on your inferred interests.
    Please note that if you delete our opt-out cookie from your browser (e.g. by clearing all cookies from your browser) after you have used the Clover opt-out
    tool, you will need to use the
    tool again to reset our opt-out cookie â the presence of our opt-out cookie is the only way we can tell you do not want have your experience
    customized based on your inferred interests.
  </li>
  <li><strong>As a Registered User</strong>, the advantage of joining the PCN is so you can enjoy our personalization service in order to have Clover
    Solution Widgets delivered to you based on your preferences and purchasing behavior. Similarly, to turn off the personalization service you will need
    to terminate your Clover account. You can do this by following the instructions in the <a href="https://www.clover.com/tos" target="_blank">Clover
      Network Terms of Service Agreement</a>. After you terminate your Clover account, Clover Solution Widgets may still be
    served to you on the Publisher's websites that you visit just like any other non-Registered User, but their delivery will not be based on your
    Personal Information. To opt-out of customization of your experience as a Clover Consumer that is not a Registered User, see the above description
    of the opt-out process.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p><strong>Registered Users</strong>. "<strong>Clover Activity Data</strong>" means your name, expressed buying interests, voucher purchases and the
  comments you post to the PCN through
  use of your Clover account and any other data you have chosen to share publicly or with "friends" per your Entry Point Site account settings. <strong>Your
    Clover Activity Data is only viewable by your Facebook "friends" when they are using the PCN as Registered Users and this information will never be
    broadcast outside of the PCN or on other parts of Facebook without your explicit prior consent.</strong> As a Registered User, you control what
  information about
  you is seen and broadcast to other Registered Users. When you access and use the Clover Solution via an Entry Point Site, subject to the privacy
  settings you've set in your account for the Entry Point Site, your Clover Activity Data will be made available to other Registered Users. For example,
  when you register with Clover via your Facebook account your Clover Activity Data will also include your "likes" and "check-ins" if you have indicated
  in your Facebook account that you wish to share that data. If at any time you wish to change which of your Facebook "friends" see your Clover Activity
  Data, you must change your privacy settings in your Facebook account. When you access and use the PCN directly and not through an Entry Point Site, you
  can also choose what Clover Activity Data is seen by other Registered Users by configuring your "user preferences" in your Clover account. </p>

<p><strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</strong> We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information
  and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other
  purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. </p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our providing the Site and services related to
  the PCN (<i>e.g.</i>, without limitation, maintenance services, database management, payment processing services, web analytics, improvement of the
  PCN's
  features and handling of commercial transactions). These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our
  behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. </p>

<p><strong>Merchants</strong>. We may share your Personal Information with Merchants as necessary for the applicable Merchant to fulfill your voucher
  purchase order. </p>

<p><strong>Entry Point Sites</strong>. As stated above, we may receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance
  with the privacy
  settings you have set in your account with the Entry Point Site, if any. Other than what we may share with the Entry Point Site in connection with your
  linking of accounts, the Personal Information an Entry Point Site has about you is obtained by the Entry Point Site independent of our service. Other
  services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy
  policies or statements of the other websites and online services you visit. </p>

<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong>. Clover cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce
  and comply
  with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion,
  believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of
  Clover or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of
  being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. </p>

<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. Clover may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in
  connection with a
  merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. </p>

<h3>Changing or Deleting Information</h3>

<p>All Registered Users may review, update, or correct the Personal Information in their Clover account by logging into their Clover account. However, if you
  want to make any changes to the information contained in your account on an Entry Point Site, you need to do that through the applicable Entry Point Site.
  You may email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@clover.com">privacy@clover.com</a> with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We
  will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business
  purposes. </p>

<h3><a name="partner"></a>B. CLOVER PARTNERS: PUBLISHERS AND MERCHANTS</h3>

<p>This section of the Privacy Policy applies <i>only</i> to information our Merchants and Publishers (which enter into separate agreements with Clover) may
  provide to
  Clover during their registration with Clover via the Site and in conjunction with their access to and use of the PCN.</p>

<h3>Clover Partner Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features and content, to administer your Clover account, and to enable
  Clover Partners to easily navigate the Site.</p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>. In connection with your use of the PCN, we may ask you for personally identifiable information. This
  refers to
  information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>"). Personal Information includes, but is not
  limited to, your name,
  phone number, Clover account password, bank information, domain address in the case of Publishers for serving Clover Solution Widgets, Federal Tax ID number,
  email address and home and business postal addresses and other personal information listed in the Clover account registration form (collectively, a "<strong>Partner
    Profile</strong>"). We also collect non-identifying information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and
  personalization of your
  Partner Profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences). We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction
  with your non-identifying information) to provide the PCN related services, complete your transactions, administer payments, address your inquiries, and
  contact you regarding Clover account activities or communications relevant to your participation in the PCN. Except as explicitly stated herein, Clover will
  not share the Personal Information part of your Partner Profile with third parties. </p>

<p><strong>Log Data</strong>. When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
  ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log
  Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") address, the geographic location of the IP address you are
  using to access the Internet, browser type, operating system, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our
  Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.
  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and
  user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. </p>

<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</strong>. We use cookies to help us collect, maintain and use information. A cookie is a small data file that we
  transfer to your
  computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site, to enable certain
  features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Clover Partners and web traffic routing on the
  Site. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop
  accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use
  all portions of the Site or all of its functionality. We may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively
  "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>") in combination with cookies in connection with our service to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel
  Tag is an electronic image, which is
  typically a transparent graphic that is placed on a webpage and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have
  visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of our Site's services. </p>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p><strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong>. We may share aggregated information that does not include personally identifiable
  information and we
  may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any
  aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personally identifiable information. </p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Site and services we make available via the PCN, to
  provide such
  services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement
  of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and services are used. These third parties have access to your personally identifiable
  information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. </p>

<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong>. Clover cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and
  comply with the
  law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
  or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Clover or a third party,
  to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or
  legally actionable activity. </p>

<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. Clover may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable
  information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
</p>

<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>

<p>All Clover Partners may review, update, or correct the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging into their Clover account. You may email
  us at <a href="mailto:privacy@clover.com">privacy@clover.com</a> with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use
  commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business
  purposes.</p>

<h3><a name="general"></a>C. GENERAL</h3>

<p>The following provisions apply to Clover Consumers and Clover Partners.
</p>

<h3>Security </h3>

<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
  is 100% secure. When you enter sensitive information (such as password or credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information
  using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. In some cases, we also encrypt or cryptographically hash sensitive information where it is stored on our
  systems.</p>

<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored
  "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most
  expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary
  to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</p>

<h3>International Transfer</h3>

<p>Your information may be transferred to â and maintained on â computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction
  where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information
  to us, Clover transfers personally identifiable information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your
  submission of such information, or your submission of such information to us or your consent to a Publisher to share your information with Clover represents
  your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>The PCN may contain links to other websites or online services, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are a Registered User, your Clover account will be linked to the applicable Entry Point Site.</li>
  <li>A version of the Clover Solution which runs on Entry Point Sites, and third party platforms.</li>
  <li>There may be advertisements served to you within the Site.</li>
  <li>You may be brought to the website of our third party payment processors.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website or online service. The fact that we link to a website or online
  service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or
  information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or online services. These other websites or online services
  may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you. Other sites follow different rules
  regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other
  websites and online services you visit.
</p>

<h3>Phishing</h3>

<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Clover. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity
  theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Clover account ID, login password, or national
  identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade
  Commission's website.</p>

<h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has
  provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@clover.com">
  privacy@clover.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from
  our files. </p>
<h3>Contacting Us </h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@clover.com">privacy@clover.com</a>. </p>
