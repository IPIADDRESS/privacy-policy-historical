        <h3>EU GDPR compliance</h3>
        <h4>What is the GDPR?</h4>
        <p class="smaller">
          The GDPR is a European Union regulation that establishes a new framework for handling and protecting the personal data of EU-based residents. It comes into effect on May 25, 2018. 

        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
          Personal data plays a huge part in society and the economy. It is essential that people have—and know they have—control and clarity over how their data is used and protected by any organization they interact with, and that organizations are given clear guidelines to protect their personal data.
        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
         One of the aims of the GDPR is to harmonize and bring data privacy laws across Europe up to speed with the rapid technological change in the past two decades. It builds upon the current legal framework in the European Union, including the EU Data Protection Directive in existence since 1995. 
        </p>

        <h4>GDPR: How does cloudHQ comply with the GDPR? </h4>


        <p class="smaller">
          The GDPR is consistent with how we think and operate. Our security and privacy policy was already much stronger then any GDPR requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
          cloudHQ already meet the requirements of the GDPR. 
        
          GDPR places an increased focus on documenting decisions and practices affecting personal&nbsp;data: and we consider protecting and locking your personal data very importat. No personal data will even be used, moved, or transferred outside very strict requirements to provide the Service.

        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
        However you should also be working to assess your readiness for the GDPR well in advance of 25 May 2018 which is GDPR enforcement day.
      </p>
        <ul class="smaller">
          <li>
          Trust is the foundation of our relationship with our customers. We value the confidence you’ve put in us and take the responsibility of protecting your information seriously.
          </li>
          <li>
​​            We place the utmost importance on data protection and we have a track record of staying ahead of the compliance curve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our team have carefully analyzed the GDPR and already undertakook the necessary steps to ensure that we comply.
          </li>
          <li>
          cloudHQ includes strong contractual commitments in its
  agreements with our business customers. Our business
  customer agreements incorporate the EU model contract
  clauses and we are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
  Framework. This means there are additional legal protections
  and external monitoring regarding the collection, use, and
  retention of personal data transferred from the European Union
to the United States.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="smaller">Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").</p>
