    <h4>2. How We Use Your Information</h4>

    <p>Contact information such as your email address is used to allow us to smoothly perform certain tasks on your account such as changing or retrieving passwords, to perform sales or business break downs, to provide requested services, to facilitate quality assurance, and to contact you regarding any orders you may have placed with CloudLoad.com. None of your financial information will be released except as legally required by laws, regulations, governmental requests, or judicial orders.

    <h4>3. Use of Cookies and Other Site Tracking Data</h4>

    <p>Cookies - Small files called cookies are placed on your computer's hard drive to assist us in, among other things, providing quicker access to previously visited Service pages or optimizing your Site use. A cookie is also utilized to allow page personalization. Cookies do not contain spyware or malware. Cookies are routinely used to allow CloudLoad.com to ascertain the number of site visitors, which of our web pages are most popular, and length of stay per page. An analysis of this information helps CloudLoad.com to determine which of our Services or features are the most outstanding as well as those which might require revamping. Users may disable cookies by checking or unchecking various preferences or options in their browser. The default position of most browsers is to automatically accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you may be unable to properly utilize the Site or Services.

    Session IDs are unique numbers assigned by a server that allow user identification while the user is traversing multiple web pages. The Session ID may be stored as a cookie, form field, or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Session IDs are helpful in that you arent required to continually re-enter your account name and/or password for each web page that you request. This allows you to surf the pages of CloudLoad's Site more smoothly and quickly. When your internet browser is closed, the Session ID expires.

    CloudLoad.com sometimes embeds special electronic images (gifs) into our web pages that allow gathering of anonymous traffic statistics and/or other combined site visitor information. We, either ourselves or via third party, use gifs to gather information so that we may examine the experience of site visitors and users. We analyze this information to customize future visits and upgrade our Site. To illustrate, we may collect information on browser type (i.e., Windows or Firefox), cookie settings (turned off or on), and words that are used to search for results (what words resulted in the visitor arriving on our Site). We may also collect data on the number of visits, the paths through which a visitor travels the Site, and specific times spent on various pages or sites within CloudLoad.com's purview. All of the information collected by a gif is not person-specific and is only distributed to internal CloudLoad.com staff and our partners if a confidentiality agreement is signed and on file. Information shared with partners is aggregate, not individual, and demonstrates general web site or Internet user interests.

    Your computer's IP address and the web page from which you traveled to our site are recorded every time you enter the Site. In order to properly administer the Site and/or to reveal any Site problems, we utilize your IP address so that you may be identified and your general demographic information be collected.</p>

    <h4>4. Storage of Information</h4>

    <p>You acknowledge that any computer that stores or processes information by CloudLoad.com is based in Canada. When you provide data to CloudLoad.com, you give permission to transfer said information to Canada.</p>

    <h4>5. Information from Other Sites</h4>

    <p>Promotional emails or the websites of CloudLoad.com may contain links to other web sites. These sites may be operated by third parties or other parties. The links may direct the user to web sites that may or may not contain the brand name, trademark, or other intellectual property of CloudLoad.com. When you access other websites via a link provided on CloudLoad.com, even if they do not contain the brand name, trademark, or other intellectual property of CloudLoad.com, be advised that such website content and practices are beyond our control and this privacy policy has no application therein.

Should CloudLoad.com merge, consolidate, or divest or be involved with an acquisition or bankruptcy, your contact information may be given to a third party.</p>

    <h4>7. Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
