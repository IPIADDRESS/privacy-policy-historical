 <blockquote>

 <blockquote>
   <p>We will accept a return of any item that has not been removed from its original packaging.

There is one exception to this policy: The "Close Combat Training" trial program, which you may try for 30 days and return without being responsible for the balance beyond the original shipping cost that you already paid.
