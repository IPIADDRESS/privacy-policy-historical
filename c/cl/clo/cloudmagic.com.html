	            keeps your authentication details and mails in your hard-disk. 
	            It never exchanges Gmail's authentication details and its content with

	            We use and store this data only on a collective basis, in summary form, 
	            rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us to determine how 
	            and the extent to which certain parts of our web site and software are used. 
	            The stored General Statistical Information does not contain any Personal
