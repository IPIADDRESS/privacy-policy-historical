            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask
                    you
                    for personal details for no apparent reason.)
                </li><li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our
                    products, or protect our rights.
                </li><li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one
                    of
                    our services.
                </li><li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the
                    public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
            </li></ul>

            <p>Cloudcraft provides a service for software developers, architects and technical designers to create
                cloud software architectures and systems. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our
                practices regarding the use of
                data that we collect from our website at cloudcraft.co (“Website”) and through our Services. For purpose
                of this Privacy Policy “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, such
                as
                your name, phone number and/or e-mail address.
            </p>

            <h2>User Consent</h2>

            <p>By submitting or making available data through our Website or Services as described below, you agree to
                the
                terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your data in accordance with
                this Privacy Policy. Your data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other
                countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of data may be less stringent
                than
                the laws in your country.</p>


            <h1>(A) What Data We Collect</h1>

            <h2>Information Provided by Visitors</h2>

            <p>If you visit our Website, we may collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name,
                organization
                name, e-mail address and password if you decide to register to receive information or schedule a demo.
                If
                you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted
                on
                our website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the
                e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume.
            </p>

            <h2>Information that We may Collect via Technological Means:</h2>

            <p>Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect data from you, such as
                browser type, operating system, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
                when
                you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for
                your visit. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this data and store it in log files
                each
                time you visit our website or access your account on our network.
            </p>

            <p>We may also use “cookies”, i.e., small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard
                drive while you are viewing a web site. We link the information we store in cookies to the personally
                identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session cookies (which expire
                once
                you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them)
                to
                provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent cookies can be
                removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas
                of
                our website may not work properly. The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates or service providers
                is
                not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third
                parties may use session ID cookies to improve the quality of experience when you interact with our
                products.
                We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.
                This
                allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing
                campaigns. Our Site is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.</p>

            <h2>Information that we may collect from our Customers:</h2>

            <p>If you decide to purchase the Services and become a Cloudcraft customer (“Customer”), we may collect
                additional information from you.
            </p>

            <p>First, we – or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf – will collect Personal
                Data
                including your credit card number or account information.
            </p>

            <p>Second, you’ll be required to set your profile, tell us how to contact your organization when faults are
                detected by the organization’s monitoring tools, and create accounts for the on-call engineers on your
                team.
                You’ll be able to set up your preferred contact methods (e.g., phone, email) and you will be required to
                provide the applicable contact information (“Contact Information”).
            </p>

            <h1>(B) How We Use the Data We Collect</h1>

            <p>We use the Personal Data for two basic purposes: provide and improve the Website and the Services.</p>

            <p>We may also use Personal Data to facilitate the creation of and secure your account on our network;
                identify
                you as a user in our system; provide improved administration of our Website and Services; improve the
                quality of experience when you interact with our Website and Services; detect and address anomalies,
                respond
                to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests; send promotional
                communications;
                provide you with hardcopy or electronic newsletters, or surveys; send upgrades and special offers
                related to
                our Services and related services and for other marketing purposes of Cloudcraft, should you request to
                receive such communications from us; make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of
                secondary
                fraud protection or to solicit your feedback.</p>

            <p>We may also analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of the Website and
                Services
                or improve their respective functionalities, or for other business purposes.</p>

            <h1>(C) When We May Disclose Data</h1>

            <p>We may share your data with third parties to provide technical support or to provide specific services,
                such
                as hosting and payment processing.</p>

            <p>Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Cloudcraft may
                disclose
                Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant
                laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Cloudcraft; or (b) protect or defend the rights or
                property of Cloudcraft or users of the Services or related services.</p>

            <p>We may also share any information collected under this Privacy Policy with any of our affiliates, or in
                connection with any merger, sale of assets, financing, acquisition, or in any other situation where used
                information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.</p>

            <p>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data
                collected
                from our services to third parties other than as outlined in this policy. You expressly consent to the
                sharing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h1>Your Choices</h1>

            <p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data.</p>

            <h2>Opt-Out</h2>

            <p>We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or
                the
                purchase of our Services or services. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from
                us,
                you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the
                opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your account or by following the unsubscribe instructions
                provided
                in the e-mail you receive). Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any
                updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy or other communications that are necessary to
                administer
                your account (e.g., for billing purposes).</p>

            <h2>Ability to Edit or Delete Personal Information</h2>

            <p>You may edit any of your Personal Data in your account, including Contact Information (and/or
                notification

                associated with Personal Data and mistakes and security breaches may happen. If you have any questions

            <h1>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes in the way
                we

                our site, or the date that you accept the changes (e.g., by clicking an “I Accept” button or similar
                means).

                valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of
                the
                e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in
