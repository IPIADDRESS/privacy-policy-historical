    <div id="body-content"><div id="content"><!-- CONTENT CONTROL START --><h1 class="h-2">Active.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Effective date:  September 15, 2011</h3>
<p>The Active Network, Inc. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries (collectively, “Active,” “we” or “our”) value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.&nbsp; Active is the leading provider of organization-based cloud computing applications.&nbsp; Our technology platform, ActiveWorks®, transforms the way organizers manage their activities and events by automating online registrations and streamlining other critical management functions, while also driving consumer participation to their events.&nbsp; Our flagship property, Active.com®, is an online community for people who want to discover, participate in, and share activities about which they are passionate.&nbsp; On Active.com, you’ll be able to learn about upcoming sporting events, and, in some circumstances, to register for those events and tell your friends about the events. </p>
<p>You also can learn about events in your area, register for races, and enjoy many of the benefits of our websites through our mobile applications (examples include the Active.com and Couch-to-5k applications) (collectively, “Applications”).&nbsp; In general, our Applications operate on an open network; that means that any information that you post to these Applications may be available to other users of the same application, and, in some instances the Active.com website.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe the information that we collect from visitors to our websites.&nbsp; Unless expressly noted otherwise, this Policy applies to all of the websites (“Sites”) owned or operated by Active; our blogs; our Applications and our online products and services (collectively, “Services”).&nbsp; By visiting our Sites or using any of our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy, which is incorporated by reference into the Active Terms of Service, available at <a href="http://www.activenetwork.com/information/terms-of-use.htm">http://www.activenetwork.com/information/terms-of-use.htm</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?</strong><br>We may collect information about both businesses and individuals.&nbsp; The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites; use our Applications; register for events, activities, or contests (collectively, “Events”); and allows us to provide our Services to you.&nbsp; We also use this information to personalize and continually improve our Sites and Services.&nbsp; Generally, we collect information about you directly from you or your use of our Services, but in some cases we may collect information about you from third parties, such as the sponsor of a particular Event for which you might have registered.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect Directly From You </em></strong><br><em>Account Information for our Sites.</em>&nbsp; You may browse our Sites without creating an online account, but to use certain features, you must create an account.&nbsp; When you create an account with us, we may collect the following:</p>
<ul class="green">
<li>Your first and last name</li>
<li>Your email address and your desired password</li>
<li>Your display name (this is the name other people will see when you post items to one of our Sites or engage in other similar activities on our site)</li>
<li>Your date of birth</li>
<li>Your subscription preferences (whether and what types of information you would like us to send you)</li>
<li>Information about your activities and interests </li>
<li>Other profile data, such as contact information, occupation, gender, and photo &nbsp;</li>
<li>Payment information (if applicable)</li></ul>
<p>Once you have signed up for a particular Active website, on subsequent visits, you will simply enter your email address and password for that website.&nbsp; In the future, you may be able to use a single log in for all Active websites.</p>
<p><em>Log in and Location Information for our Mobile Applications</em>.&nbsp; When you first visit any of our mobile Applications, you will enter your user ID and your password that you use for the service through which you downloaded the Application.&nbsp; You will have the option of creating a user ID and password for subsequent visits to our Applications.&nbsp; When you log into certain of our Applications, we will request your permission to obtain your current location (so-called “geolocation” information) so that we can identify Events near you.&nbsp; In the “settings” function on your phone, you also will have the ability to manually request that we record your geolocation information for certain Applications or features of Applications, for example, so that we can track your running route.&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>Events and Training Information.</em>&nbsp; As a member of our Sites, you may post information about upcoming Events.&nbsp; We will collect the information that you enter about the Event.&nbsp; We also may collect information from you if you choose to register for an Event on our Sites as a participant or record your training activity.&nbsp; For some events, you may register directly on the Active.com website and through our Applications; for other Events, we may provide a link that directs you to the sponsor or holder of the Event.&nbsp; The information that we collect about you may vary based on the Event, but generally includes the same type of information that you would include when creating an account with us.&nbsp; In addition, we may collect your race chip ID.&nbsp; If there is a charge to enter the Event, we may collect your credit card billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, billing and shipping address, and other information necessary to process your payment. </p>
<p><em>Charitable Events.</em>&nbsp; You may create a page on certain of our Sites to collect donations for (i) your participation in a charity event (e.g., you want to raise money for running in a marathon), (ii) a particular charity, or (iii) for other purposes.&nbsp; We may collect information from you surrounding the charitable event or your request for donations.&nbsp; In addition, if you donate to a particular Event/cause, we may collect your name, contact information and credit card information.&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>Contests, Surveys and Questionnaires.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></em>When you sign up for contests, or complete questionnaires or surveys, we collect the information you submit to us.&nbsp; We use this information to administer the contest or survey, to analyze the results, for research purposes, to send you other information or offers we think may be of interest to you, to comply with legal requirements, and for other purposes as discussed in this Policy. </p>
<p><em>User Comments and Posts</em>.&nbsp; Our Sites and Applications may allow users to post content, such as comments, blogs, and messages.&nbsp; If you post content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information.&nbsp; You should also note that such information may be viewed by other members and public visitors to our Sites.&nbsp; Therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy in the information you post to the Sites.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect from Facebook</em></strong> <br>We also may provide you with the opportunity to connect via Facebook, through Active.com or our Applications.&nbsp; For example, you can note that you are going to participate in an Event and invite your Facebook friends to join that Event.&nbsp; If you log into Facebook through Active.com or our Applications, we will request permission to (i) access your basic information, which includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, Facebook user ID, list of friends, and any other information that you have made public on Facebook; and (ii) manage your events (so that Active may RSVP on your behalf).&nbsp; For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it.&nbsp; We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect About You From Third Parties</em></strong> <br>We also may collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you from our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.&nbsp; For example, where permitted by law, we may share information we collect about you among affiliates to identify products and services that we believe might be of interest to you.&nbsp; As another example, if you register for a race by clicking through our Sites, we may obtain your name and contact information from the sponsor of the race; when the race is over, we also may obtain your race time.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></strong>&nbsp; <br>We may use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you when you visit our Sites and receive emails from us.&nbsp; Specifically, we may collect the following information about your use of our Sites via these technologies:&nbsp; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; your interaction with the Sites; length of time you are logged in to our Sites; and websites visited before our Sites.&nbsp; Please see the section “What About Cookies and Other Tracking Devices” below for more information about our use of cookies.&nbsp; We may use the information gathered through these methods in anonymous or aggregated form to analyze ways to improve our Sites or services.&nbsp; This information also is associated with your username and may be combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you. </p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use Your Information?</strong><br>We use the information that we gather about you for the following purposes:&nbsp; </p>
<ul class="green">

<li><strong><em>Affiliates</em></strong><em>.</em>&nbsp; We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your information will be subject to this Policy.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong><em>Event Sponsors or Partners</em></strong><em>.&nbsp; </em>If you are using our Services to register for an Event or to purchase a third party product or service, Active shares the personal information you provide with any applicable third parties in order to fulfill your request.&nbsp; You may receive emails or direct mail from these entities; each such party operates independently from Active and maintains its own privacy policy. </li>
<li><strong><em>Service Providers</em></strong>.&nbsp; We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf.&nbsp; For example, these providers may help us administer our Sites and Applications or manage and administer Events.&nbsp; These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of information, and to only use such information for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong><em>Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties</em></strong>.&nbsp; We may disclose the information that we collect about you to non-affiliated third parties, such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships.&nbsp; Those third parties may use your information for marketing purposes, such as to market products and services that they believe would be of interest to you.&nbsp; We also may combine the information that we collect about you with other information that we obtain from third parties.&nbsp; This information may help us to determine what advertisements to direct to you, to place on our website, and where to advertise our Services.&nbsp; As discussed in the advertising section below, you have the right to opt out of certain uses of your information.&nbsp; You also have the ability to opt-into the receipt of certain information from us and non-affiliated third parties.&nbsp; We may share your information to respond to your choices.&nbsp; </li></ul>

<li><strong><em>Aggregate and Anonymized Information</em></strong>.&nbsp; We may share aggregate or anonymized information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.&nbsp; For example, if we display advertisements on behalf of a third party, we may share aggregate, demographic information with that third party about the users to whom we displayed the advertisements.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p><strong>What About Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?</strong><br>When you interact with the Sites and our Applications, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful.&nbsp; We or our third party service providers use cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and similar technologies to track user activity and collect website and Application data.&nbsp; We may combine this data with the personal information we have collected from you. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>.&nbsp; Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes.&nbsp; We and our third party service providers may use “cookies” on our Sites to, among other things, better serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites.&nbsp; There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies. In addition, we also allow vendors to use cookies on our Sites. </p>
<ul class="green">
<li><u>Session Cookies</u>.&nbsp; Session cookies exist only during an online session.&nbsp; They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.&nbsp; We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Sites.&nbsp; This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites.&nbsp; </li>
<li><u>Persistent Cookies</u>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.&nbsp; We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information. </li>
<li><u>Third Party Cookies</u><em>.</em> We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable website data and to serve advertisements.&nbsp; To do so, we may permit third parties to apply cookies to users of our Sites, where permitted by law, and, subject to your right to opt-out through the Network Advertising Initiative and About Ads (as discussed below).&nbsp; We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Sites and to analyze site usage.&nbsp; Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.&nbsp; These third parties are required to use your information in accordance with this Policy. </li></ul>
<p><em>Disabling Cookies</em>. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future.&nbsp; The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. &nbsp;Visitors to our Sites who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Sites; however, many site features, such as the shopping cart, will not function if you disable cookies. </p>
<p><strong>Local Storage Objects</strong>.&nbsp; We and our third party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit or to display content based upon what you view on our Site.&nbsp; Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.&nbsp; In addition, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser.&nbsp; For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">Adobe Flash Player Help Page</a>, choose “<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Panel”</a> and follow the instructions.&nbsp; To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO. </p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies</strong>.&nbsp; We use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. &nbsp;We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Sites to, among other things, track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage.&nbsp; We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed and track whether our e-mails are forwarded. </p>
<p><strong>Site Analytics</strong>.&nbsp; As noted, Active works with third party service providers who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Sites.&nbsp; For example, we use a variety of third party web analytics, to help us improve our Sites’ performance and user experiences.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks</strong>.&nbsp; We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Sites.&nbsp; Please see the section entitled “Advertising” for additional information about our practices and your choices with regard to receiving such advertisements.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Third Party Applications</strong><br>Third party applications may be available on our Sites.&nbsp; The owners or providers of those third party applications may collect personally identifiable information from you.&nbsp; Their collection of information is bound by their own information collection policies and practices.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by third parties.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Advertisements</strong><br>We display advertisements on our Sites.&nbsp; Some of the advertisements are based on the collection of personal information and others are based on the collection of aggregate information.&nbsp; Please see the bottom of this section for opt-out information.</p>
<p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Sites.&nbsp; Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited.&nbsp; This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.&nbsp; Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.&nbsp; These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.&nbsp; We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Sites and our Services, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks.&nbsp; The website <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI members. </strong>&nbsp;You also may contact About Ads at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> for information about opting out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members.&nbsp; Opting out of one or more NAI members or About Ad members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Sites or other websites. &nbsp;You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.&nbsp; Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or About Ad opt-out may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and About Ad’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content</strong><br>As stated above, any information that you post to our Sites or our Applications may be viewable by other Active users, as well as visitors to our Sites and Applications.&nbsp; Active is not responsible for the privacy of any information that you choose to post to our Sites, such as a blog, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings.&nbsp; Any information that you disclose becomes public information.&nbsp; We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Links</strong><br>At times, our Sites and Applications may contain links to other third party websites.&nbsp; Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but, instead, is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites, and we are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong><br>We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection, encryption, and SSL to protect our Sites and the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.&nbsp; Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your password private.&nbsp; You should never share your log-in information with others.&nbsp; We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.&nbsp; More information on Active’s security can be found at: <a href="http://www.activenetwork.com/security.htm">http://www.activenetwork.com/security.htm</a>.</p>
