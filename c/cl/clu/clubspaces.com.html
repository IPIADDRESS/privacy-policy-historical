                                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> <p> </p> <p>Clubspaces, Inc. (“Clubspaces”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting Clubspaces’s Web site, or using any of our products or services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>What does this privacy policy cover?</strong></p> <p>This Privacy Policy covers Clubspaces’ treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Clubspaces gathers when you are accessing the Clubspaces Web site and when you use Clubspaces products or services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Clubspaces does not own or control, or to individuals that Clubspaces does not employ or manage.</p> <p><strong>What information does Clubspaces collect?</strong></p> <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to offer our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</p> <p>Clubspaces collects personal information that you provide when you register with us, use Clubspaces' products or services available on the Clubspaces site (the "Service") or post content on a Clubspace as a guest with administrative privileges and rights.</p> <p>Clubspaces may also collect personal information you provide to us when you enter any promotions or sweepstakes offered on the Clubspaces site.</p> <p>Clubspaces may aggregate your information with information from other users (without personally identifying you) and share it with our business partners or others.</p> <p>Clubspaces may also collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. This information might include information necessary to process payments due to us from you such as your credit card number.</p> <p>Clubspaces automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you request.</p> <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p> <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in any other way. The types of information collected include, but are not limited to, your name, email address, postal code, country, phone number, and credit card information if appropriate. You may also enter and upload information and data about your club or organization, including digital pictures and images, audio and video files, online documents and text, spreadsheets and other information about members of your organization in different formats and mediums. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of our full offering of services. The information you provide is used for such purposes as managing your account and allowing you to utilize and provide services to your club or organization and for Clubspaces and its partner's marketing and advertising messaging and targeting.</p> <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p> <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Web site or the Clubspaces service. Clubspaces automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address and the page you requested. If you are a subscriber to the Clubspaces service, our system maintains server logs on the quantity of transferred data for each user.</p> <p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Clubspaces only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Web site or services so that we can make the Web site appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners, including our advertisers and sponsors, about how our customers, collectively, use our site. Again, Clubspaces never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p> <p>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Clubspaces will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</p> <p><strong>What about Cookies?</strong></p> <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable certain features of our service. It is required for subscribers that cookies be allowed while logged in to the Clubspaces service.</p> <p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p> <p>* A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive.</p> <p>* You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set, however, if you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use Clubspaces products or services that require you to "sign in" and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on the Clubspaces site.</p>
* Clubspaces uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:<br> <ul> <li>Require you to re-enter your Clubspaces password after a certain period of time has lapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.</li> <li>Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Clubspaces' services.</li> <li>Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.</li> <li>Conduct research to improve Clubspaces' content and services.</li> </ul> <p>* Clubspaces lets other entities that show advertisements on some of our web pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this policy. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Clubspaces' cookies.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Will Clubspaces share any of the personal information it receives?</strong></p> <p>We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only with our affiliates, as required, to deliver you services as described below.</p> <p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We are affiliated with certain businesses and work closely with them. Normally, you can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share customer information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</p> <p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders/ delivering packages/sending postal mail/sending email/removing repetitive information from customer lists/analyzing data/providing marketing assistance/processing credit card payments/and providing customer service. Unless we tell you differently, Clubspaces’ agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information for the above purposes.</p> <p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Clubspaces, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Clubspaces goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Clubspaces may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. </p> <p>Protection of Clubspaces and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Clubspaces, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p> <p>Third Party Advertising: Advertisements appearing on Clubspaces may be delivered to users by Clubspaces or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, advertising partners (or "ad networks") may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Clubspaces and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p> <p>Clubspaces does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers. Clubspaces may share general demographic information (such as information about members' aggregate interests and occupations) and non-personally identifiable information (such as browser type and IP addresses) with advertisers and partners). Clubspaces may share your voluntarily-provided public information (such as gender, age, geographic region) with advertisers for the purposes of relevant ad targeting.</p> <p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p> <p><strong>Our Commitment to Data Security</strong></p> <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.<br> <br>
Your Clubspaces account personal information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p> <p><strong>How to Access or Correct Personal Information</strong></p> <p>Clubspaces allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing and, in certain situations, updating that information. This list will change as our Web site changes. The information you may access and update includes user name, password, computer names, and address books and, if you subscribe to premium services, your billing address, billing credit card, service type, and billing frequency. You may change any of these items (except address book) by going to 'Manage Account' in the subscriber portion of the Clubspaces website. To change your address book, go to the sharing page to add or delete addresses.</p> <p><strong>What choices do I have?</strong></p> <p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information to us, even though it may be needed to subscribe to services or take advantage of certain Clubspaces features.</p> <p>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the 'How To Access or Correct Personal Information' section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. </p> <p>You may request deletion of your Clubspaces account by sending an email to feedback@clubspaces.com.</p> <p>If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please send an email to feedback@clubspaces.com.

Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used or collected. If we make changes in the way we use personal information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Web site.   </p> <p><strong>Questions or Concerns</strong></p> <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at Clubspaces site, please send a detailed message to <a href="mailto:feedback@clubspaces.com">feedback@clubspaces.com</a>.
