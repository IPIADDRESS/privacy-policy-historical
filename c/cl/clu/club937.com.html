Thanks for checking out my bio, even if you just accidentally clicked over here. My name is AJ, real name is Jenny. AJ stands for \"And Jenny\" because, at our first radio station, there was already a \"Jenny\" on staff. So I had to come up with something different.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Contrary to stereotypes, I don't drink beer and I'm not a Packers fan. I never planned on getting into radio; I was big into theater and sports as a kid. Although I loved making my own radio shows on my double-decker boom box, so I guess it was meant to be. I used to be an Irish dancer, and I also had my own Irish dance school back in Wisconsin. I'm have a younger sister, so I'm great at compromise. Married to Pat, have an 10-year-old son who's on the autism spectrum. Our house is a small zoo: dog, 2 cats, a bird, a snake and a fish. I'm easy-going; probably TOO much. I turn into a doormat. So if you need something from me, I'll probably do it. Just don't ask me to clean your house. I live with two boys; I'm tired of cleaning.\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting and thanks for listening!","thumbnail":"http://wcrz.com/files/2017/07/AJ.jpg","url":"http://club937.com/author/jclark/"}]},"alternateData":{"_townsquare_media_url":"","dynamic-lead-video":"0","ts3_alternate":{"title":"","excerpt":"","link-url":"","image":""},"_aioseop_title":"Flint&apos;s
