              Thank you for visiting our site at www.clubtexting.com ("Web Site"). 
                Your privacy is important to us and we provide this notice 
                explaining our online information practices and the choices you can 
                make about the collection and use of the personal information you 
                submit at this site. This policy applies only to Club Texting`s 
                treatment of personally identifiable information collected through

                If you are visiting our site from outside the United States, please 
                be advised that because we operate internationally, and certain of 
                our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your 
                personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data 
                protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of 
                protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European 
                Union. By using the Web Site, you consent to any such transfer of 
                information outside of your country, and you also consent to Club 
                Texting using your personal information to contact you 
                electronically, in writing, or otherwise to provide notices relating 
                to your use of the Web Site and to give you information about the 
                products and services offered by Club Texting and its affiliates. 
                Club Texting may store your information beyond this date if that is 
                required by law or contract.<br>

                Web Site Visitors</span><br>
              We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when 
                you visit many of our Web pages, such as the type of browser you are 
                using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating 
                system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS), and the domain 
                name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, 
                Earthlink).<br>
                <br>
                  <span class="titles2">Web Site Customers</span><br>
                In order to purchase products or services from Club Texting, we 
                    require that you provide us with certain personally identifiable 
                    information (please see Section 3 of our Terms of Service for 
                    additional details). The types of personally identifiable 
                    information that may be collected at this site include: name, 
                    address, e-mail address, cell phone number and MSISDN (mobile 
                    station integrated services digital network number), credit card and 
                    billing information, download history, customer generated content 
                    and/or information about your interests in and use of various 
                    products, programs, and services.<br>
              <br>
              We may use such personally identifiable information to provide the 
                information or content you have requested (e.g., fulfill your orders 
                for our ringtones, games, data and news), to contact you about 
                programs, products, features or services in which we believe you may 
                be interested (such as future promotional materials), or for other 
                purposes disclosed from time to time. We also may use your 
                personally identifiable information to contact you regarding your 
                use of our Web Site or changes to our privacy notice, Terms of 
                Service, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of 
                our Web Site. In addition, we may use information collected about 
                our users to improve the content and navigation of our Web Site, or 
                for other internal purposes.<br>
                <br>
                We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect 
                from you with outside records (e.g., information we obtain from 
                other companies, including wireless providers) to enhance our 
                ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you 
                opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may 
                be of interest to you.<br>
                <br>
                To fulfill your requests for products and services (e.g., provide 
                you with content via your cell phone), we may share the personally 
                identifiable information you provide with your cell phone service 
                provider or their partner and subcontractor companies. Our privacy 
                policy does not cover such entities use of information. To learn 
                more about your providerâ€™s privacy practices, you should consult its 
                privacy policy. From time to time, we may share personally 
                identifiable information with unrelated third parties to enable them 
                to provide you with opportunities to learn of products or services 
                in which you may be interested.<br>
                <br>
                We may also disclose anonymous, aggregated user statistics to third 
                parties for a variety of purposes. For example, we may disclose how 
                many individuals visited certain areas of our Web Site or purchased 
                a particular type of product.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, we may disclose personally identifiable information 
                collected about you at this site in the following instances:<br>
                <br>
                    <span class="titles2">Legal Action:</span> We may disclose information about our users, including

                      hearing or the like, to verify or enforce compliance with the 
                      policies governing our Web Site and applicable laws, or to protect 
                      against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site. We also may 
                      disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is 
                      necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our 
                      rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of 
                      our users.<br>
