<p><strong>4. Cookies</strong><br>
          To enhance your experience with the Website, we  use "cookies" on  our Website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your  computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser and to provide features. Cookies, by themselves, do not  tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless  you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at  our Website. However, once you become a customer and furnish the Website with  personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data  stored in the cookie.</p>
<p><br>
          We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve  the content and offerings on our Website. For example, we may use cookies to  personalize your experience at our Website (e.g., to recognize you when you  return to the Website). With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from  your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a  cookie is stored. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser  for more information. However, certain areas of the Website can be accessed  only in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware  that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some  of our content.</p>
      <p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, and service providers is not covered by our privacy  statement.&nbsp; We do/do not have access or  control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, and service providers use session ID cookies to allow us to improve site navigation and usage.</p>
<p><strong>5. Web Beacons</strong><br>
          Our third party  advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site  by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp;  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web  users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are  stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on  Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We  do not tie  the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally  identifiable information. </p>

<p><strong>10. Links to Other Websites </strong><br>
          The Website may contain links to third party websites, whose information  practices may be different than Club Texting’s. Visitors should consult such  third-party sites’ privacy notices as Club Texting does not have any control over  information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.&nbsp;  Club Texting does not make any representations or warranties as to the security  of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other  personal information) you might be requested to give any third party.&nbsp; <br>
        </p>
      <p>These links are provided solely as a convenience to you  and not as an endorsement by Club Texting of the contents on such third-party  websites.&nbsp; Club Texting cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any  products or services that you purchase from a third-party site that links to or  from the Website, since these sites are owned and operated by independent  retailers.<br>
        </p>
      <p>Club Texting is not responsible for the content of linked  third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content  or accuracy of materials on such third-party sites.&nbsp; Club Texting has not  taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the  information contained in such third-party sites.&nbsp; If you decide to access  linked third-party sites, you do so at you own risk. Club Texting strongly  encourages you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate  before proceeding with any online or off-line transaction with any of these  third parties. </p>
<p><strong>11. Data Security </strong><br>
          The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information  associated with visitors to the Website—as well as Club Texting customer  information, such as cell phone numbers, texts, messages and other account  data—is of utmost concern to Club Texting, and we have implemented, and  periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Unfortunately, due  to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that  communications between you and Club Texting will be free from unauthorized access  by third parties. Visitors of the Website and Club Texting customers use the  Website at their own risk.</p>
<p><strong>12. Your Acceptance of These Terms </strong><br>
          By accessing the Website, you signify your assent to the Club Texting Privacy  Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the  Website. You should visit this page periodically, as we may, from time to time,  update this Privacy Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately  upon posting on the Website and without further notice to you.&nbsp; Your  continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to this  Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you.&nbsp; Club  Texting will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in  accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information  was collected. </p>
<p><strong>13. Changes in This Privacy Policy</strong><br>
          We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to  our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you  by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of  a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
