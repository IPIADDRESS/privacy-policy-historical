We may also use this data to conduct statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data.</p>

			<h2>Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs</h2>
			
			<p>Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs, also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs, are transparent graphical images placed on a website. We use these items on its Website for reasons similar to those described above in the Cookies section.</p>

In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy for more information about this Act), we will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from our files to the extent technologically possible.</p>
