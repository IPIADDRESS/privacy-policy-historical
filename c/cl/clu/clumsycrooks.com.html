      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We respect your privacy, 
        and we want you to feel comfortable using our website. Therefore, we are 
        providing you with this privacy policy so you can better understand how 
        we collect information about you, what we do with your information, and 
        who, other than CyberClicks, Inc. ("TellSrv.com, ClumsyCrooks.com, 
        411-Find.com, and DaveDaily.com"), may also receive your information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Use of Customer Information</u></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once we obtain your Customer 
        Information, it is added to a list of other information we have obtained 
        from other customers and patrons (the "Customer List"). Occasionally 
        we may provide the Customer List to trusted third parties who we believe 
        can provide you with products, benefits or services that might be of interest 
        to you.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On occasion, we may hire third 
        parties to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling 
        orders, delivering packages, removing repetitive information from the 
        Customer List, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing 
        credit card payments, and providing customer service. These third parties 
        have access to your Customer Information to the extent necessary to permit 
        them to do their jobs, however, they may not use it for other purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also may disclose your Customer 
        Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe 
        that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal 
        process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against 
        misuse or unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal 
        safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this 
        means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone 
        else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation 
        into your actions). </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, we may use the 
        information we obtain from our customers in the aggregate to determine 
        our customers' demographics and preferences. By doing so, we are able 
        to deliver targeted advertisements on our website which you may find to 
        be helpful and informative.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other than as stated in this 
        Privacy Policy, we will not release your Customer Information to unknown 
        or unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference your Customer 
        Information with that of any other customer or entity.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you sign up as our customer 
        (use our website), you will be provided with an opportunity to receive 
        information from various companies that advertise on our website (collectively, 
        "Third Party Companies" or, individually, a "Third Party 
        Company"). In order to receive information from Third Party Companies, 
        you must check the box next to the advertiser from whom you wish to receive 
        additional information. By checking the box, your Customer information 
        will be sent to that Third Party Company, and you will receive correspondence 
        directly from that Third Party Company. CyberClicks, Inc does not warrant 
        or guaranty the statements, products or services provided by any of the

        with any additional information about yourself.</font></p>
