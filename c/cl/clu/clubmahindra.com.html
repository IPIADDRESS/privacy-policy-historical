If you have further questions relating to this policy please contact our <span class="impDetail">Privacy Officer</span> by mail at <span class="impDetail">Mahindra Towers, 2nd Floor, 17/18 Patullos Road, Anna Salai, Chennai - 600002, India</span> or e-mail <a href="mailto:feedback@clubmahindra.com" title="mailto:feedback@clubmahindra.com" class="readMore smallFontAll">feedback@clubmahindra.com</a>.</p>

							    <li>Collecting information about you
								<p>In accordance with the Privacy Act, MHRIL only collects personal information that is necessary for business purposes. We endeavour at all times to collect personal information in a fair and lawful manner, and to meet our members' expectations that we will respect their right to control how their personal information is collected and used.</p>
								<p>MHRIL collects personal information in many parts of its business. These include:</p>
								<ul class="unnumberedList">
								    <li>MHRIL Exchange and MHRIL Points: MHRIL collects information about members at the time when a person first joins a program and while a person is a member. The main categories of information we collect relate to a person's general contact information, personal details such as age range and gender, use of the program, payment details, responses to surveys and other details, which are usually collected directly from the member.</li>
								    <li>MHRIL Resort Management: In its role of managing some resorts, MHRIL collects personal information related to bookings and as necessary for other purposes related to the management of the resort facility. Further personal information may be collected in specific instances such as in the event of an incident occurring on site for legal and insurance reasons.</li>
								    <li>MHRIL collects information on individuals when they book their travel arrangements, in order to process the transaction and to fulfil booking requests with travel and tourism operators.</li>
								    <li>MHRIL also collects general business information relating to employees, contractors, shareholders, resort managers and other individuals.ï¿½</li>
								    <li>This policy explains the main features of MHRILs use of member and customer information and does not outline in detail the use of contractor and employee information. Under the Privacy Act, there is a general exemption from the coverage of employee records.</li>
								</ul>
							    </li>
							    <li>Using and disclosing your personal information
								<p>Our purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you with membership services, such as exchanging your holiday accommodation entitlements. MHRIL uses personal information in several different ways in operating our membership programs and operating our business, and most of these uses are clear from the circumstances. We also use your personal information for internal quality assurance purposes.</p>
								<p>MHRIL provides personal information to resort operators in order to facilitate a booking that you have requested. Otherwise MHRIL does not routinely disclose personal information, except where it is necessary to provide you with a service that you have requested such as to make bookings for your travel with airlines. MHRIL will not normally otherwise use or disclose any information about you without your consent, unless:</p>
								<ul class="unnumberedList">
								    <li>required by law</li>
								    <li>to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another MHRIL member, any member of the public.</li>
								    <li>the assets and operations of the business are transferred to another party as a going concern.ï¿½ </li>
								    <li>When you provide your personal information to us, MHRIL will give you the choice as to whether or not you wish to receive further information about special offers, promotions, and changes to our products and services. If you indicate that you do not wish to receive these, we will not contact you further for these purposes. Please allow 28 days for your request to be processed.</li>
								</ul>
							    </li>
							    <li>Service providers
								<p>Like many businesses, MHRIL uses a range of service providers to help us maximise the quality and efficiency of our services and our business operations. This means that individuals and organizations outside of MHRIL, such as mail houses, will sometimes have access to personal information held by MHRIL and may use it on behalf of MHRIL. We require our service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it for any unauthorised purposes</p>
							    </li>
							    <li>MHRIL and marketing activities
								<p> MHRIL manages communications with members, prospective members and customers according to its privacy policy. We respect individuals choices about being contacted for marketing purposes. We may occasionally contact you at the e-mail or other address that you provide to us in order to:</p>

								    <li>Remind you of your membership renewal or warn you of the upcoming expiry of membership benefits.</li>
								    <li>Provide you with updated information about our services or special promotions.</li>
								    <li>Provide you with other information about other products and services which you may have an interest in.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Some of this information is necessary as part of our communication about the MHRIL program and is sent to all members.
