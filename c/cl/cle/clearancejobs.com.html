<p>We at Dice, ClearanceJobs and
Targeted Job Fairs (collectively, “Dice”) are committed to good privacy
practices regarding your personal information. Your loyalty as a job seeker,
customer or visitor is important, and we hope that our concerns regarding your
privacy, as described in this policy (the "Privacy Policy" or
"Policy"), demonstrate our commitment to making your experience with
Dice an enjoyable and satisfying one. 

</p>
<p>Although Dice respects the privacy
of all those who visit our Web sites and use our online services, we do collect
information from our visitors, including job seekers and customers. This Privacy
Policy governs your interaction with the Dice web site and your registration for
and use of Dice's online services (collectively, the "Services").
Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="/index.php?action=legal">Terms
of Use</a> and other published guidelines, we do not release personally
identifiable information about our members and visitors without their
permission.

</p>
<p>Note that, by using the Services,
you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this
Policy, please do not use the Services. Your continued use of the Services
subsequent to changes to this Policy will mean that you accept the changes;
therefore, please bookmark this page and review it periodically. If you have any
questions regarding this Privacy Policy, or any other privacy issues in
connection with the Services, please e-mail us at <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.

</p>
<p>
<b>A. The information we gather</b>.

</p>
<p>Dice gathers two types of
information about users:

</p>
<p>1. <b>Non-personally identifiable
information (information that does not identify a specific individual)</b>: When
visitors use the Services, we collect and aggregate information indicating,
among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were
visited, and which links were "clicked." Collecting such information
involves the collection and logging of IP addresses, operating system, and
browser software used by each user of the Services. Although such information is
not personally identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor's
Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of
connectivity.

</p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable
information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of our web site
and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we
may disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them of the
number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their advertisements.

</p>
<p>We collect non-personally
identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" - that
is, small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - that help us
determine the type of content and pages to which you link, the length of time
you spend at any particular area of the Services, and the Services you choose to
use. Cookies also tell us which advertisements you have seen on our Services,
allowing us to continue to provide many of these Services at little or no cost
to you. Essentially, cookies are your identification cards for the Dice
computers or servers that placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server
that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus; they will not
permit a Web site operator to learn any personally identifiable information (see
below) about you unless you have previously provided that information to the Web
site operator or you have set the preferences in your browser to provide this
information.

</p>
<p>Cookies allow Dice to serve you
better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience with the
Services - for example, by allowing us to save your password so that you do not
have to reenter it each time you use the Services. Nevertheless, you should be
able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser.
For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation
accompanying your browser.

</p>
<p>Dice uses pixels, or transparent GIF
files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad
management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a
unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which
advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by
another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight
technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not
personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone
number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including
information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>.


</p>
<p>Please note that our advertisers and
their designees, as well as other third parties, may collect information about
you through cookies or other technologies when they serve advertisements through
the Services or when you visit their Web site(s). Additionally, the Services
contain links to other third party Web sites, including co-branded or other
affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction
with Dice. You acknowledge that we do not monitor or control the information
collection or privacy practices of any third parties, and are not responsible
for their practices or the content of their web sites, including their use of
any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected
when visitors or Members "click through" links to their sites or view
advertisements served by them. Even though certain information collected by such
third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to
become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties
if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.

</p>
<p><b>2. Personally identifiable
information</b>: In certain areas of the Services - such as those in which you
Announce Availability, complete a profile, submit your résumé, create a new
account, or enter Dice-sponsored contests or promotions - we may request that
you provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as your
e-mail address, name, zip code, profession, or work experience. We will, in such
situations, seek to identify which informational items are required and which
are optional.

</p>
<p>Job seekers should post profiles and
resumes on Dice only if they wish such information to be viewed by Dice's
customers. At any time, job seekers may elect that their profile and resume not
be searchable by Dice's customers by logging into their account and changing the
status of their profile or, if that is not possible, they may contact Dice at <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:support@dice.com">support@dice.com</a>
and we will make the change for them.

</p>
<p>In addition, job seekers may elect
to make their profile searchable by Dice customers on a confidential basis only.
In this case, the user's name, contact information and resume will not be
displayed to customers performing searches on Dice. If the customer desires to
contact the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, they
will send an email to the job seeker through the Dice system. Dice will forward
the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not be
provided directly to the customer. 

</p>
<p><i>The Services are not available to
children under 13 years of age</i>. We do not knowingly collect personally
identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.

</p>
<p>Please note that Dice cannot control
the acts of users of the Services. All members and visitors should be aware
that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a resume or
profile or other medium, the information may be collected and used by others to
send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside Dice. In the event
that you encounter any Dice user who is improperly collecting or using
information about you or other users, please contact <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.

</p>
<p><b>B. How we use (and do not use)
the information we gather</b>. 

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the
different ways we use the information we gather. Keep in mind that, while Dice
encourages all third parties involved - including but not limited to its
advertisers - to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors
and members and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible
manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or
omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information
received either from Dice or independently. Nevertheless, in the event you
encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with Dice,
who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please
contact <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a> . We will be
happy to forward your message to the third party or contact the third party on
your behalf. 

</p>
<p>1. <b>How we use (and do not use)
non-personally identifiable information</b>: We use non-personally identifiable
information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by
performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior
of our visitors and members, and by measuring demographics and interests
regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information
based on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business
partners. We may also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to
the number of people who have seen and clicked through links to their sites.

</p>
<p>2. <b>How we use (and do not use)
personally identifiable information</b>: Dice does not sell, re-sell or
distribute for re-sale your personally identifiable information. Dice's
customers may only use the information provided in resumes and profiles of job
seekers to evaluate seekers' qualifications for the customer's open job
opportunities. Job seekers should be aware, however, that Dice has no way to
control how a customer actually uses the service and how they use the resume and
profile information. If you believe a Dice customer is using personally
identifiable information inappropriately, please notify Dice at <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.

</p>
<p>Please note that Dice reserves the
right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or member
as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business.
Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such
information when a visitor or member is in violation of our <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="/index.php?action=legal">Terms
of Use</a> or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably
suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even
without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such
information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas,
discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to
allegations of infringement. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in
identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal
activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity
to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate
your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity.
Finally, Dice reserves the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer
to a third party your personally identifiable information in connection with an
assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of any portion
or all of Dice's or its affiliated entities' assets or stock.

</p>
<p>Subject to the foregoing, Dice uses
your personally identifying information in several ways: 

</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>to customize various aspects
    of the Services to your preferences; 
    
  </li>
  <li>to determine which
    advertisements or sponsor messages will appear on your screen; 
    
  </li>
  <li>to send to you Dice
    solicitations, product announcements, and the like that we feel may be of
    interest to you (you may "opt out" of receiving these materials,
    as provided below); 
    
  </li>
  <li>to send to you certain e-mail
    messages that are critical to your use of the Services, such as system
    status updates or order confirmations (because these messages contain
    important information, you may not be able to "opt out" of
    receiving such messages); 
    
  </li>
  <li>to "pre-populate"
    forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by
    Dice and/or its sponsors (in no case will pre-populating a form
    automatically transfer any data to an advertiser or other third party - only
    if you voluntarily request that such data be transferred will any such
    transfer take place, e.g., by clicking the "Submit" button); and 
    
  </li>
  <li>as may be necessary to support
    the operation of the Services, such as for billing, account maintenance, and
    record-keeping purposes. 
    
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the circumstances
described above, Dice may disclose your personally-identifiable information to
third parties as follows:

</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>When a job seeker posts a
    profile or resume on Dice on a non-confidential basis, such information will
    be shared with Dice's customers. (Note that at any time, job seekers may
    elect that their profile and resume not be searchable by Dice's customers by
    logging into their account and changing the status of their profile or they
    may contact Dice at <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:support@dice.com">support@dice.com</a>
    and we will make the change for them.) 
    
  </li>
  <li>When a job seeker elects to
    make his or her profile searchable by Dice customers on a confidential basis
    only, the user's name, contact information and resume will not be displayed
    to customers performing searches on Dice. If the customer desires to contact
    the confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, it will
    send an email to the job seeker through the Dice system. Dice will forward
    the email to the seeker's email address. The seeker's email address will not
    be provided directly to the customer. 
    
  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>If you "opt in" to
    receive promotional materials (see below), information you have made
    available to Dice may be made available to third parties who provide goods
    or services that we believe may be of interest to you. 
    
  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>If you provide us with your
    credit card information, we will not release that information to third
    parties unless necessary to complete a transaction between you and such a
    third party. Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial
    institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal
    identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process
    transactions. 
    
  </li>
  <li>All information made available
    to Dice may be made available to our contractors and consultants, and
    professional advisors (such as attorneys or accountants), but only to the
    extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under
    a duty of confidentiality.
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
3. "<b>Opting In</b>": You may choose to "opt in" to receive
promotional materials from Dice and/or its affiliates, advertisers, or other
business partners. You will be given the opportunity to "opt in" to
receive such materials at every point at which we collect personally
identifiable information through the Services. You may change your "opt
in" status or "opt out" with respect to such materials at any
time by contacting us at <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>.
You may also contact those third parties directly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>C. Surveys and Sweepstakes</b>: 
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
Occasionally, Dice may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully.
</p>

<p>
<b>D. Deleting or correcting personal information.</b>
</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">
If you would like to have your personally identifiable information removed from Dice's database, or would like to correct an error in such information, please contact us at <a target="_BLANK" class="blue" href="mailto:privacy@dice.com">privacy@dice.com</a>, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within Dice databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however Dice reserves the right, from time to time, to re-contact former customers or users of Dice.</p>
