identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13).&nbsp; Federal
law requires website operators who collect personal information to acquire

into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by its Users to the
website and (2) tracking information gathered as the Users navigate through the
site.&nbsp; To make use of certain features on the Clevver.com Web site, Users need
to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration
process.&nbsp; For example, Clevver.com may ask for the User’s name, email address,
sex, age, and zip code, and Clevver.com also might request information on the
User’s interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and so on.
The information that a User supplies will help Clevver.com to offer the User
more personalized features, to tailor the site to the User’s interests, and to
make the Web site more useful to the User. </span></p>

Clevver.com may be unable to provide the User with services that it makes
