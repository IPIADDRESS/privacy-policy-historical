						<br><br>Welcome to this website, a service of Clevver Media LLC This statement discloses the privacy practices for this website, including an explanation of which personally identifiable information of yours is collected; the organization collecting the information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; which choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
						<br><br>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Clevver Media LLC through one of the feedback forms you will find on the website, or by sending a notice by U.S. Mail to Clevver Media LLC 8350 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 200 Beverly Hills, CA 90211, Attention: Director of Online Content.
						<br><br>Clevver Media LLC does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. Federal law requires website operators who collect personal information to first get parental consent, and children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.
						<br><br>The information gathered by Clevver Media LLC falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to the website and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through the site. 
						<br><br>To make use of certain features on our website visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. (We may ask, for example, for your name, e-mail address, sex, age, and zip code, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our site to your interests and make it more useful to you.
						<br><br>The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you choose not to supply the information, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our site. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our site without registration.
						<br><br>To help make our site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself, we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.
						<br><br>We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. We may use cookies to track the pages on our site visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our site.
						<br><br>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data-such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site.
						<br><br>To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Our site may also include links to other websites whose privacy policies we don't control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the address --known as a URL-- in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.
						<br><br>When we present information to our advertisers-to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website-it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site. From time to time, we may share information on visitors to our site with those marketing products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.
						<br><br>All information gathered on any Clevver Media LLC  website is stored within a Clevver-controlled database accessible only to Clevver and its agents. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by Clevver may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your e-mail address, for example, don't include it in any message you post publicly. 
					
						
						<br><br><b class="blue">Third Party Cookies</b><br>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.
