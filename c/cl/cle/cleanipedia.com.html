             <p>We may collect personal data from a variety of&nbsp;sources. This includes:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><p>Personal data you give us directly,</p> </li> 
              <li><p>Personal data we collect automatically, and</p> </li>

             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>Personal data&nbsp;means any information that can be used to identify directly or indirectly a specific individual. This definition includes personal data collected offline through our Consumer Engagement Centres, direct marketing campaigns, sweepstakes and competitions and online through our websites, applications and branded pages on third-party platforms and applications accessed or used through third-party platforms.</p> 
             <p>You may be asked to provide your personal data when you are in contact with us.&nbsp;Unilever UK Ltd&nbsp;companies&nbsp;may share&nbsp;your&nbsp;personal data with&nbsp;each other and other Unilever Group companies&nbsp;and&nbsp;use it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice. We&nbsp;may also combine&nbsp;it with other information to improve our products, services, content, and advertising.&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>You are&nbsp;not required&nbsp;to provide Unilever the personal data that we request, but if you choose not to do so, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services, or with a high quality of service or respond to any queries you may have.</p> 
             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <h2>Ways in which we collect your personal data</h2> 
             <p>We may collect personal data from a variety of&nbsp;sources. This includes:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><p>Personal data you give us directly. We collect data about how you use our services and products, such as the types of content you view or engage with, or the frequency and duration of your activities. We also collect personal data you provide us when you sign up for a marketing newsletter, complete a survey or register for an account to buy our products. In so doing, we may ask for personal data, such as your name, gender, date of birth, address, email address, telephone number or credit card details. Some Unilever brands may collect “special categories of personal data” about you with your explicit consent. For more information on the special categories of data we collect and how we use it, please refer to the relevant section below.</p> </li> 
              <li><p>Personal data we collect automatically. We also receive and store certain types of personal data whenever you interact with us online. For example, we use cookies and tracking technologies (to find out more, see our <a href="https://www.unilevernotices.com/privacy-key-terms.html">privacy key terms</a>) to obtain personal data when your web browser accesses our websites or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Unilever on other websites. Your personal data is also collected when you search, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire or communicate with our customer service teams. Examples of the types of personal data we collect include; IP address (to find out more see our <a href="https://www.unilevernotices.com/privacy-key-terms.html">privacy key terms</a>), device ID, location data, computer and connection information such as browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and purchase history – which Unilever sometimes&nbsp;aggregates&nbsp;with similar information from other consumers. During some of your internet browsing on Unilever’s websites we may also use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away&nbsp;from the page. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.</p> </li> 
              <li><p>Personal data we collect from other sources. We collect personal data from other sources including our trusted partnerships with third-parties and where we operate Unilever accounts on third-party platforms: For example, when you use the “like” functionality on Facebook or the +1 functionality on Google+. Additionally, we receive information about you and other visitors’ interactions with our advertising to measure whether our advertising is relevant and successful. We also collect information about you and your activities from a&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;when we jointly offer services or products, or from third-party data enrichment providers (to find out more see our <a href="https://www.unilevernotices.com/privacy-key-terms.html">privacy key terms</a>) who may deliver insights to Unilever about the personal data we hold.</p> </li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <h2>When and why we collect “special categories of personal data”</h2> 
             <p>Certain categories of personal data, such as race, ethnicity, religion, health, sexuality or biometric data are classified as “special categories of data” and benefit from&nbsp;additional protection&nbsp;under the European data protection legislation.</p> 
             <p>We&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the circumstances where we collect and process these special categories of data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>Unilever sometimes collects data related to your health such as allergies, pregnancy or skin type to send you tailored ads and relevant promotions. Unilever only collects and uses this personal data where you have provided us with your consent for us to do so. In some instances, you may have requested services or products that do not directly involve the collection of any special categories of data, but may imply or suggest your religion, health or other special categories of data.</p> 
             <p>To illustrate circumstances where Unilever collects and processes special categories of data we have provided the following examples:</p>

             <h2>How do we protect children’s privacy?</h2> 
             <p>We understand the importance of taking&nbsp;extra precautions&nbsp;to protect the privacy and safety of children using Unilever products and services.&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>Most of Unilever’s websites are designed and&nbsp;intended for use by adults. Where one of our websites is intended for use by a younger audience, we will obtain consent from the person with&nbsp;parental responsibility&nbsp;before we collect personal data where it is required by applicable laws and regulations (the age at which consent is necessary varies from&nbsp;Country&nbsp;to&nbsp;Country).&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>If you are a child under the age where parental consent is required in your&nbsp;Country, you should review the terms of this Privacy Notice with your&nbsp;parent&nbsp;or&nbsp;guardian&nbsp;to make sure you understand and accept them. If we discover that we have collected personal data from a child without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will&nbsp;delete&nbsp;that personal data as soon as practical. Access to certain parts of the Unilever’s websites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards are generally limited to users over a certain age.&nbsp;</p> 
             <p>We sometimes use your personal data to carry out&nbsp;age verification&nbsp;checks and enforce any such age restrictions.</p>

             </ul>

              <li><p>To provide&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;products, communications and targeted advertising as well as product recommendations to you.</p> </li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>When we collect and use your personal data for purposes mentioned above or for other purposes, we will&nbsp;inform&nbsp;you before or at the time of collection.</p> 
             <p>Where appropriate, we will ask for your&nbsp;consent&nbsp;to process the personal data. Where you have given consent for processing activities, you have the&nbsp;right to withdraw your consent&nbsp;at any time.</p> 
             <p>In some cases, we rely on&nbsp;legitimate interest&nbsp;for processing your personal data. A legitimate interest could exist for example, when you sign up for a loyalty scheme with one of our brands and we use the personal data collected to conduct data analytics to improve our products or services. This ground will only be used where it is necessary to achieve a legitimate interest, for example to assist in the performance of a contract, or to optimise a service, and does not outweigh your rights as an individual. This legal basis will only be relied upon where there is no less intrusive way to process your personal data. We can assure you that if legitimate interest is used as a ground for processing your personal data,&nbsp;we will keep a record of this and you have the right to ask for this information.</p> 
             <p>We process your personal data to perform a&nbsp;contract&nbsp;to which you are or will be a party. For example,&nbsp;we need to process your personal data&nbsp;to deliver a&nbsp;product or&nbsp;a&nbsp;service&nbsp;you bought, to allow you to take part in one of our competitions, or to send you samples that you have requested.</p> 
             <p>We&nbsp;also&nbsp;process&nbsp;your personal data when we have a&nbsp;legal obligation&nbsp;(e.g., tax or social security obligations) to perform such processing. For example, a court order or a subpoena may require us to process personal data for a&nbsp;particular purpose, or we may be&nbsp;compelled&nbsp;to process personal data&nbsp;to&nbsp;report suspicious transactions&nbsp;under the&nbsp;local anti-money&nbsp;laundering rules.</p> 
             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <h2>Profiling</h2> 
             <p>Unilever uses your personal data to build&nbsp;profiles.&nbsp;We create profiles by&nbsp;analysing&nbsp;the information about your online surfing, searching and buying behaviour and your interactions with our brand communications by building segments (creating groups that have certain common characteristics) and by placing your personal data in one or more segments. These segments are used by Unilever to&nbsp;personalise&nbsp;the website and our communications to you (such as showing relevant content to you when you visit our site or in a newsletter to you), and to display relevant offers and advertisements from the Unilever brands on the Unilever sites, and via third-party websites. The segments can also be used for third-party campaigns on the Unilever sites.&nbsp;Unilever profiles your data where you have provided&nbsp;consent&nbsp;for us to do so; for example, accepting the setting of cookies on your browser online or signing up for email newsletters from one of our brands.</p> 
             <p>You can&nbsp;withdraw your consent&nbsp;to prevent your personal data being used this way at any time using the&nbsp;manage cookies&nbsp;section of our <a href="https://www.unilevernotices.com/united-kingdom/english/cookie-notice/notice.html">Cookie Notice</a> or&nbsp;unsubscribing&nbsp;to the use of your email address if you have logged into one of our websites or signed up to any marketing newsletters.</p> 
             <p>By way of example –&nbsp;</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>Unilever collects data, with your consent, from:&nbsp; 
               <ul> 
                <li>Our websites about what you view and the&nbsp;way you interact&nbsp;with our content;  </li> 
                <li>Our&nbsp;digital display advertising&nbsp;that we serve to you on social platforms and other publisher’s websites; and  </li> 
                <li>Forms you fill&nbsp;in online and send to us about what your interests are.</li> 
               </ul> </li> 
              <li>We also track the&nbsp;products you buy&nbsp;when you click on one of our display adverts and go on to purchase something from a selection of our retail partners.</li> 
              <li>If you have asked to receive&nbsp;emails&nbsp;or&nbsp;SMS communications&nbsp;from us, we track whether you open, read or click on the content to see what you are interested in so that we can give you more content that we think you are more likely to enjoy.</li> 
              <li>We use this data to profile your&nbsp;likes&nbsp;and&nbsp;dislikes.  For instance, if we see that you are regularly viewing Vegan recipes on our “Recipedia” website, and you have opted in to receiving emails from us, we might give you an update on the new Vegan recipes that have just hit the site for your interest, or we may tailor our web content when you visit towards things we think you’ll be most interested in.</li> 
              <li>Based on this profile information, we may also give you advertising that we think you will&nbsp;like&nbsp;and&nbsp;want to see&nbsp;as you view content from us or from our network of publishers that we advertise with.  Sometimes, with your consent, we may use your current&nbsp;location&nbsp;to serve advertising to you that is to do with promotions or events that are happening nearby that we think you might be interested in.</li> 
              <li>We may also use information you have provided to&nbsp;selected&nbsp;third-parties&nbsp;and&nbsp;consented to be shared, like your age, gender, life stage, lifestyle and wider interests to identify people who we think will have similar interests to you and who we believe will be interested in similar advertising.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>&nbsp;</p> 
             <h2>Automated decision-making</h2> 
             <p>In some instances, Unilever processes your personal data using&nbsp;automated means. An automated decision is a decision which is made&nbsp;solely&nbsp;by automatic means,&nbsp;where&nbsp;no humans&nbsp;are involved in the decision-making process related to your personal data. For example:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><p>Unilever uses&nbsp;game simulations&nbsp;of&nbsp;science-based behavioural assessments&nbsp;and&nbsp;data science techniques&nbsp;to assess prospective employees. Candidates are required to play a set of games and the behavioural patterns exhibited during gameplay are assessed by a Unilever customised&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;to predict the&nbsp;candidate’s potential for a specific role. This algorithm is&nbsp;regularly tested&nbsp;to ensure it remains fair, effective and unbiased.</p> </li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>We will not make decisions based solely on automated decision making that have significant impact on you.&nbsp;If we do so we notify you and provide you with&nbsp;clear information&nbsp;about our decision to rely on automated processing to make our decision and our lawful basis for doing so. For example, Unilever processes your personal data using automated means only if it is necessary for the entering into or the performance of a&nbsp;contract&nbsp;with you, or when you have given your&nbsp;explicit consent.</p> 
             <p>You have the right&nbsp;not to be subject&nbsp;to a decision which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal or other significant effects on you.&nbsp;In particular, you&nbsp;have the right:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><p>to obtain&nbsp;human intervention;&nbsp;</p> </li> 
              <li><p>to express your&nbsp;point of view;</p> </li> 
              <li><p>to obtain an&nbsp;explanation of the decision&nbsp;reached after an assessment;&nbsp;and</p> </li> 
              <li><p>to&nbsp;challenge&nbsp;such a decision.</p> </li> 
             </ul>
