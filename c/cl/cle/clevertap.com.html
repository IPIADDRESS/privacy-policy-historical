We may encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us. However, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies that do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from or via the CleverTap Service and/or the CleverTap Websites, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</li>
