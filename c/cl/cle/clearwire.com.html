            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Clearwire is committed to protecting your privacy. Please read this privacy policy statement carefully so that you understand what kind of information we may gather about you, how we may use that information, whether we may disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of the information and your ability to correct the information. We will not trade, sell, or disclose to any third party any form of personally identifiable information without your consent, including information derived from registration, subscription, and use of the Clearwire service, except as stated below. This policy applies only to Clearwire, and not to other companies’ or organizations’ Web sites to which we link.</p>
            <p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
            <p>The information Clearwire gathers generally falls into three categories: (1) personal, business, and demographic information you supply that we use primarily for evaluating applicants and conducting market research; (2) information you supply when you register or initiate transactions; and (3) tracking information gathered as you navigate online. Some of this information identifies a particular person, but much of it does not. Third-party providers, whose sites are featured on and accessed via our site, may gather information as well. </p>
            <p>When you interact with Clearwire, when applying for Service, for example, we may request some or all of the following information: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contact information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address) </li>
              <li>Credit card, debit card or check card and Clearwire account number </li>
              <li>Driver's license </li>
              <li>Company name (for corporate accounts)</li>
              <li>Household characteristics (e.g., number of children and number of Internet users)</li>
              <li>Technology employed (e.g., type of Internet access and specifications for your computer)</li>
            </ul>            
            <p><strong>Why We Collect This Information</strong></p>
            <p>We need this information to process your application or service order and to conduct market research. If we have trouble processing your application or order, we use the contact information you provide to get in touch with you. We also use your contact information to provide you with Clearwire updates or to assist you with your wireless broadband service and to inform you of new products or services that may be of interest to you. </p>
            <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>To help make our website more responsive to your needs, we use a standard feature of browser software nicknamed “cookies.” We use cookies to help us tailor our website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service, and to remember certain choices you’ve made so you don’t have to re-enter them. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
            <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize Clearwire pages, or register with Clearwire sites or services, a cookie helps Clearwire recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, preferred email address, and so on. When you return to Clearwire, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Clearwire features that you customized.</p>
            <p>We use two kinds of cookies: (i) temporary or “session”-based cookies that contain certain information about a user’s or visitor’s use of our website at a particular time and (ii) “persistent” cookies that contain certain account-related information about a registered user’s use of our website. Session-based cookies are automatically disabled or deleted when a user of or visitor to our website closes his or her browser software at the end of session. Persistent cookies remain stored on a registered user’s computer system until he or she disables or deletes them. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies or you delete them, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to and users of our website. </p>
            <p><strong>Information Collected by Third Parties</strong></p>
            <p>Of course, our site includes links to other web sites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another web site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through a Web site linked to our web site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. The provider's privacy practices may differ from ours. Please be aware that these third-party sites may also use their own cookies, web beacons or third-party software or “spyware”, for which we are not responsible.</p>
            <p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
            <p>We consider the personal information contained in our business records to be confidential. Clearwire will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties private e-mail, conversations, or other communications, except as described here, that are transmitted using our services. We may sometimes disclose information about you to our business partners or to others who work for us. We may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Clearwire; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Clearwire including, without limitation the security and integrity of our network; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our services or members of the public. </p>
            <p>As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Clearwire, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another company, information about our visitors would be among the transferred assets. </p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>Clearwire is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. As effective as modern security practices are, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We have implemented strict internal guidelines to ensure that your privacy is safeguarded at every level of our organization. Clearwire will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new technologies become available.</p>
            <p><strong>Clearwire and Kids</strong></p>
            <p>Clearwire takes care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our services, and encourages you to participate in your child's experience in cyberspace. We do not sell products or services to kids. Also, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children and teenagers under the age of 18 and Clearwire does not wish to collect any such information. </p>
            <p>Parents, please note that if you grant consent for your child to use our services, your child will be able to communicate with other users of all ages. Before providing consent, please be aware that your child will be able to disclose personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone numbers) on his or her own. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You can obtain additional information about safe surfing through the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission web site</a>.</p>
            <p>Federal law requires website operators who collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen to first get parental consent. Clearwire will not knowingly link to any third party web site that solicits or collects personally identifiable information from minors.</p>
            <p><strong>Clearwire Spam Policy </strong></p>
            <p>Clearwire will deal with Spam complaints seriously and will close spammer’s customer accounts. We may use customer information to investigate and prevent potentially unlawful activity that threatens the service or network integrity or otherwise violates the service agreement. </p>
            <p><strong>What Is Spam?</strong> </p>
            <p>Spam is email that is sent against the wishes of the recipient. There are two kinds. The first kind of spam concerns individuals who email people that they don't know personally. The second type of spam is sent by organizations to individuals who have not expressed a desire to receive such communications. Both kinds of spam are inappropriate.</p>
            <p><strong>Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</strong></p>
            <p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should contact Clearwire. </p>
            <p><strong>European Union Data Considerations</strong></p>
            <p>Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Clearwire or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Clearwire abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. </p>
            <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes </strong></p>
            <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. By continuing to use Clearwire after we post any changes, you accept and agree to this privacy statement, as modified. Of course, our use of information gathered while the current privacy statement is in effect will be consistent with the current statement, even if we change that statement later.</p>
