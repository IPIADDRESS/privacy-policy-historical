In some cases the University’s interests can be served by providing goods and services to its students, parents, alumni and employees. The University provides much of this support and many services internally; however there are a number of supportive functions which for various reasons are performed by affiliated entities or private contractors.</p>
<p>To this end, the university will implement the Family Privacy Protection Act (FPPA) as follows:</p>

<li>Only so much information is released as is necessary to accomplish the stated purpose for the request.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>Contractors</b>. The University will release necessary personal information of affected persons to a contractor performing tasks which are essential to the fulfillment of the university’s mission, provided:<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>The contract was reached after compliance with applicable procurement requirements;</li>
<li>The contract is in support of an essential element of one of the University’s legitimate public purposes;</li>

</ol></li>
<li><b>Third Parties</b>. Subject to the provisions of the S.C. Freedom of Information Act or the Family Educational Right to Privacy Act, personal information which identifies an individual may be released to third parties, provided:<ol class="upper-alpha">
<li>The university first notifies the requestor that: “The information that you have requested is personal information under South Carolina law. It is a violation of South Carolina law to use this personal information for commercial solicitation”;</li>
<li>The requestor provides written acknowledgment that: “I understand that it is a violation of South Carolina criminal law to use the personal information that I have requested for purposes of commercial solicitation”;</li>
<li>Only so much personal information is released as is necessary to accomplish the stated purpose of the request;</li>
<li>Exemptions are contained in Section 30-2-30 (3). A party claiming to be exempt from the application of FPPA will cite the source of the claimed exemption. The requesting party will be advised that the personal information is provided solely for its use under the stated exemption and that any use for commercial solicitation by any other party is illegal under S.C. law.</li>
</ol>
