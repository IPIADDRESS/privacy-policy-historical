  		<h1 class="heading">Family Privacy Protection Act Policy</h1>
	    <p>(Enacted Pursuant to S.C. Code Section 30-2-10 et. seq.)*</p>
<p>The University is a complex agency which has a variety of legitimate public purposes encompassing teaching, research and extension. It is in the University’s best interest to promote strong and effective affiliated foundations and entities and to provide goods and services to its students, parents, alumni and employees which promote the interests of the University. The University provides much of this support internally; however there are a number of supportive functions which for various reasons are performed by affiliated entities or private contractors.</p>
<p>To this end, the university will implement the Family Privacy Protection Act (FPPA) as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Responsibility. It shall be the responsibility of the Office of Institutional Research to implement compliance with the FPPA, and specifically Section 30-2-40 A.</li>
<li>Evaluation. The university will engage in an ongoing evaluation to ensure that the personal information it gathers in its various programs is necessary for the performance of the university’s legitimate public purposes.</li>
<li>Personal Rights. The university will continue to inform all persons from whom the university collects personal information (hereinafter, ‘affected persons’) of their rights under applicable laws, including the South Carolina Personal Privacy Protection Act (SC Code Section 30-2-10 et. seq.) and the Family Educational and Right to Privacy Act (20 USC 1232g), as appropriate.</li>
<li>Campus Directory Information. The university has determined that publication of its annual campus telephone directory is a business necessity. The university will release this directory to third parties only after notifying the requestor that the information therein may not be used for commercial solicitation and receiving written acknowledgement that the material will not be used for commercial solicitation. The telephone directory and any Web directories containing personal information will contain the warnings referred to in Section 30-2-50 of the FPPA.</li>
<li>Foundations and Affiliated Entities. The university will release necessary personal information concerning affected persons to an affiliated entity, that is, an institute, association, foundation, etc, in direct support of the university, provided: A. The use for which the material is requested is for a legitimate public purpose in support of the University’s public mission; B. The entity acknowledges that the material is to be used only for the purpose or purposes specified; C. The entity acknowledges that the material will not be released to a third party without the university’s written consent; D. Any contractors of the entity must acknowledge in writing that the material is to be used only for the contracted purpose, and will not be released to third parties without written permission from the University; and E. Only so much information is released as is necessary to accomplish the stated purpose for the request.</li>
<li>Contractors. The University will release necessary personal information of affected persons to a contractor performing tasks which are essential to the fulfillment of the university’s mission, provided: A. The contract was reached after compliance with applicable procurement requirements; B. The contract is in support of an essential element of one of the University’s legitimate public purposes; C. The contractor acknowledges that the material will only be used to fulfill the contract; D. The contractor acknowledges that the material will not be disclosed to third parties, without the university’s written consent; and E. Only so much information is released as is necessary to accomplish the stated purpose of the contract.
</li>
<li>Third Parties. Subject to the provisions of the S.C. Freedom of Information Act or the Family Educational Right to Privacy Act, personal information which identifies an individual may be released to third parties, provided: A. The university first notifies the requestor that: “The information that you have requested is personal information under South Carolina law. It is a violation of South Carolina law to use this personal information for commercial solicitation”; B. The requestor provides written acknowledgment that: “I understand that it is a violation of South Carolina criminal law to use the personal information that I have requested for purposes of commercial solicitation”; C. Only so much personal information is released as is necessary to accomplish the stated purpose of the request; and D. Exemptions are contained in Section 30-2-30 (3). A party claiming to be exempt from the application of FPPA will cite the source of the claimed exemption. The requesting party will be advised that the personal information is provided solely for its use under the stated exemption and that any use for commercial solicitation by any other party is illegal under S.C. law.
</li>
<li>University Use. The university may use any of the personal information it collects from affected persons as necessary to accomplish, or in support of, any of its legitimate public purposes. The university may provide mailing services to or for third parties, provided that the purpose of such services is not commercial solicitation.</li>
</ol>
