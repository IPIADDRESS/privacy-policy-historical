            <h1 class="title-text">ClearSlide, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>ClearSlide, Inc. ("<strong>ClearSlide</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>we</strong>") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy describes ClearSlide's information practices.</p>

            <p>ClearSlide provides a variety of web-based and mobile services designed specifically for the communication needs of sales teams (the "Services"). The Services are made available to users who have ClearSlide accounts ("Customers") via the web site located at www.clearslide.com (the "Site"). ClearSlide Customers use the Services to communicate with their customers and sales prospects ("Viewers"). The Services allow Customers to upload presentations, sales collateral and other content ("Content") to the Site, in addition to information about Viewers. Customers then use the Services to communicate with Viewers and share Content in a variety of ways, including via email and browser-based online presentations. Customers retain all rights to Content they upload to the ClearSlide Service. ClearSlide will not access or modify Content except as necessary to provide the Services, prevent or resolve service or technical problems, or at Customer's request in connection with support matters. ClearSlide will not disclose Customer Content except as described in this privacy policy or the agreement governing Customer's use of our Services, or for purposes of allowing Customer to share Content with Viewers via the Services.</p>

            <p>Throughout this policy we will use the term personally identifiable information ("<strong>PII</strong>") to describe information that can be used to identify a person. We do not consider all information to be PII, and we do not consider information that has been anonymized to be PII.</p>

            <p>The Site and Services (including Content viewed thereon) may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of other web sites to understand their information practices.</p>

            <h2>Information You Provide to ClearSlide and How We Use It</h2>

            <p><strong>Customers</strong>: If you are a Customer, ClearSlide may require that you provide information (including PII) to allow us to deliver the Services, to manage and administer your account, and for billing purposes. To those ends, we may require Customers to submit information such as their name, company, email address, phone number, credit card number, billing address, and financial qualification information.</p>

            <p>Customers also provide other information to ClearSlide through their use of the Services. For example, the Services allow Customers to input names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other information about Viewers that Customers wish to use the Services to communicate with. ClearSlide does not use or access such information except with Customer's permission, in order to provide the Services, and to provide related support and assistance. ClearSlide does not sell this information. ClearSlide does not use this information to contact Viewers except on Customer's behalf and at Customer's direction. ClearSlide will not allow other ClearSlide customers to access this information.</p>

            <p>Customers may also submit Content for use in connection with the Services, including for the purpose of sharing such Content and communicating with Viewers. Customers are solely responsible for all Content and other information they input into the Services.</p>

            <p><strong>Viewers</strong>: If you are a Viewer, a Customer may request that you provide them with information (including PII) via the Services in order to view Customer Content. ClearSlide stores this information on behalf of our Customers. In the event you provide a Customer with this information, you do so in accordance with that Customer's privacy practices and policies. ClearSlide is not responsible for the privacy practices of its Customers, and does not access this information except with Customer's permission, in order to provide the Services and related support and assistance.</p>

We collect this information to help us improve our Site.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>

            <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computing device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's computing device.</p>

            <p>When you access ClearSlide's Site or use our Services to access Content that has been sent to you we may place cookies on your computer or other computing device. We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret them and the information stored within. You may decline our cookies if your browser permits it, but doing so will interfere with your use of our Site and Services, and will impact the performance, operation and delivery of Services to you.</p>

            <h2>With Whom Will We Share Your Information?</h2>

            <p>Our primary goal in collecting any information from you, including PII, is to provide you with the best Service we can. We believe we offer a unique Service which greatly improves the ability of our customers to sell and communicate to their customers. ClearSlide does not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

            <p>ClearSlide may share information collected from you with third party service providers that perform work on ClearSlide's behalf or which ClearSlide utilizes to deliver, monitor, or improve the Site and Services. ClearSlide may, at your request and on your behalf, share your information with your own third party service providers (for example, information about your use of the Site and Services may be shared via API with a CRM system such as Salesforce).</p>

            <h2>We may also share your information in connection with the following:</h2>

            <p><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>: ClearSlide reserves the right to use or disclose any information provided by Visitors, Customers or Viewers if required by law or if ClearSlide reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect the ClearSlide's rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.</p>

            <p><strong>As Part of an Asset Transfer</strong>: In the event ClearSlide goes through a business transaction such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets to which this privacy policy relates, your information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur.</p>

            <p><strong>Cross-Border Transfer</strong>: Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to provide PII to us, we may transfer the information to the United States and processes it there.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>ClearSlide protects your information online by using industry standard encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access to Content, data, and Customer account information stored on our servers. To learn more about encryption generally, please <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">click here</a>.</p>

            <p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, please click here. We encrypt PII in our databases, and we use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to transmit and receive this information from you.</p>

            <p>ClearSlide and its service providers also maintain strict physical security at properties and facilities and only provide access to authorized personnel.</p>

            <p>Access to the information you provide us with is restricted to those of our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Site or Services.</p>

            <p>While we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about security on our Site or Services, you can email us at <a href="mailto:security@clearslide.com">security@clearslide.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Children</h2>

            <p>The Services and Site are not intended for use by children under the age of 18, and we do not intentionally collect any information from users under the age of 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided ClearSlide with PII, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:security@clearslide.com">security@clearslide.com</a>. If you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected such information through our Site, please notify us at <a href="mailto:security@clearslide.com">security@clearslide.com</a> so that we may immediately delete the information from our servers.</p>

            <h2>How Can You Review or Request Changes to Your Information?</h2>

            <p>Customers may update or change their account information by editing their user, group, or team records within the account management pages of the Site. To update a Customer profile, login to your ClearSlide account at http://www.clearslide.com and click on "My Account." You will then be able to change your name, address and phone number, which notification emails you receive from us, and your Live Pitch link URL and your password.</p>

            <p>To update Customer billing information, contact your account manager or email <a href="mailto:billing@clearslide.com">billing@clearslide.com</a> for assistance.</p>

            <p>If you are a Viewer, you may opt-out of receiving emails you receive from specific Customers by clicking on the "opt-out" link at the bottom of the email you received, or you may email us at <a href="mailto:security@clearslide.com">security@clearslide.com</a> or call us at 1-800-360-DEMO (3366).</p>

            <p>If you have signed up to receive marketing emails from ClearSlide, you can opt-out of receiving future marketing emails by following the foregoing process. Customers cannot opt-out of receiving all transactional emails related to their ClearSlide account, but may change their account settings (as described above) to reduce the frequency of certain ClearSlide notification emails.</p>

            <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>ClearSlide reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time in our sole discretion. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will notify you of changes by posting a new privacy policy to our home page on the Site and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Please review our privacy policy frequently. Your continued use of our Services and Site following any changes to this privacy policy constitute your acceptance of such changes, and any amended privacy policy will apply to information previously collected.</p>
