We may use certain standard web measurement and tracking technologies such as "cookies," web server logs, or other statistics programs to collect Usage Information and track and record how you use the Website. This data is anonymous and does not personally identify you. We use cookies to (a) remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service; (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior; (c) track your progress in surveys; and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information. We also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track your session while maintaining your anonymity. We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In those limited cases where session information is not anonymous, Clear Voice Surveys will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity to "opt out". Research companies that you may take surveys with through Clear Voice Surveys may also use their own cookies. The content of such cookies and the use of the information they contain is controlled by the individual research companies, not by Clear Voice Surveys. In connection with our online ad exposure program, you can participate in surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that we are testing for our clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, our clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies, and/or any other related technology (each a “Third Party Technology” and collectively the “Third Party Technologies”). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set, or read in various locations, including, without limitation, our servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and our client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, our client will send your UID and the specific survey, and we will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.<br>
