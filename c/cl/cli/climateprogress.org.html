For example, only select American Progress staff and contracted individuals have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to non-public areas of our sites.  We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving sensitive personal and financial data from our site.

Please contact us if you believe there has been any breach of the security of our sites. </p>
