<h2>Cliqset Privacy</h2>
<p>Last updated: May 29, 2009</p>
</div>

<div class="minor-block">
<p>Cliqset believes that users should own and control their social
information. Toward that end, Cliqset helps you build and share social
information with any and all Cliqset-enabled websites and applications
you use. You choose what information you put in your profile, including
contact and personal information, pictures, and interests, and you
control the sites with whom you share that information through your
personal privacy settings.</p>
<p>Cliqset 's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how
we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and
help you make informed decisions when using Cliqset services
(collectively, " Cliqset " or "Website").</p>

<p>By using or accessing Cliqset, you are accepting the practices
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you
should first contact our privacy staff at <a class="inlinelink" href="mailto:privacy@cliqset.com">privacy@cliqset.com</a>.</p>


<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
<p>When you visit Cliqset you provide us with two types of
information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that
is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you
interact with our Web Site.</p>
<p>When you register with Cliqset, you provide us with certain
personal information, such as your name, your email address, your
telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any
other personal or preference information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>When you enter Cliqset, we collect your browser type and IP
address. This information is gathered for all Cliqset visitors. In
addition, we store certain information from your browser using
"cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer
tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm
that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes
the browser. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy
of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion
to the prior version of that information.</p>

<p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on
Cliqset is a violation of the Cliqset Developer Terms of Service and/or
Cliqset Terms of Use and should be reported to <a class="inlinelink" href="mailto:privacy@cliqset.com">privacy@cliqset.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend
about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the
invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will automatically
send your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her
to visit the site. Cliqset stores this information to send this one-time
invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is
accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend
may contact us at <a class="inlinelink" href="mailto:privacy@cliqset.com">privacy@cliqset.com</a> to request
that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>By using Cliqset, you are consenting to have your personal data
transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>


<h3>Children Under Age 13</h3>

<p>Cliqset does not knowingly collect or solicit personal
information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to
register for Cliqset or send any information about yourself to us,
including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one
under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Cliqset. In
the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from
a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will
delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we
might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
contact us at <a class="inlinelink" href="mailto:privacy@cliqset.com">privacy@cliqset.com</a>.</p>


<h3>Use of Information Obtained by Cliqset</h3>
<p>When you register with Cliqset, you create your own profile and
privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email
and photo, are displayed to people in the social networks specified in
your privacy settings. We may occasionally use your name and email
address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by
Cliqset that we think you may find valuable.</p>
<p>Profile information is used by Cliqset primarily to be presented
back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be
presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy
settings.</p>
<p>Cliqset may use information in your profile without identifying
you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as
aggregating statistical information or personalizing advertisements and
promotions so that we can provide you. We believe this benefits you.</p>


<h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>

<p>Cliqset is about helping you share your information with social
networkign sites without the need for you to enter the same information
about yourself for each social networking site you use, while providing
you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your
information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to
social networks through Cliqset. Our network architecture and your
privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access
to your information. We do not provide contact information to third
party marketers without your permission. We share your information with
third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such
sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally
required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring
you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to
facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location
facility for servers, to send out email updates about Cliqset, to remove
repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for
products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to
provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In
connection with these offerings and business operations, our service
providers may have access to your personal information for use for a
limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we
utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we
implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the
use of that information to the Cliqset-specified purposes.</p>
<p>If you use any third-party applications developed using the
Cliqset API ("Developed Applications"), those Developed Applications may
access and share certain information about you with others in accordance
with your privacy settings. You may opt-out of any sharing of certain or
all information through Developed Applications using your personal
privacy settings. In addition, third party developers who have created
and operate Developed Applications, may also have access to your
personal information (excluding your contact information) if you permit
them to access your data. Before allowing any Developer to make any
Developed Application available to you, Cliqset requires the Developer
to enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to
respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their collection, use,
and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken
contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such
information by such Developers, we of course cannot and do not guarantee
that all such Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that
Cliqset does not screen or approve Developers and cannot control how
such Developers use any personal information that they may obtain in
connection with Developed Applications. In addition, Developers may
require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies
or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose
additional obligations on you, so please make sure to review these terms
and policies carefully before using any Developed Application. You can
report any suspected misuse of information through the Cliqset
Application and we will investigate any such claim and take appropriate
action against the Developer up to and including terminating their
participation in the Cliqset Application and/or other formal legal
action.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to
lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance
with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good
faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private
litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share
account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply
with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or
other illegal activity perpetrated through the Cliqset service or using
the Cliqset name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include
sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government
agencies.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Cliqset
business, or individual business units owned by Cliqset, Inc., were to
change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the
service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information,
your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any
pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>


<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Cliqset may contain links to other websites. We are of course not
responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage
our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy
statements of each and every web site that collects personally
identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to
information collected by Cliqset.</p>

<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
<p>Advertisements that appear on Cliqset are sometimes delivered (or
"served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They
automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third
party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use
other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as
"1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to
recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in
order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about
where individuals using your computer or browser saw their
advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Cliqset
does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by
the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to
your contact information stored on Cliqset unless you choose to share it
with them.</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Cliqset and does
not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of
its advertisers.</p>


<h3>Changing or Removing Information</h3>
<p>Access and control over most personal information on Cliqset is
readily available through the profile editing tools. Cliqset users may
modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging
into their account.</p>



<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Cliqset takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect our
users' information. Your account information is located on a secured
server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not
recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send
private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you
have any questions about the security of Cliqset Web Site, please
contact us at <a class="inlinelink" href="mailto:privacy@cliqset.com">privacy@cliqset.com</a></p>


<h3>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</h3>
<p>Your use of Cliqset, and any disputes arising from it, is subject
to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use, Developer Terms of
Service and all of their respective dispute resolution provisions
including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We
reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy, Developer Terms of
Service and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and
clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will
take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site unless the
changes are deemed by Cliqset to be necessary to protect personally
identifiable information. If we make changes, we will post them and will
indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. If we
make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email,
or through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this
policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy
policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to
all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
