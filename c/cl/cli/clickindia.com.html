This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in connection with www.ClickIndia.com (the Site). This Privacy Policy may be updated by us at any time by posting on the site without any prior notice. Also, this Privacy Statement may be supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between us and an individual from time to time.
In this Privacy Statement, personal information means any information about an identifiable individual, including contact and demographic details, not including collective information or information regarding a group in summarized form.<br><br></div>

<b class="see">Collection of Personal Information</b><div class="text" align="justify">

The Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level) and other information that is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Site or regarding services offered by us.
This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads. One of the express purposes of the Site is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items that are for sale by customers. We have no control over who views online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. We collect customers financial information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the user for products and services, but retain this information only as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be required by law.<br>
Demographic and profile data is also collected at the Site. We use this data to tailor each visitor's experience at the Site, showing the user content that we think he or she might be interested in, and displaying the content according to the users preferences.<br>
Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our products and services. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Opt-Out section below).<br>
We may use customer information for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. We also use information from customers for accounting and transaction completion purposes.<br><br></div>

<b class="see">Disclosure of Personal Information</b><div class="text" align="justify">

We may disclose certain personal information as follows:<br>
- by publishing ads either online and/or in print, as the case may be, in connection with items that are for sale by customers<br>
- to third party service providers and to affiliated entities in order to carry out work on our behalf,<br>
- to law enforcement agencies for the purposes of investigating fraud or other offences, or<br>
- to legal, financial, and other professional advisors or in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of its business or operations.<br>
Except as provided above, we will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required or permitted by law.<br><br></div>

<b class="see">Cookies and IP Addresses</b><div class="text" align="justify">

We also provide an option to log out should you be using an insecure or publicly shared computer.<br>

We protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information with security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. However, it is possible that any information transmitted via the Internet may be intercepted by unknown third parties. We use Verisign to have credit card data transmitted to our network servers in a secure encrypted mode.<br><br></div>
