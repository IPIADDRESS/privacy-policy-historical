<div><h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<div class="pb12 mt3 j lh bb bc4 pl1">
This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in connection with www.ClickIndia.com (the Site). This Privacy Policy may be updated by us at any time by posting on the site without any prior notice. Also, this Privacy Statement may be supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between us and an individual from time to time.
In this Privacy Statement, personal information means any information about an identifiable individual, including contact and demographic details, not including collective information or information regarding a group in summarized form.<br></div>

<span class="c9">Collection of Personal Information<br></span>
The Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or income level) and other information that is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Site or regarding services offered by us.
This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads. One of the express purposes of the Site is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items that are for sale by customers. We have no control over who views online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. We collect customers financial information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the user for products and services, but retain this information only as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be required by law.<br><br>
