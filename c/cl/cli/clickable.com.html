            certain restricted sections of our Site or responding to our promotions, we require
            Customers to register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the
            "Service(s)"). Registration is required when visitors to the Site apply to use the
            Service as Customers during a trial Evaluation Period, and further information may
            be required to continue paid use of the Service after the Evaluation Period. During
            registration Customers will be asked to give us certain personally identifiable
            information, such as their user name, password, name, company name, address, phone
            number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information,
            such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within
            the organization that will be using the Service ("Registration Data"). To use the
            Service you will be asked to provide certain Advertising Account information. Clickable
            will share such Advertising Account information with third party advertising providers
            as necessary to implement your advertising campaign management decisions. We may
            also request additional information when you express interest in attaining additional
            information on our Service, such additional personal information may include, but
            is not limited to, title, department name, fax number, or additional company information,
            such as annual revenues, number of employees, or industry. During Customer use of
            the Site or Service after registration, we may collect additional profiling information
            to customize the Service to your needs. If you contact us via e-mail through the
            Site, we may retain a record of your contact information and any information you
            provide us in your message to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact
            information to market to you and provide you with information about our Service
            and those of our partners. Any additional personally identifiable information you
            provide will be added to your Registration Data. Customers can opt out of providing
            this additional information by not entering it when asked. In certain cases, your
            choice not to provide the requested information may mean that the Service or certain
            features are not available to you or work in a reduced fashion. Customers can update
            or remove some of their personally identifiable registration data at any time by
            logging into the Site and editing their User Account. Customers who remove or edit
            required Customer data, may not be able to receive the Services. Customers can view
            their updated User Account to confirm their edits have been made unless such edits
            have caused a removal or discontinuation of the User Account entirely. Clickable
            reserves the right to withhold or deny the Service to you or any person or entity,
            or to condition access to all or certain portions of the Site for any reason, including
            but not limited to your refusal to provide or removal of information Clickable deems
            necessary to provide the Service or Site access in question. If a User Account has
            been created on your behalf without your consent, your sole remedy is to contact
            Clickable at security@Clickable.com and ask that your User Account be disabled and
            your personally identifiable information and Registration Data be deleted from Clickable's
            data repository.

        <h4>
            How We Use Information:
        </h4>
        <p>
            Clickable uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for individuals
            and their organizations, and to transmit certain data and instructions to third
            party advertising providers upon your request. We may also use the information we
            collect to contact Customers about the details of Customer's interest in our company,
            our Service, including promotions and events, and to send information regarding
            our company or partners. Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by
            providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal Customer information
            will not be distributed or shared with third parties except employees, directors,
            representatives, consultants or agents of Clickable acting on our behalf after agreeing
            to our privacy policies and procedures. At certain locations on the Site Customers
            may receive solicitations to participate in third party services. Upon clicking
            on such third party links, Customers may be redirected to a third party site. When
            this occurs, your browser will indicate that you have left the Site by displaying
            the third party site name in your address bar. In such cases, the third party privacy
            policy will govern any information you provide. Customers may opt out of being contacted
            by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to
            support@Clickable.com or where possible by deactivating promotional material at
            an opt out field in your User Account. We may also email information regarding updates
            to the Service or about the company or its partners. Clickable at all times reserves
            the right to use your e-mail address for administrative purposes such as notifying
            you about Clickable updates, security notices, changes in policy or procedure and
            general notices regarding the Service ("administrative notices"). You may not opt
            out of these administrative notices, but do have the option of having your account
            disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided
            for in the Services Agreement, we do not disclose to third parties the information
            provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site
            is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill
            for the Service. It may be necessary for Clickable to transmit this information
            to independent contractors who we have a relationship with, and who are bound to
            us by written confidentiality agreements. This billing information is not used by
            Clickable for marketing or promotional purposes. Clickable uses a third-party intermediary
            to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution
            chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except
            for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content
            providers, may provide content on the Site. If Clickable refers you to such third
            party sites, you will have the option to choose whether or not to provide such third
            party with any personally identifiable information, in which case you will agree
            to be bound by their privacy policy. You hereby agree that Clickable shall be entitled
            to receive back from such third party a record of any purchase or transactions you
            have entered into with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customers of the Service will use the Site to host data and information ("Data").
            Clickable will not, share, distribute, or reference any Data except as provided
            in the Services Agreement, or as may be required by law. Customers of the Service
            may also engage in transactions in which instructions including Data, personally
            identifiable information, and/or financial information, are transmitted by their
            request to third parties who execute such transactions on Customer's behalf ("Customer
            Orders"). All such Customer Orders are governed by the Services Agreement. Data
            submitted to the subject advertisers will also be held by them pursuant to their
            privacy policies and other agreements you may have with them. Individual User Accounts
            may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of providing the Service,
            resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Services Agreement,
            or as may be required by law. Compilations, aggregations, derivations and normalized
            records of Customers are the exclusive property of Clickable and may be referenced
            by Clickable or its agents for any purpose, including but not limited to developing
            and refining algorithms used in the provision of the Service to Customers. Customers
            are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their username
            and password.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clickable may also collect certain information from visitors to and Customers of
            the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose
            technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the
            quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate
            usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and Customers and provide
            such information to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site,
            we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Clickable will automatically
            send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Clickable's business develops, Clickable may seek additional financing or sell
            certain of its assets. In such transactions, Customer information and Data will
            likely be among the assets valued or transferred. In the event Clickable requires
            financing or substantially all of its assets are acquired through merger or otherwise,
            our Customer information and Data may be reviewed and transferred. Clickable reserves
            the right to permit third party review of such information so long as the third
            party has entered into a binding confidentiality agreement with Clickable covering
            this Customer information and Data.

            Cookies:
        </h4>
        <p>
            Clickable improves your experience when accessing our Site or Services by using
            small pieces of data sent to your computer by our Web server to collect information
            about online behavior ("Cookie(s)"). Cookies tell us whether you have visited the
            Site or used the Service before. Clickable may also use Cookies to identify which
            sites our Customers are coming from.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless you choose to identify yourself to Clickable, Cookies will only identify
            your browser and not directly identify you. You may choose to disable Cookies in
            your browser but the result will be that some of the usability features such as
            user preferences may not work at all or as well. Clickable may use two types of
            Cookies: session and persistent-based. Session Cookies disappear at the end of each
            online session. They are removed from your computer when you exit your browser software
            or turn off your computer. Persistent Cookies remain on your computer after you've
            exited your browser and turned off your computer and require certain steps to remove
            them. Persistent Cookies are used to store information like user unique identifiers
            for your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clickable uses session Cookies to allow the system to uniquely identify you while
            you are logged in. This information allows Clickable to process your online transactions
            and requests. Session Cookies allow Clickable to make sure you are who you say you
            are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Clickable Services.
            Clickable uses persistent Cookies, that only Clickable can read and use, to identify
            the fact that you are a Clickable customer or prior Clickable Site visitor. We are
            especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored
            in persistent Cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords
            in persistent Cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept Cookies
            will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our
            Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clickable may from time to time engage third parties to measure statistical information
            about visitors to our Site and their usage of the Site and Service. Such third parties
            may use Cookies to assist in tracking visitor behavior. Such Cookies will not be
            used to associate any visitor with their personally identifiable information and
            is not shared with any other parties.

            Clickable may track various actions on Customers' web sites including visitor behavior,

            respect to visitors to such Customer sites, as a result of clicking on a Customer
            ad on a search engine, our server may place a tracking Cookie on such visitor's
            computer and will use non personally identifiable information including information
            about the browser and IP address to track whether the referral results in a transaction
            as defined by our Customer.
