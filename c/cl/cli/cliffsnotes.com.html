<h2 class="content-title" style="margin:0;">Introduction</h2>
<p>CliffsNotes.com is a valuable study guide resource for students of all ages. Our information collection practices are described below. We at CliffsNotes, along with our parent company, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., urge kids under age 13 to check with their parent or guardian before entering information on this Web site or any Web site</p>

<h2 class="content-title">Our Information Collection Practices</h2>
<h2 class="content-title">Overview</h2>
<p>The CliffsNotes imprint is proudly part of the John Wiley &amp; Sons stable of educational and reference books. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. and its related companies (collectively, "Wiley") recognize the importance of protecting the information collected from users in the operation of this Web site, and take reasonable steps to maintain the security, integrity and privacy of any information in accordance with this Privacy and Data Protection Policy. By submitting your information to Wiley you consent to the practices described herein.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">A note to Web site visitors who are 13 or younger and their parent or guardian</h2>
<p>Wiley is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). More specific information collection practices regarding users under 13 are outlined below. If you are a parent or guardian and would like to access, change or delete any personally identifiable information that we have collected from your child, or if you have any other questions about your child's use of this Web site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:cliffstips@cliffsnotes.com">cliffstips@cliffsnotes.com</a>. Please include your child's member name and e-mail address, as well as your own name and e-mail address, in any communication to assist us in responding to your inquiry or request.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">What types of identifiable personal information does Wiley collect about users when they browse this Web site?</h2>
<p>None. Wiley does not require users to provide any personal information when browsing this Web site. They may read our articles and study guides and browse our Literature Note content without inputting any personal information.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">Does Wiley track which pages on this Web site individual users visit or browse?</h2>
<p>Yes, we may use cookies in a variety of ways, such as to collect information to help us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Cookies are small bits of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are when you return. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits more enjoyable or customize your experience. We don't use cookies to collect and store individually-identifiable information. You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.</p>

<p>In addition, we allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect  certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may be placing and reading  cookies in the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk or using  web beacons or other technologies to collect information in the course of ads  being served on this website.&nbsp; These companies  may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream  information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or  scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater  interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web  beacon to collect this information. To opt-out of this type of advertising, you  can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> or follow the instructions for opting out provided in the third party ad  servers’ privacy and data protection policies. &nbsp;The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is  subject to their own privacy and data protection policies and is not covered by  our privacy policy. Wiley does not take responsibility for the privacy policies  of, and usage of, personal information collected by others including, without  limitation, those of any partner or affiliate. </p>

<h2 class="content-title">What information does Wiley collect when users purchase products on this Web site?</h2>
<p>If users purchase a product or products on CliffsNotes.com, they are required to provide their name, billing and/or mailing address information, an e-mail address, a phone number, and a valid credit card number with expiration date and security code. For additional information about our shopping cart, please visit the <a href="/Section/Ordering-CliffsNotes-Books.id-305479.html">"ordering" area of the CliffsNotes.com help section</a>.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">What information does Wiley collect when users subscribe to CliffsTips, this Web site's free e-mail newsletter service? How can users unsubscribe to CliffsTips?</h2>
<p>Users over 13 years of age may voluntarily sign up for CliffsTips, this Web site's free e-mail newsletter service, by providing their own name and e-mail address. Any user who subscribes to our CliffsTips will always be given a clear opportunity to unsubscribe. An "unsubscribe" link will appear in every CliffsTip e-mail that they receive. If users who under age 13 choose to sign up for CliffsTips, they must provide their name, e-mail address, and the e-mail address of a parent or guardian. That parent or guardian will be notified that the under-13 user has signed up for CliffsTips and also will have the option of unsubscribing their child.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">If a user signs up for CliffsTips, will their e-mail information be shared with any third parties?</h2>
<p>Only with the user's permission. Wiley occasionally informs CliffsTips subscribers of interesting specials, products, and services we believe users will appreciate; these opportunities may be provided by our own companies or third parties. We will only send you such notices if you indicate your interest in the checkbox on our CliffsTips subscription page.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">What information is collected when a user submits an answer to a CliffsNotes.com poll question?</h2>
<p>Our CliffsNotes.com poll is a voluntary feature that is provided to entertain and inform our users. Poll responses will not be saved or identified with the individual users who posted them. Only the overall results and percentages that are tallied by our poll engine may be analyzed internally or occasionally shared with third parties.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">What information is collected when a user submits a question to "Ask Cliff"?</h2>
<p>"Ask Cliff" is a voluntary feature that allows our site visitors to send in questions about studying, taking tests, and getting through school. When users submit questions to "Ask Cliff," they are required to provide their names and e-mail addresses along with their questions. The user's name and e-mail information is not shared with anyone except for the Wiley editorial team who reviews and answers select questions. Not all submitted questions will be answered. Some questions and answers will be posted to our "Ask Cliff" page or used as testimonials (such as in advertisements or catalogs), but these postings never identify the person who submitted the question — either by name or e-mail address. Wiley can make use of "Ask Cliff" questions and any other material submitted, including without limitation in promotional materials. Although users under 13 may submit questions to "Ask Cliff," their questions as written will never be posted publicly on the "Ask Cliff" page.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">What information is collected when a user submits a query to CliffsNotes or Wiley customer care?</h2>
<p>Users who wish to make inquiries about our products, our Web site, their order or purchase from CliffsNotes.com, and any other matter related to CliffsNotes or CliffsNotes.com may do so via this Web site's <a href="/go/contact_us">Contact Us</a> area. area. The online form that is reviewed by our customer care representatives requires that users submit their names, e-mail addresses, and query details. This information is not shared with anyone except for pertinent Wiley representatives.</p>

<p>Users who wish to receive technical support for any interactive Wiley products, are required to register with the Wiley Customer Support Web site by providing their name, e-mail address, and password. They are then required to submit their question for a technical support online form that is reviewed by our technical support staff representatives. The information provided by the user is not shared with anyone except for pertinent Wiley representatives.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">Once Wiley has the user-specific information that is collected via all of the aforementioned channels, what happens to it?</h2>

<p>Wiley may disclose to carefully chosen third parties navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics (including "page views" on this website and the products herein) and demographics but only in forms that do not reveal a User's identity or confidential information, except as required by law, as needed in connection with legal proceedings, or unless we have received your consent.</p>
