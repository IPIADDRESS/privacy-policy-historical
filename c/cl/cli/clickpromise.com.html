    <p class="bodytext">Given  the ever increasing exchange of information and materials in today’s  internet world, we are extremely sensitive to privacy issues especially  when it comes to children. Therefore, we are especially careful in any  communications involving children and their families. We do not  knowingly collect any information whatsoever from children 13 and  under. We do not verify the age of any registrant and simply rely on  the veracity of any registrant when such registrant provides us with  information. Consequently, if you are uncomfortable with this lack of  verification procedures, we urge you to not register with us or on any  of our sites. We treat any child over the age of 13, as disclosed to us  in the registration process, the same way as we treat all other  registrants. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's on-line activities. </p>
