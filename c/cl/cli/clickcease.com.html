What's even more interesting is that google has become far more proactive about crediting false clicks to my account since I've signed up to your services. Previous to your ervice, I was being charged for everything and anything, literally $***s of dollars per month of false clicks from people who would spend 0 seconds on my site and bounce 100% of the time. Now with your product, google has been wiping the false clicks and my budget has gone solely on actual customers! What a difference that makes to my business. I will definitely be continuing with your services",

        If you've been dealing with fraudulent clicks on your Adword, Bing, etc, ads, I highly recommend ClickCease as a safety net that will definitely catch the considerable number of bad clicks that Google can't.

Clickcease lets you easily prevent unwanted clicks by blocking suspicious IP addresses.you can block IP's automatically or manually with an easy, straightforward user interface. It also shows every IP address from which somebody clicked on your ads, how many times they clicked, from which browser, operating system and more. All this time you can talk to a representative through an online chat. They gave me the info I asked for and helped me set everything needed with a lot of patience. Highly recommended!",

        -'Block IPs for a certain period' has a max of 90 days. Again, as a low volume campaign I'd like the ability to set this to up to 180 days if possible.
        Overall: I love the tool. It's just not realistic to look up all the IP's that click on your ads and this helped eliminate my manual process of counting IP's and banning multi-clickers with no conversions. Real time and money saver. It's also great because I only have to maintain one banned IP list instead of going into each campaign.",
