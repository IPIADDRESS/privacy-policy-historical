<p>We collect, retain and process Personal Information about Users in order to provide our Services and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We collect Personal Information when you:</p>

<h4>Other Information; Cookies</h4>

<p>We use cookies (small data files stored on your computer by your web browser upon visiting a website), web beacons, and similar technologies to operate our services efficiently and as intended. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. Through such technologies, we gather information about you, such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, mobile device identification number, the sites visited before and after our Site, and about your interactions with our services, such as the time and date when you viewed a page, which advertisements you have clicked on, and whether you filled out an online form.</p>

<p>We use information gathered through these tools to improve the way our Sites work, for example by employing third-party analytics tools which aggregate anonymous user information to help us better design our sites and enhance the functionality of our services for example, by remembering preferences or other choices that you make - such as user names, language preferences, and the like – we can better understand how you use our site(s) over time. In short, these tools allow us to provide you with a better, more relevant online experience. We may also work with third-party advertising companies to suggest advertisements from the services or on third-party sites based on your preferences.</p>

<p>You may set your browser to block all cookies, including HMP and its subsidiaries while using our services, but doing so will prevent some aspects of our services to not function properly). You may also set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow first-party cookies, which would allow us (but not third parties) to collect such information while you are on our sites. In addition, some browsers may allow you to block certain web beacons and similar tracking codes. Please refer to your browser’s documentation if you wish to block some or all cookies, web beacons, and/or similar tools. To find out more about cookies, including how to manage and delete cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<h4>Third Party Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h4>

<p>Like many other organizations, we may use outside marketing companies to place and monitor advertisements or links on our websites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (links clinked on during a visit, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked on or scrolled over) and personally identifiable information (e.g., NPI number) during your visits to our websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services likely to be of interest to you.</p>

<p>Certain third parties may also employ cookies, web beacons, and/or similar technologies on our Services. Information collected through such third-party tools is gathered directly by such third party, not by HMP or its subsidiaries, and is subject to such third party's applicable privacy policy. Neither HMP nor its subsidiaries has any control over such third-party tools. These third parties include, but are not limited to, analytics partners who help us better understand how our users are interacting with our Services and advertising, providers of widgets and other third-party applications that may appear in our Services, ad servers, ad networks, ad agencies, and advertisers. As noted above, you may set your browser to block third-party cookies.</p>
