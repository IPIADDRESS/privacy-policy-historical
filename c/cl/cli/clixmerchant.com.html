We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP", "END", or "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each offering.</p>

			<p>We awarded our first $10,000 Scholarship in 2005.  In the years that followed, we've continued to award a new winner every
month.  Today, we've awarded over $750,000 in scholarships, and we're still going strong.  How do we do this?  We partner with colleges and universities focused on continuing education programs that provide graduates with real opportunities for career advancement.  This allows us to continue awarding the scholarship every month.  Thank you for visiting and good luck!</p><p>
