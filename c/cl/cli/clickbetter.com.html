ClickBetter.com has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy also provides that ClickBetter.com will use appropriate contractual means to establish a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for processing by third parties on ClickBetter.com behalf.<br><br>

<strong>4. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information</strong><br>

<strong>ClickBetter.com collects and uses personal information for the following purposes:</strong><br><br>

ClickBetter.com also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational, marketing and other promotional purposes. If we hire other companies to provide some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and we will limit their rights to use and further disclose your personal information as appropriate in the course of their work for us.
<br><br>
<strong>5. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>

ClickBetter.com limits its collection of personal information to only that information which is necessary for the Identified Purposes. ClickBetter.com does not direct its site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen.<br><br>

When you visit the ClickBetter.com web site, a cookie may be placed on your computer or the cookie may be read if you have visited the ClickBetter.com site previously. ClickBetter.com uses cookies to allow ClickBetter.com to determine which products and services you have already purchased so that ClickBetter.com does not provide redundant information to you, and, if you are an ClickBetter.com affiliate, to track ClickBetter.com sales made to customers referred by you so that you can receive compensation under our affiliate program. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the ClickBetter.com web site, you may not be able to view all the text on the screens, or to experience a personalized visit, or to subscribe to certain service and product offerings on the ClickBetter.com site.<br><br>

<strong>6. Disclosure, Processing and Retention</strong><br>

From time to time, ClickBetter.com may disclose certain personally identifiable information with affiliated business partners or authorized third parties on a need to know basis for evaluating authorized customers for service eligibility. With exception to the above, ClickBetter.com does not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to anyone else, except:<br><br>


<ul>

<li>to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 2, above);</li>

<li> to ClickBetter.com employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on ClickBetter.com behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;</li>

<li> as necessary if ClickBetter.com has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with ClickBetter.com rights or property, other users of ClickBetter.com web site, products or services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and</li>

<li> to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.</li>

In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ClickBetter.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.<br><br>

Your information may be stored and processed in the United Kingdom, or in any other country in which ClickBetter.com or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.<br><br>

After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from our database), ClickBetter.com will keep your personal information in its archives. Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove ClickBetter.com compliance with any applicable law.<br><br>

<strong>7. Accuracy of Personal Information</strong><br>

ClickBetter.com will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information.

ClickBetter.com will use new or updated personal information it receives from customers to update its own records.
<br><br>
<strong>8. Security Safeguards</strong><br>

ClickBetter.com will use reasonable efforts to protect customers’ personal information.<br><br>

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you submit a request, place a transaction or access your personal information.<br><br>

These security measures include: password protected directories and databases to safeguard your information, SSL (Secure Sockets Layered) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely or PCI Scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other vulnerabilities.
<br><br>
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.<br><br>

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.<br><br>

<br><br>

If ClickBetter.com is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customer’s personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial information or attorney–client privileged communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual.
<br><br>
