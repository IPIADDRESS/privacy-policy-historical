ClickBetter.com will notify customers by email of changes to  this policy that will affect information collected from them in the future. In  certain circumstances, however, ClickBetter.com will not inform and obtain the  consent of the customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a  breach of an agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life,  health or security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or  in compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order.</p>

With exception to the above,  ClickBetter.com does not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to  anyone else, except:</p>
      <p align="left">(a) to someone you have designated to act  as your agent, for one or more of the Identified Purposes (listed in Section 2,  above);</p>
      <p align="left">(b) to ClickBetter.com employees,  independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, consultants, business  associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, acting on ClickBetter.com  behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;</p>
      <p align="left">(c) as necessary if ClickBetter.com has  reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring  legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference  (either intentionally or unintentionally) with ClickBetter.com rights or  property, other users of ClickBetter.com web site, products or services, or  anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and</p>
      <p align="left">(d) to respond to judicial process and  provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an  investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or  otherwise as required by law. </p>
      <p align="left">In addition, as we continue to develop our  business, we or our affiliates may sell or buy other businesses or entities, or  we may merge with another company. In such transactions, personal information  may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that  ClickBetter.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal  information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
      <p align="left">Your information may be stored and  processed in the United Kingdom, or in any other country in which  ClickBetter.com or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities.  By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside  of your country. </p>
      <p align="left">After your account becomes inactive (that  is, if you request to be removed from our database), ClickBetter.com will keep  your personal information in its archives. Your information will then be used  only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove ClickBetter.com compliance with  any applicable law. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>7. Accuracy of Personal Information</strong></p>
      <p align="left">ClickBetter.com will use reasonable efforts  to keep customer personal information accurate for the Identified Purposes, and  for minimizing the possibility of making inappropriate customer decisions based  on such information. Customers are responsible for informing ClickBetter.com  about changes to their personal information. You can do this by contacting us  at the information below. ClickBetter.com will use new or updated personal  information it receives from customers to update its own records. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>8. Security Safeguards</strong></p>
      <p align="left">ClickBetter.com will use reasonable efforts  to protect customersâ€™ personal information.</p>
      <p align="left">We implement a variety of security measures  to maintain the safety of your personal information when you submit a request,  place an order or access your personal information. <br>
          <br>
        These security measures include: password protected directories and databases  to safeguard your information, SSL (Secure Sockets Layered) technology to  ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet  securely or PCI Scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other  vulnerabilities. <br>
  <br>
        We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information  is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into  our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those  authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep  the information confidential.<br>
  <br>
        After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security  numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>

      <p align="left">If ClickBetter.com is not able to provide  access to some aspect of a customerâ€™s personal information, it will provide  reasons for denying access such as; that by doing so would likely reveal  personal information about a third party, or that it is confidential commercial  information or attorneyâ€“client privileged communications, or that the  information relates to a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law, or  that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or  security of another individual.</p>
