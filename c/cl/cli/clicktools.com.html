<h4>1.&nbsp; How we collect your information:</h4>
This section gives you more information about what information we collect about you and how we collect it, whether we collect it directly from you or other sources.</div>

<p>How we collect and store information depends on the Site you visit, the activities in which you participate, and the Services you use. You can use some of the Services without providing any information, although several categories of information are automatically collected from you when you use the Services via the Site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When using the Services, we may collect and process the following information about you:</p>

<p><strong>Information provided directly by you</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Information (such as your name, company name, email address, postal address, telephone number and other contact details that you provide by completing forms on the Site or using the Service, including information about you if you register as a user of the Site or subscribe to a Service, information about you that you upload or submit to the Site or Service, or information you provide to us when requesting information or material from us;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Information and other details of any transactions made by you through the Site including but not limited to financial and billing information, including account numbers, billing name and address, birth year, credit card number, the total number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services and other financial-related information (‚ÄúBilling Information‚Äù) provided by you when making transactions through the Site or when using our Services;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Information contained in communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Site (or its content) or the Services;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Questionnaires and surveys. We may invite you to participate in questionnaires and surveys. These questionnaires and surveys will be generally designed in a way that they can be answered without any Personal Data. If you nonetheless enter Personal Data in a questionnaire or survey, we may use such Personal Data to improve its products and services</li>
	<li>Information from any employment materials you send us, for example, a CV, resum√© or other details of your employment history; or<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Other additional information that you provide to us when attending our corporate events.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information that we may collect from you when you use our Site</strong></p>

<p>We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or other devices that you use to access the Site or use the Services, including mobile devices, through commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons (see our <a href="#3">Cookies section here</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may also collect information when you access the Site or use our Services such as: (i) location information (as described in the next section below), unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s) such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (ii) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, error logs, and other similar information. If you do not want to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device; provided your device allows you to do this.</p>

<p>Creation of anonymized data sets. We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the use of the Site or the Services so that the information is not intended to identify you. We may anonymize Personal Data provided under this Privacy Policy to create anonymized data sets, which will then be used to improve its and its affiliates‚Äô products and services. This Policy does not restrict our use or disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information.</p>

<p><strong>Information about you collected from third parties</strong></p>

<p>We may process your personal information that we have either obtained from you, or obtained from somewhere else. Personal information which is not collected directly from you may be collected:</p>

<ul>
	<li>From your employer in connection with your job and how it relates to us.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you use any Site operated by us.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>From third parties we work closely with (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers). We will notify you when we receive information about you from them and the purposes for which we intend to use that information.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you access the Site or use the Services through a third-party connection or log-in, you authorize CallidusCloud to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Policy, any and all information available to CallidusCloud through the third-party interface.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="bordered" id="2">
<h4>2.&nbsp; How we use your information:</h4>

<p>Information is collected for the purposes stated in this Policy and will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>We will collect and use your information as described in this Policy and as permitted by applicable laws (including, if you are located in Australia, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles), including in circumstances where it is necessary: (i) to provide or fulfil Services requested by or for you; (ii) for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into such a contract; (iii) for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are a subject; (iv) to pursue our legitimate interests; or (v) where you have given us your express consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collect and use your information for the following purposes:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>To perform the Services requested by you</em>. For example, if you fill out a ‚ÄúContact Me‚Äù web form, we will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services. This data processing is necessary to provide or fulfil a service requested by or for you.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>To plan and host events</em>. For example, corporate events, host online forums and social networks in which event attendees may participate, and populate online profiles in relation to the Services. This data processing is necessary to provide or fulfil a service requested by or for you.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>For marketing purposes</em>. For example, we may use your information to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding CallidusCloud and our group companies and our partners such as information about promotions, events, products or services. We will only send you marketing communications and updates about our products, services and events with your prior consent, where required by law or otherwise in our legitimate interests provided these interests do not override your right to object to such communications. You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>In order to keep you up-to-date/request feedback</em>. Within an existing business relationship between you and us, we may inform you, where permitted in accordance with local laws, about its products or services (including webinars, seminars or events) which are similar or relate to such products and services you have already purchased or used from us. Furthermore, where you have attended a webinar, seminar or event of SAP or purchased products or services from us, we may contact you for feedback regarding the improvement of the relevant webinar, seminar, event, product or service.<br>
	<br>
	You can object to further marketing at any time by checking and updating your contact details within your account, or/and selecting the ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù link located on the bottom of CallidusCloud‚Äôs marketing emails. Additionally, you may send a request to <a href="mailto:SAP.CX.Legal-Privacy@sap.com">SAP.CX.Legal-Privacy@sap.com</a>.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	You have the right to contact us at any time to object to the further processing of your information for the purposes of direct marketing to you, including any profiling related to such marketing.</li>
	<li><em>For financial and payment purposes</em>. For example, for checking financial qualifications and collect payment from you, where applicable. This data processing is necessary to provide or fulfil a service requested by or for you.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>For operating and improving CallidusCloud‚Äôs Site and your customer experience</em>. For example, we may collect and analyze data on your use of our website and process it for the purpose of improving our online customer experience. Data collected could include data about your device, such as unique device identifiers, information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, and the state or country from which you accessed the Services. Data collected could also include information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks and domain names. This data allows us to understand our customers, their interaction with our website and improve our website to better serve our customers. We may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. Data processing for analytical and operational improvement purposes is a legitimate business interest.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>For security purposes</em>. For example, we may use your data to protect CallidusCloud and its third parties against security breaches and to prevent fraud and violation of CallidusCloud‚Äôs applicable agreements. Data processing for security purposes is a legitimate business interest.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>For hosting purposes</em>. For example, if you are our customer, we may collect and host your data to provide Services to you. If your employer is our customer, we may process your data in accordance with providing Services to them. However, we will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such data except as provided in a services agreement between us and our customer, or as may be required by law. Data processing for the purpose of hosting our Services is a legitimate business interest.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>For customizing the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features</em>. For example, if location-tracking on your mobile device shows you are close to a Callidus corporate event, we may reach out to you and let you know you should visit our nearby event. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. This data processing is necessary to provide or fulfil a service requested by or for you, and can be disabled by you. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Protection of CallidusCloud and Others</em>. For example, we may disclose your information to: (i) comply with legal obligations; (ii) enforce any agreements that you entered into with us; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (v) the extent necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects. We may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law. This is data processing for compliance with a legal obligation.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><em>Business Transfers</em>. For example, we reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your information, to a successor (or potential successor) company in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all, or components, of our business, or in connection with due diligence associated with any such transaction. Data processing for this purpose is a legitimate business interest.</li>

<h4>3.&nbsp; Cookies</h4>

<p>Our Site uses cookies and/or other similar technologies to enhance &amp; customise your user experience. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that enable us to remember your device, and which can be used to manage a range of features and content as well as storing searches and presenting personalised content.</p>
</div>

<p>We use this information to ensure the proper functioning and security of our Site and Services and to optimize our Site or Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do we collect cookies and other technologies&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This section describes our practices with respect to how we use cookies. By using our Services with your browser set to accept cookies, you are consenting to our use of cookies in the manner described herein.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may collect data about your use of the Services through the use of cookies, Internet server logs, tracking pixels (also called web beacons) and similar technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, that enables us to recognize your computer/device, store your preferences and settings, enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform searches and analytics, and assist with security administrative functions. An Internet server log is a file where website activity is stored. Server logs are used to track usage and provide security. A tracking pixel, which is also referred to as a web beacon or a clear GIF, is an electronic tag with a unique identifier that is embedded on webpages, in online advertisements and/or email. These pixels are designed to provide usage information, such as advertising impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and access user cookies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What types of cookies do we use?</strong></p>

<p><em>Third party cookies</em><br>
We use third parties to assist us in advertising, tracking aggregated and/or de-identified site usage statistics, and providing content-sharing services to support the Services. These third parties may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect similar information about your use of the Services. For instance, the cookies may reflect de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., a hashed version of your email address, which we may share with service providers, solely in non-human readable form. We do not control these third-party technologies, and their use is governed by those parties‚Äô privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site or use the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Session and persistent cookies</em><br>
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to our site. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using our Services. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in. Another type of cookies is Flash cookies, which are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files and help in the viewing of content that uses the Adobe Flash player.</p>

<p>We use these cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in some cases, where required by law, where you have consented to their use&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Why does CallidusCloud use cookies and similar technologies?</strong></em> CallidusCloud uses cookies and similar technologies for the following purposes:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Authentication and Security</strong>: To log you into the Services; to protect your security; and to help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate CallidusCloud‚Äôs Website Terms and Conditions, which can be found <a href="/website-terms-and-conditions">here</a>. For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to the Services and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through the Services.&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Preferences</strong>: To remember information about your browser and your preferences; and to remember your settings and other choices you have made.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Analytics and Research</strong>: To help us better understand how people use our Services, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics; and to help us improve and understand how people use the Services. For example, cookies help us test different versions of our Services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your experience using the Services by using cookies to see how you interact with the Services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. To find out more about how Google uses data when you visit a website that uses Google Analytics, please visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Personalized Content</strong>: To customize the Services with more relevant content.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Advertising</strong>: To provide you with more relevant advertising. As explained below, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may use cookies to collect information about your activities on the Services, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads. Targeting and advertising cookies on the Services may include Google and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a> &nbsp;or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will not be tailored to your interests.&nbsp;</li>

If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from CallidusCloud, CallidusCloud may share information about you collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). If you do not want your information to be shared in this manner, you may email SAP.CX.Legal-Privacy@sap.com. However, we do not control our business partners‚Äô use of the information that we share with them about you that we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Data About Attendees: CallidusCloud does not share Data About Attendees with business partners unless: (i) you specifically opt in to such sharing via an event registration form; or (ii) you attend a CallidusCloud event and have your attendee badge scanned by a business partner.

	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Business Transfers: We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your information, including, without limitation, your information, to a successor (or potential successor) company in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all, or components, of our business, or in connection with due diligence associated with any such transaction.&nbsp;<br>

	<li>California Do Not Track Disclosure. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services that is shared with third parties, and that is why we provide the opt-out choices set forth in this Policy. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track (‚ÄúDNT‚Äù) signals, in part because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators, nor is there a consistent standard of interpreting user intent. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments in these areas.&nbsp;</li>
