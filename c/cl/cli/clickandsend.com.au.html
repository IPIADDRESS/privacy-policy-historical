        <p>Generally, Australia Post will collect personal information directly from you, and only to the extent necessary to provide an Australia Post product or service, including our agency functions, or to carry out our internal administrative operations.

        <h4>Direct marketing and your privacy </h4>
        <p>From time to time we may use the personal information we collect from you to identify particular Australia Post products and services which we believe may be of interest to you.

        <h4>Direct mail </h4>
        <p>Where we use your personal information to send you marketing information via the post we may do so with your implied consent or, if this is impracticable, we will ensure that you are provided with an opportunity to tick an "opt out" box to ensure you do not receive future such communications. By not ticking a clearly displayed "opt out" box, we will assume we have your implied consent to receive similar marketing communications in the future. We will always ensure that our opt out notices are clear, conspicuous and easy to take up.</p>
        <h4>Electronic marketing </h4>
        <p>Where we use your personal information to send you marketing information by e-mail, SMS, MMS or other electronic means we may do so with your express or implied consent. You may give us your express consent by, for example, ticking a box on an electronic or paper form where we seek your permission to send you electronic or other marketing information. Consent may be implied from our existing business relationship or where you have directly or indirectly provided us with your electronic address.</p>
        <p>All of our electronic marketing activities will comply with the requirements of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth).</p>
        <h4>Telemarketing </h4>
        <p>Australia Post usually does not engage in telemarketing activities to our consumer customers. Generally, such marketing is only ever used in relation to our business customers. Should any consumer telemarketing be done or authorised by Australia Post, will to the extent that it applies, comply with the:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth); </li>
            <li>Do Not Call Register (Consequential Amendments) Act 2006 (Cth); </li>

        <h4>Use of third party service providers </h4>
        <p>When we temporarily provide personal information to companies who perform services for us, such as specialist information technology companies, mail houses or other contractors to Australia Post we require those companies to protect your personal information as diligently as we do. Stringent contractual and other quality assurance measures are used to ensure your personal information is protected.</p>

        <p>We use cookies and other internet technologies to manage our website and certain online products and services. We do not use these technologies to collect or store personal information unless you have opted in to such a feature.</p>
        <p>Our internet server logs the following information which is provided by your browser for statistical purposes only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the type of browser and operating system you are using </li>
            <li>your Internet Service Provider and top level domain name (for example - .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc) </li>
            <li>the address of any referring web site (for example - the previous web site you visited), and </li>
            <li>your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address (a number which is unique to the machine through which you are connected to the internet) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this information is used by Australia Post for aggregated statistical analyses or systems administration purposes only. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities, except where required by or under law.</p>
        <h4>Cookies </h4>
        <p>A "cookie" is a packet of information that allows the Australia Post server (the computer that houses our web site) to identify and interact more effectively with your computer.</p>
        <p>When you access our web site, we send you a temporary or "<strong>session cookie</strong>" that gives you a unique identification number. A different identification number is sent each time you use our website. Cookies do not identify individual users, although they do identify a user's internet browser type and your Internet Service Provider. Shortly after you end your interaction with our web site, the cookie expires or "crumbles". This means it no longer exists on your computer and therefore cannot be used for further identification or access to your computer.</p>
        <p>Without cookies certain personalised services cannot be provided to users of our website, accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Australia Post website features if cookies have been disabled.</p>
        <h4>Cookie Policy</h4>
        <p>We use session cookies in the following manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log-on and log-off administration</strong> - If you decide to register with our site, so as, for example, to use one of our online services, session cookies help with the log-on and log-off process. The cookies enable us to recognize your log-on ID when you log on so that we do not establish a duplicate registration record for you. </li>
            <li><strong>Transactions and site usability</strong> - We use session cookies to improve how you navigate through our website and conduct transactions. As examples, session cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse over several pages; to store and prepopulate information so that you do not have to re-enter the same information twice. Session cookies may also be used to collect referral statistics when you click on a link or ad banner to or from auspost.com.au. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Australia Post may also use "<strong>persistent cookies</strong>". A persistent cookie is a small piece of text stored on your computer's hard drive for a defined period of time, after which the cookie is erased. Australia Post will not collect or link to personal information through persistent cookies without your express consent.</p>
        <p>We use persistent cookies as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Site usage measurement</strong> - Our site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our web site and its various components are used. It functions as a "visit cookie," so we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site. This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful. The cookie will expire 30 days after your last visit. </li>
            <li><strong>Log-off safety function</strong> - Australia Post uses a persistent cookie to automatically log you off of certain Australia Post sites if there has been no activity for 15 minutes. This is done for your safety to ensure that, if you have finished using our site but have forgotten to log off, no one else can use your computer via your log on and password. The cookie is permanently removed from your computer when you log off, or, if you have closed the browser without logging off, it is removed within 15 minutes from your last activity. </li>
            <li>
            <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Opt-in cookies</strong> - Persistent cookies allow us, at your request, to recognise you when you return to auspost.com,au or to remember certain information that you have provided us. The recognition feature allows you to log on to certain Australia Post sites automatically, without having to enter your name and password each visit. The cookie assigns a random number to you, which we link to personal information you have provided and your site activity. This allows us to personalise the site for you and tailor the content to your needs, for instance to show you banner ads about other products you may be interested in. </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions, such as package tracking numbers, or mailing or address lists, so we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits. These features and cookies are strictly at your request and for your convenience.</p>
        <p>We will also present you with a convenient way to remove the cookies, via where you manage your account, if you decide later that you want to terminate one or more of these functions. The cookies will expire one year from your last visit.</p>
        <h4>Cookie Management </h4>
        <p>You can configure your internet browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is sent. Please refer to your internet browser's instructions or help screens to learn more about these functions.</p>

        <h4>Links to other sites </h4>
        <p>The Australia Post site contains links to other sites. We are ultimately not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. We encourage you to read and understand the privacy policies on those websites prior to providing any information to them.</p>
        <p>Some of the content appearing on the Australia Post website may be supplied by third parties, for example, by framing third party web sites or the incorporation through "framesets" of content supplied by third party application service providers. In such cases Australia Post will ensure that our contractual arrangements with these third parties protect your personal information in compliance with privacy laws.</p>
        <h4>Searches </h4>
        <p>Search terms that you enter when using our search engine are collected, but are not associated with any other information that we collect. We use these search terms for the purpose of aggregated statistical analyses so we can ascertain what people are looking for on our website, and to improve the services that we provide.</p>
        <p>Also, from time to time, we may use external companies to provide us with detailed aggregate statistical analyses of our website traffic. At no time is any personal information made available to these companies, nor is the aggregate information ever merged with personal information such as your name, address, email address or other information you would consider sensitive or would compromise your privacy.</p>

Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place.</p>
        <p>For site security purposes and to ensure this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorised attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause us damage. Except for authorised law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Unauthorised modification or misuse of information stored in this system will be investigated and may result in criminal prosecution.</p>

        <p>Australia Post believes it is important to provide added protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate in and monitor their online activity. When we knowingly collect personal information from children, we ask only for the minimum information necessary to seek access to the information or service for which the child is requesting.</p>
        <h4>Collection of information from children </h4>
        <p>When knowingly collecting personal information from children we will give a notice specifying what information we are requesting, how we will use it, whether it will be shared with a third party, and a contact at Australia Post for questions. We will utilise the information only for the particular purpose for which it was given to us.</p>
        <h4>Obtaining Verifiable Parental Consent </h4>
        <p>We will use reasonable effort to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 16. The method of parental consent verification may vary according to the information, product, service or event in which the child wishes to participate.</p>
        <p>Means of obtaining such consent may include, but are not limited to, offline consent such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail or fax, or online consent such as by ticking an online check box that parental or guardian consent has been obtained.</p>
        <h4>When parental consent is not required </h4>
        <p>We do not require parental or guardian consent in order to collect and use online or offline contact information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>respond directly to a child's request on a one-off time basis, or to answer a specific request, where the information is not intended to be used to re-contact the child for other purposes </li>
            <li>request the name or on-line contact information of a parent/guardian for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification </li>
            <li>respond directly more than once to a specific request from a child and the information is not intended to be used to recontact the child beyond the scope of the request</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Parental review </h4>
        <p>Australia Post will allow parents or guardians to review any personal information collected from their children, subject to verifying the identity of the consenting parent/guardian.</p>
        <p>Parents/guardians may revoke their consent and delete information collected from their children at their discretion.</p>
