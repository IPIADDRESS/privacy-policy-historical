			<p class="bodytext">The Data Protection Act requires us to tell you how we collect and use data about you. You have the right to see the personal data we hold about you and change any incorrect information.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">We collect personal information about you from different sources including the details you provide through this website and over the telephone. This information will be needed to provide you with the service you have requested. When dealing with your request we may contact you by post, telephone, email and SMS text.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">We may need to disclose your personal information to third parties such as other members of the Tuscarora Group, other brokers, insurance companies and lenders in order to process any policy or loan you require. We may also provide your personal details to regulatory bodies if legally required to do so.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">Unless you ask otherwise, we will retain your details and may also send you emails about products and services that we can offer. We will always give you the choice of whether to opt out of these emails.</p>

The disclosure of multiple searches may adversely affect your credit profile and may make credit harder for you to obtain; information held about you by a credit reference agency may already be linked to records relating to another person, for example your spouse, and for the purpose of your loan application you will be treated as financially linked. Your loan application will be assessed with reference to all linked records;<br>
              * if you have confirmed you are linked financially with another person, you are declaring that you are entitled to (a) disclose information about that person and/or anyone else referred to by you and (b) that you authorise the broker and any lender involved in the application to search, link and/or record information at credit reference agencies about you and/or anyone else referred to by you.</p>
