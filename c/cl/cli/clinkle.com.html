        <span class="highlight">As we continue to improve our products and services, we may update our Privacy Policy.</span>
        If we make changes to this policy, we will update the effective date at the top of this document. A change in the effective date will serve as your notice that the policy has changed. If we make a substantial change to the policy, we will send you an email notification, provide you an alert to your mobile device or computer, or both. If you choose to continue using Clinkle’s products and services after receiving such notification, you agree to the revised privacy policy. You should review this Privacy Policy each time you use our mobile or website, as you will be bound by any changes once they are. Finally, we will provide previous Privacy Policies on our website, so you can see the changes we made.

        <span class="highlight">We primarily share your information so that you can find your friends, and they can find you.</span>
        As our products and services change over time, sharing data between users will lead to an increase in value on the platform. As an example, we will help connect you with trusted Clinkle Merchants if they are making an offer or providing a deal that we think will appeal to you based on your preferences and previous transactions.

        <span class="highlight">Although Clinkle works very hard to keep all of its users’ information secure, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</span>
        By enabling the screen lock on your phone and changing your passcode, PIN, and/or pattern frequently, you can reduce the risk of someone gaining access to your information. Similarly, keeping a strong email password and updating it from time to time will help prevent someone from gaining access to your account. Finally, we may, from time to time, provide links or portals to other websites or applications. Always be aware when you are leaving the Clinkle Services and entering another website or application, and be sure to review the relevant privacy policies of the other websites or applications.
