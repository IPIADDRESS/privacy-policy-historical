			<h1>ClickPotato Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p class="firstp"><i>Last Revision: January 2010</i></p>

			<p>blinkx, Inc., its affiliates, licensors and licensees, ("blinkx" or "we"), are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to any web site that references this Privacy Policy and is provided by blinkx ("Web site"), and to those blinkx-owned software products ("Software") made available to you from a Web site. Please see below for important information on third party software products made available from the Web sites. This Privacy Policy also governs information that you provide to us or that we learn from you when you use our Web sites and Software (collectively "Products"). When we collect your information from our Products, we will tell you how we may collect, use, and, in some instances, share this information.</p>

			<h3>What We Collect and Use</h3>

			<h5>Cookies.</h5>
			<p>By accessing any Web site, blinkx may place cookies on your hard drive. blinkx uses cookies to enable you to sign in to certain services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Some cookies are used only to assist you with your session on a Web site – such cookies expire automatically after you terminate your session. blinkx also uses cookies to improve the sign-in experience on certain Web sites. For example, your user ID may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. Finally, blinkx may place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when an advertisement for that sponsor is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the effectiveness of that advertisement. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the domain that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of a Web site that depend on cookies.</p>

			<h5>User-Provided Information.</h5>
			<p>In order to utilize the services at some Web sites you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information ("PII"), such as account information (user name and password), credit card information (card type, account number, expiration date, and billing address), banking information (Swift/ABA routing number, account number, bank name and address), PayPal email, email address, IM user ID, name and company name, tax identification number, and home or work address and telephone number, as well as certain demographic information such as city, state, country and zip code. blinkx uses your PII to deliver the services you have requested and to communicate with you, including certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from blinkx. All such information is provided voluntarily by you. If you provide a friend’s email address to blinkx for the "refer-a-friend" feature, we use that email address only for the purpose of sending your friend the email you requested. No PII is utilized by blinkx for the purpose of displaying advertisements or for profiling. blinkx does not sell, rent or lease PII to third parties.</p>

			<h5>Software.</h5>
			<p>In order to use Software, you may be asked to provide certain information. For messenger Software products, requested information may include IM account information (screen names and passwords) and personal information (including your email address, date of birth, gender, and primary language). For desktop tool Software products, requested information may include your astrological sign, zip code, TV service provider, type of service, and channel line-up. All such information is provided voluntarily by you. No such information is utilized by blinkx for the purpose of displaying advertisements or profiling. blinkx does not sell, rent or lease such information to third parties.</p>
			<p>Our Software product automatically collects information from you to enable the Software’s services. By installing the Software, you authorize blinkx to periodically collect certain information, such as (1) keywords and portions of Web site addresses or complete URLs from the Web sites you visit and upload this information to our servers so that we may display targeted advertisements to you while you are connected to the Internet; and (2) button impressions and clicks from the Toolbar products in your web browser and/or email application and upload this information to our servers so that we may enhance the content offered to you. The Software does not collect, store, or use PII, and blinkx does not receive PII, as a result of your use of this Software.</p>

			<h5>Third Party Software.</h5>
			<p>Included with the Software may be third party software from a blinkx partner. Your registration for and use of any third party software is subject to that third party’s privacy policy, if any. If you register for or use third party software, both blinkx and the third party software provider will receive any information collected by blinkx in conjunction with your registration, and only blinkx’s use of your information is subject to this Privacy Policy. To determine how a blinkx partner may use your registration information, or may otherwise independently be collecting other information through your use of third party software, please refer to the third party software provider’s privacy policy.</p>

			<h5>Third Party Collection.</h5>
			<p>The Software will display to you targeted web sites and/or advertisements that are hosted by third parties ("Third Party Hosted Advertisements").
