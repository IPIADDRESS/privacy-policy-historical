<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Clientflow collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Clientflows’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Clientflows’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Clientflow may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Clientflow also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blog. Clientflow only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Clientflow’s websites choose to interact with Clientflow in ways that require Clientflow to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Clientflow gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up on Clientflow.io to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Clientflow – by purchasing a monthly subscription to Clientflow, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Clientflow collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Clientflow. Clientflow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Clientflow may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Clientflow may monitor the most popular parts of http://clientflow.io. Clientflow may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Clientflow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Clientflow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Clientflow’s behalf or to provide services available at Clientflow’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Clientflow’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Clientflow will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Clientflow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Clientflow believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Clientflow, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Clientflow website and have supplied your email address, Clientflow may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Clientflow. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Clientflow takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Clientflow uses cookies to help Clientflow identify and track visitors, their usage of Clientflow website, and their website access preferences. Clientflow visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Clientflow’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Clientflow’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>



<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Clientflow may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Clientflow’s sole discretion. Clientflow encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
