In any instance where non-mandatory information is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection. Clickatell makes every practical effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of information. If you believe that our website has collected excessive information, we encourage you to contact our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:legal@clickatell.com">legal@clickatell.com</a> to raise any concerns.

We request that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you do wish to provide sensitive information for any reason, you explicitly consent to our use of that information in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this information.</span> <br><br> <span>We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy especially in an online environment.

By way of example, contact information about visitors to our website (such as information generated though registration for access to areas on the site) will be retained as long as the information is required to completely service the contact request or until a user requests that we delete that information. Mailing list information, discussion posts and email are kept for the period of time considered reasonable to facilitate the visitor’s requests. Resumes are disposed of when they are either no longer under consideration, or are considered outdated by our Human Resources departments.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Security:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect personal information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. We make use of electronic and computer safeguards such as firewalls. We have physical and electronic access control to our buildings.</span> <br><br> <span>All Clickatell employees follow a network-wide security policy in terms whereof we only authorise access. Only authorised Clickatell personnel are provided access to personal information and these employees have agreed contractually to ensure confidentiality of this information. Clickatell’s policy is to use secure socket layer technology for our customer’s administration area in order to protect information submitted through web forms.</span> <br><br> <span>We are committed to ensure your personal information is kept secure and confidential and not kept for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which we collected it.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Right to request access and changes to personal information:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>If any of your personal information changes, you must let us know immediately by updating your Clickatell account or contacting our Support team at <a href="mailto:support@clickatell.com">support@clickatell.com</a>.</span> <br><br> <span><span>Subject to applicable law, you have the right of access to personal information you have submitted to Clickatell. Clickatell is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to visitors to allow them the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccuracies.

</ul>
<p><span><br><br> <span class="deck">Use of information:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Personal information obtained through our website will be used for the intended purpose stated at the time that the information is collected or for purposes as set out in this policy.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Marketing:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Except for the mailing list initiative described above, where you explicitly choose to receive specific Clickatell marketing or other materials, Clickatell will not use personal information collected from our websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities.

Clickatell will not sell your personal information obtained through the website.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Cookies:</span> Cookies may be used on some pages of our website. “Cookies” are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing a more customised website experience. For example, a cookie can be used to store registration information in an area of our website site so that you do not need to re-enter it on subsequent visits to that area. It is Clickatell’s policy to use cookies to make navigation of our websites easier for visitors and to facilitate efficient registration procedures. Website statistics are compiled by Clickatell and used for statistical reporting only. If you are concerned about cookies, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. In most cases, you may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our websites; however other functionality in our website may be impaired. After termination of your visit to our website, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Log files:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In order to properly manage our website we may anonymously log information on our operational systems, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters. This is to ensure that our website presents the best web experience for visitors and is an effective information resource.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Display advertising:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our website and sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your visits to our website and the sites upon which we advertise, to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, unique third-party cookies may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we may use web beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server, on our behalf or on behalf of our agent, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to our website. Our third-party ad server is performing its functions on our behalf or on behalf of our agent, and we may, directly or indirectly, instruct such ad server to enable other service providers to receive information about our site related to our online advertising.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Email advertising:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>We share web site usage information about visitors to our web site, who have consented to and received a targeted promotional campaign, with a reputable third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeted future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Third party links:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>There are several places throughout our website that may link to other websites that do not operate under our privacy practices. When you link to other websites, Clickatell’s privacy practices no longer apply. We encourage you to review each non-Clickatell website’s privacy policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information as the non-Clickatell website’s privacy policy will regulate the use of your personal information when you make use of those sites.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Login:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>As a policy, visitors are not required to register to gain access to areas of the Clickatell’s websites. In certain cases in the future, as your Clickatell website experience expands, we may require visitors to register in order to obtain a user-id and password for authentication and secure access to a transaction or certain business confidential or proprietary information services on premium websites.</span> <br><br> <span class="deck">Unsubscribe:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You voluntarily provide us with personal information.
