          <p align="left">How you can change the information</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">This policy addresses our practices with respect to our 
        website, but does not address the practices of any website we link to 
        (including the merchants and content providers we link to). This policy 
        is incorporated into, and subject to the terms of, our User Agreement. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>How We Use Information collected</b><br>
        We use information which you provide us to keep track of the Clickatell 
        services you have signed up to receive. We may also use personally identifiable 
        information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, 
        to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product 
        offerings and to customize our site's content and layout. We do this in 
        an attempt to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' 
        needs. We may also use personally identifiable information about you to 
        deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, 
        such as targeted banners and promotions. We use your email address to 
        contact you regarding administrative notices or latest news from time 
        to time. We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other 
        information we obtain from your current and past activities on the site, 
        to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms and Conditions. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Disclosure of Your Information</b><br>
        We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you 
        to any third party. We do aggregate personally identifiable information 
        and disclose such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other 
        marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do 
        not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally 
        identify you. Clickatell offers features on our site where we will by 
        necessity, need to provide some of your information to the third party 
        offering such services. To the extent that that third party requires your 
        information to enable you to use their service, we will notify you of 
        the specific information that will be provided to such third parties. 
        Before you use the service you should evaluate whether you will accept 
        the terms and conditions of the third party service, and give Clickatell 
        the right to pass your information on to that third party. In addition, 
        we must comply with court orders, information requests from government 
        agencies and regulators and other legal and regulatory processes that 
        may require the disclosure of your personally-identifiable information. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>
        <u>Will you send advertising messages to my cell phone, without my consent 
        ?</u><br>
        No, we will not send you unwanted advertising messages. We may initiate 
        a program whereby we send advertising messages to cell phones. However, 
        this will be an opt-in based service. You will decide if, and when you 
        want to receive advertising on your cell phone. </p>
      <p align="left"><u>I am getting spammed on my cell phone. What's happening 
        ?</u><br>
        One of the services, provided by Clickatell, allows visitors and members 
        to send messages to friends, family, colleagues, using the Clickatell 
        Interface. The Clickatell Interface conditions of use forbid spamming 
        to cell phone users and several software filters are in place to block 
        spammers. However, we cannot guarantee that no spamming will ever occur. 
        You have the possibility to block your phone from receiving any message 
        from Clickatell or Clickatell members by clicking on the 'do-not-disturb' 
        button on the home page. </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Reviewing/Changing Your Information</b><br>
        If at any time you would like to change any information in your account, 
        either as a Desktop Client User go and change your personal preferences 
        from the system tray, or as a host client, go to Member Login from the 
        home page. Here you can change or update your information. You must click 
        Change Details to maintain new changes. </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Limits on Our Abilities</b><br>
        Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal 
        and technical environment, we cannot ensure that your personally identifiable 
        information will not be disclosed to third parties in ways not described 
        in this policy. Additionally, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose 
        any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other 
        government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary 
        or appropriate to address or resolve inquiries or problems. </p>
