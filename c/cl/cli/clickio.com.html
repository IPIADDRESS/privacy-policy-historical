This Privacy Policy constitutes an integral part of the Advertising Services Offer Agreement governing your relationship with the Operator (the "<strong>Offer Agreement</strong>") and is a legally binding agreement between the Internet user accepting the terms of the Offer Agreement and this Privacy Policy ("<strong>You</strong>") and the Operator governing collection, processing, storing and use of your personally identifiable information and other personal data required for you using and/or related to your use of the Clickio Platform, and its provisions may be enforced against you under applicable law. Please read and review this Privacy Policy before submitting any personal data to or with help of the Clickio Platform. By submitting any personal data to or with help of the Clickio Platform, or otherwise accessing or using the Clickio Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy without limitation. This Privacy Policy is subject to change; please review the Privacy Policy each time you access and/or use the Clickio Platform. By submitting any personal data to or with help of the Clickio Platform, or otherwise accessing or using the Clickio Platform, you shall be deemed as having accepted the most recent version of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of collection, processing, storing and use of your personally identifiable information and other personal data set forth in this Privacy Policy, you may not submit any personal data to or with help of the Clickio Platform, or otherwise access or use this Clickio Platform in any way. </p> 

<h2>COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>

<p>In certain instances of using the Clickio Platform discussed below, you may be prompted by the Clickio Platform to provide information about you that may identify you (your "<strong>Personal Data</strong>"). Personal Data submitted by you through and with help of the Clickio Platform and collected from you via the Clickio Platform may include the following information: </p>

<ul>
	<li>your valid e-mail address;</li> 
	<li>your valid account with a messaging/communication service such as Skype, ICQ or similar services (if you have said account); and</li>
	<li>other information from which an individual may be personally identified that may be required by the Operator and prompted for submitting from time to time via the Clickio Platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>You agree that the Operator may collect your Personal Data in certain instances, such as, but not limited to: </p>

<ul>
	<li>when you register your personal profile within the Clickio Platform;</li> 
	<li>when you order Services as they are defined in the Offer Agreement via the Clickio Platform;</li> 
	<li>when you contact the Operator by e-mail;</li>
	<li>when you otherwise use the functionality of the Clickio Platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>You agree that all Personal Data you provide via the Clickio Platform must and will be correct, truthful, current, and complete. Providing false information about your identity is forbidden. If the Operator believes that the Personal Data you provide is not correct, current, or complete, or is false or misleading, the Operator has the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the Clickio Platform or any of its resources and to suspend or terminate your personal profile at any time.</p>

<p>You hereby agree that if you do not want the Operator and/or its designated Personal Data processing contractor to collect, process, store and/or use any of your Personal Data, you may not or will not be able to use certain functionality of the Clickio Platform, order Services via the Clickio Platform, or use those sections or modules of the Clickio Platform that require or may require your Personal Data in accordance with their designated purpose.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL DATA OF CHILDREN AND TEENS</h2>

<p>The Clickio Platform is intended for use by adults only. The Operator and its designated Personal Data processing contractor (if applicable) do not knowingly collect, process, store, use or disclose Personal Data of children younger than 13 years of age and teens aged between 13 and 18 years of age. </p>

<p>To use the Clickio Platform and submit your Personal Data, you must be both (1) at least 18 (eighteen) years of age, and (2) of legal age in the jurisdiction from which you access and use the Clickio Platform. Any use by you of the Clickio Platform shall be deemed to constitute your conformance with this requirement. </p>

<p>The Operator reserves the right to report attempts of use of the Clickio Platform by the minors to the appropriate authorities.</p>

<p>If the Operator has learned or has sufficient grounds to believe that Personal Data is submitted by a child or a teen instead of an adult, the Operator reserves the right to suspend the personal profile through which the Personal Data was submitted and request provision of an e-mail address of the parent or legal guardian of the submitting person so that the Operator can notify the parent or legal guardian that their child or teen has provided Personal Data through the Clickio Platform and provide an opportunity for the parent or legal guardian to request the deletion of that Personal Data from the relevant records. The Operator will contact the parent or legal guardian at the e-mail address provided and the parent or legal guardian will have 48 hours from delivery of the e-mail to advise who exactly submitted the Personal Data. If the parent or legal guardian fails to reply to the query sent to the provided e-mail address, the Operator will assume that the parent or legal guardian has not consented to collection and processing of their child’s or teen’s Personal Data, after which the related personal profile will be immediately terminated and the Personal Data in question will be purged from Operator’s and/or its designated Personal Data processing contractor’s records. </p>
