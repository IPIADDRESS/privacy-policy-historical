Personal information may include your name, email, 				mailing and/or business address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you 				personally. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to visit our website.			</p>			<p>				Key aspects of our privacy policy include:				</p><ul>					<li>We do not sell or rent your personal information to outside parties.</li>					<li>We do not market other products or services to you without your consent.</li>					<li>We do not use web analysis tools (e.g., cookies) to identify you personally without your express consent.</li>				</ul>			<p></p>			<p>				<strong>Notice of our privacy practices</strong>				<br><br>				<strong>The following describes the ways we collect information from you, and the protections that apply to your information.</strong>			</p>			<p>				Click2Mail collects personal information from you and from your transactions with us. We use 				information we collect to provide you certain products and services, and if needed to respond 				to your inquiries or requests for information. We occasionally collect data about you from 				financial entities to perform verification services and from commercial sources. We do this, 				for example, to prepopulate data fields in call centers to facilitate transactions, or to market 				products to consumers who have agreed to receive such messages.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Privacy Act Rights</strong>			</p>			<p>				Click2Mail follows the privacy requirements of the Privacy Act, which protects your personal 				information that we maintain in what is called a system of records. A system of records is a 				file, database, or program from which personal information is retrieved by name or other 				personal identifier. In other words, the Privacy Act applies when we use your personal 				information to know who you are and to interact with you - such as when you provide information 				to request a product or service, register on www.click2mail.com, or submit an inquiry or 				complaint. The Privacy Act provides comprehensive protections for your personal information. 				This includes how information is collected, used, disclosed, stored, and discarded.			</p>			<p>				When we collect and maintain personal information from you offline, a Privacy Act notice 				will be provided. The following is your Privacy Act notice for personal information collected online:			</p>			<p>				Privacy Act notice: Your information will be used to provide you requested products, services, or 				information. Collection is authorized by 39 USC 401, 403, &amp; 404. Providing the information is voluntary, 				but if not provided, we may not process your transaction. We do not disclose your information to third 				parties without your consent, except to facilitate the transaction, to act on your behalf or request, 				or as legally required. This includes the following limited circumstances: to a congressional office 				on your behalf; to financial entities regarding financial transaction issues; to entities, including 				law enforcement, as required by law or in legal proceedings; to domestic and international customs 				relating to outgoing international mail pursuant to federal law and agreements; and to contractors and 				other entities aiding us to fulfill the service (service providers).			</p>			<p>				<strong>Information Collected from Emails and Online Forms</strong>			</p>			<p>				Many of our programs and websites allow you to send us an email. We will use the information you 				provide to respond to your inquiry, provide information, or to fill your order for postal products 				and services in which you have expressed an interest.			</p>			<p>				Remember that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. If your email communication 				is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or social security 				number, you should send it by mail unless the Web site indicates the particular site is secured.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Information Collected and Stored Automatically </strong>			</p>			<p>				We automatically collect certain information about your visit to www.click2mail.com. We limit the data collected to meet specific business needs and to fully protect your privacy. We thus may know what path(s) you took on www.click2mail.com, but we don't know who you are. We do not use this information to identify you personally without your express consent.			</p>			<p>				We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:				</p><ul>					<li>General log information--Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" or "yourschool.edu"); Internet Protocol (IP) address; operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; the date and time you access our site; and the pages that you visited. We use the information to help us make www.click2mail.com more useful to visitors. We use it to learn about how locations on our site are being used, what information is of most and least interest, and to ensure www.click2mail.com can interface with the types of technology our visitors use. We also use the information to tell us of any possible site performance problems.</li>					<li>Referral and statistical information where we have links or ad banners to or from www.click2mail.com. Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred. It may also include specific data, such as whether you are a repeat visitor; whether you visited a page with a banner on it or clicked on an ad banner and then used our site (for instance, to register or make a purchase); the value, date and time of any sale; and the identity of the site which you linked to or from www.click2mail.com. We collect this information to know which links and banners are effective. For example, this allows us to determine which ads may be of most interest and to help us control how many times a specific ad is displayed.</li>				</ul>			<p></p>			<p>				This explains <em><strong>what</strong></em> information is collected automatically. For information about <em><strong>how</strong></em> the data are collected, click below on our policy on cookies and other Web analysis tools.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Choice</strong>			</p>			<p>				Click2Mail believes in permission-based marketing. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to outside marketers. You will only receive marketing about products and services of Click2Mail or its partners, other than products and services you already receive or are registered for, under the following conditions.				</p><ul>					<li>If you are a consumer, we use an opt-in standard. If you have provided personal information to register for or purchase a product or service, we will not use that information to contact you in the future about another product or service unless you have provided express consent.</li>					<li>If you are a business, we use an opt-out standard. We assume you are interested in other products and services that could aid you in your business, and so we will provide information to you unless you tell us you do not want to receive it.</li>				</ul>			<p></p>			<p>				Consumers may opt-in, and businesses may opt-out, when they register on www.click2mail.com and create a customer profile. These preferences in the profile can be changed at any time. Please contact the privacy office at the addresses below with any questions about your preferences.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Security</strong>			</p>			<p>				In those instances where we secure your personal information in transit to us and upon receipt, Click2Mail uses the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL). The URL in your browser will change to "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place.			</p>			<p>				For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, Click2Mail employs software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Unauthorized modification or misuse of information stored in this system will be investigated and may result in criminal prosecution.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Service Providers</strong>			</p>			<p>				Click2Mail enters into relationships with service providers in order to provide the highest quality product or service. Service providers may include an entity that provides assistance for the program, such as a call center; a provider of advertising services; or a partner for the program. Click2Mail holds service providers to the same rigorous standards of privacy that apply to Click2Mail, including being made subject to the Privacy Act and Click2Mail privacy policies. Service providers that have access to personal information are also subject to security review.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Access</strong>			</p>			<p>				If you have provided personal information to us, you may request to review the information that we have maintained. Please contact the program office that provided you the product or service, the office that handled your inquiry, or the privacy office at the addresses below. We will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request.			</p>			<p>				<strong>Inquiries</strong>			</p>			<p>				We would like to hear from you if you have any questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or use of your information.			</p>			<p>				Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@click2mail.com">privacy@click2mail.com</a>, or mail us at:				</p><blockquote>					Click2Mail<br>					PO Box 25033<br>					Arlington, VA 22202-8933<br>				</blockquote>			<p></p>			<p>				We will investigate and respond to your inquiry. Your inquiry will be treated confidentially and will be protected under the Privacy Act.			</p>		</td>	</tr></tbody></table><br><br>
