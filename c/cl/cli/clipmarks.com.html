        <p> This Privacy Policy was last modified on
            September 16, 2011, and was first published and made effective on
            September 16, 2011.</p>
        
        <p>Clipboard, Inc. (“Clipboard,” “we,”
            or “us”) knows that you care how information about
            you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what
            information of yours will be collected by Clipboard when you use
            the Clipboard Service, how the information will be used, and how
            you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of
            information. We will not use or share your information with
            anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy
            Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means
            (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms
            that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning
            given them in our Terms of Use [link].</p>

<h2><a name="information-we-collect"></a>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
      <p> You
        provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail
        address, if you register for a User account with the Service
        (including by “following,” “liking,” adding
        the Clipboard application, linking your account to the Clipboard
        service, etc., on a third party website or network). If you
        correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email
        messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain
        any messages you send through the Service. You may provide us
        information in User Content you post to the Service.</p>

        <h3>Persistent Information</h3>
      <p> When you visit the Service, we may
            send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string
            of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely
            identifies your browser and lets Clipboard help you log in
            faster and enhance your navigation through the site. We may also
            store similar information in your browser's local storage so
            that information need not be unnecessarily transmitted. A cookie
            may convey information about how you browse the Service to us. A
            cookie does not collect personal information about you. A
            persistent cookie and data on your browser's local storage
            remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
            Persistent cookies and browser local storage may be used by your
            browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies and
            browser local storage can be removed by following your web
            browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and
            disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web
            browser to refuse all cookies, disable browser local storage, or
            to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features
            of the Service may not function properly if the ability to
            accept cookies and to persist local storage are disabled. </p>

        <h3>Device Identifiers</h3>
      <p> When you access the Service by or
            through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or
            remotely store one or more “device identifiers.”
            Device identifiers are small data files or similar data
            structures stored on or associated with your mobile device,
            which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used by
            Clipboard to enhance your use of the Service. A device
            identifier may be data stored in connection with the device
            hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating
            system or other software, or data sent to the device by
            Clipboard. A device identifier may convey information about how
            you browse the Service to us. A device identifier does not
            collect or share any personally identifiable information about
            you, however, a device identifier may be used in conjunction
            with other information in a manner that may constitute
            personally identifiable information. A device identifier may
            remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster
            and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features
            of the Service may not function properly if use or availability
            of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Clipboard may
            access, collect and/or store device identifiers once you enable
            Clipboard’s Services on your mobile device.</p>

        <h3>Location Data</h3>
      <p> When you utilize the Service by or through
            a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely
            store “location data,” which may include GPS
            coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar
            information regarding the location of your mobile device.
            Location data may convey information about how you browse the
            Service to us. Location data does not collect or share any
            personally identifiable information about you. Location data may
            be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that
            may constitute personally identifiable information. Some
            features of the Service, particularly location-based services,
            may not function properly if use or availability of location
            data is impaired or disabled.</p>

        <h3>Log File Information</h3>
      <p> Log file information is
            automatically reported by your browser each time you access a
            web page. When you use the Service, our servers automatically
            record certain log file information. These server logs may
            include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
            (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages
            and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on
            the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
            other such information.</p>

        <h3>Clear Gifs Information</h3>
      <p> When you use the Service, we may
            employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to
            track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In
            addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent
            to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The
            information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve
            the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Clipboard better
            for our users.</p>

        <h3>Third Party Services</h3>
      <p> Clipboard uses third party analytics
            services, including Google Analytics and Mixpanel to help
            understand use of the Service. These services collect the
            information sent by your browser as part of a web page request,
            including cookies and your IP address. Their use of such
            information is governed by their Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2><a name="how-we-use-your-information"></a>How
        We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use the personal information you submit
        to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and
        functionality of the Service.</p>

        <p>By providing Clipboard your email address (including by “following,” “liking,”
            adding the Clipboard application, linking your account to the
            Clipboard service, etc., on a third party website or network),
            you consent to our using the email address to send you
            Service-related notices, including any notices required by law,
            in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we
            may send you notifications of activity on the Service to the
            email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable
            privacy settings. We may use your email address to send you
            other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the
            Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such
            email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in
            your Settings page. Opting out may prevent you from
            receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or
            offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>

        <p>Following termination or deactivation of your User account,
            Clipboard may retain your profile information and User Content
            for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or
            audit purposes. Furthermore, Clipboard may retain and continue
            to use indefinitely all information (including User Content)
            contained in your communications to other Users or posted to
            public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or
            deactivation of your User account.</p>

        <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to
            the Service, we will ask you for your e-mail or social media
            account credentials. Clipboard will use this information to: (i)
            access your e-mail account’s address book or your social media
            account’s friends list, (ii) allow you to select third parties
            you would like to invite to the Service, (ii) register those
            third parties if your invitation is accepted, and (iv) track the
            success of our invitation service. Third parties you invite may
            contact us to request that we remove their information from our
            database at <a href="mailto:privacy@clipboard.com">privacy@clipboard.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Clipboard may use certain information about you and/or your User
            Content internally for purposes such as analyzing how the
            Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems,
            maintaining security, and personalizing content.</p>

        <p>Clipboard reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor
            the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve the right
            to remove any such information or material for any reason or no
            reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such
            information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable
            law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our
            rights or property or those of any third party. Clipboard also
            reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any
            third party.</p>

        <p>We use cookies, clear gifs, device identifiers, location data,
            and log file information to: (a) remember information so that
            you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next
            time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized
            content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our
            Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
            visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix
            technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are
            associated with certain IP addresses; (f) help you efficiently
            access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User
            Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service
            provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i)
            automatically update the Clipboard application on your system
            and related devices.</p>

<h2><a name="how-we-share-your-information"></a>How
        We Share Your Information</h2>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p>
        Clipboard will not rent or sell your personally identifiable
        information to others. Clipboard may share your personally
        identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of
        providing the Service to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use
        of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may
        store personal information in locations outside the direct control
        of Clipboard (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with
        hosting providers).</p>

        <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business
            offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally
            one of the transferred business assets in these types of
            transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in
            the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or
            dissolution.</p>

        <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose
            for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes
            available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy
            settings. Clips you post to the Service are automatically marked
            as private by default; however, if you choose to share your clip
            on the Service or on any third party website, such clips and any
            comments or information related thereto may be made available to
            the public. If you remove information that you posted to the
            Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages
            of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that
            information.</p>

        <p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other
            events or activities (“Events”) on the Service
            together with a third party partner. If you provide information
            to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for
            the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We
            cannot control third parties’ use of your information. If you do
            not want your information to be collected by or shared with a
            third party, you can choose not to participate in these
            Events.</p>

        <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Clipboard
            will not disclose personal information to any third party unless
            required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such
            action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal
            process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent,
            or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities;
            (b) to enforce our Terms of Use [link], take precautions against
            liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any
            third-party claims or allegations, to assist government
            enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of
            our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property,
            or personal safety of Clipboard, our Users or others.</p>

        <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p> We may share
            non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage
            data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of
            clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them
            understand the usage patterns for certain Clipboard services.
        </p>

        <p>Clipboard may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to
            serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad
            servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your
            browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Clipboard.
            They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.
            They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
            JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of
            their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.
            Clipboard does not provide any personally identifiable
            information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks
            without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser
            asks Clipboard to show an advertisement to a certain audience
            and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad
            server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience
            they are trying to reach. The Clipboard Privacy Policy does not
            apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party
            advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of
            such advertisers for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="how-we-protect-your-information"></a>How We Protect Your
        Information</h2>
<p>Clipboard cares about the integrity and
        security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or
        warrant the security of any information you transmit to Clipboard or
        guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed,
        disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
        technical, or managerial safeguards. Your privacy settings may also
        be affected by changes to the functionality of Clipboard’s
        distributors, such as social networks. Clipboard is not responsible
        for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</p>

        <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps
            (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity
            before granting you access to your account. You are responsible
            for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account
            information, and for controlling access to your email
            communications from Clipboard, at all times.</p> 

        <h3><a name="compromise-of-personal-information"></a>Compromise of
            Personal Information</h3>

        <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result
            of a breach of security, Clipboard will promptly notify those
            persons whose personal information has been compromised, in
            accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this
            Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
        <h3><a name="your-choices-about-your-information"></a>Your Choices
            About Your Information</h3>

        <p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable
            information through the Service, in which case Clipboard may not
            be able to provide certain services to you. You can review and
            correct the information about you that Clipboard keeps on file
            by contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:support@clipboard.com">support@clipboard.com</a>.</p> <h3><a name="childrens-privacy"></a>Children's
            Privacy</h3>

        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
            For that reason, Clipboard does not knowingly collect or solicit
            personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or
            knowingly allow such persons to register as Users. If you are
            under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to
            us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email
            address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal
            information to or on Clipboard. In the event that we learn that
            we have collected personal information from a child under age 13
            without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
            information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might
            have any information from or about a child under 13, please
            contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@clipboard.com">privacy@clipboard.com</a>.</p> <h3><a name="links-to-other-websites"></a>Links to Other Websites
        </h3>

        <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites
            linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content
            contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to
            go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no
            longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other
            website, including those that have a link on our website, is
            subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read
            over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p> <h3><a name="notification-procedures"></a>Notification Procedures
        </h3>

        <p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such
            notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other
            business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or
            hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice
            on the Service, as determined by Clipboard in its sole
            discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means
            of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out
            of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy
            Policy.</p> <h3><a name="changes-to-our-privacy-policy"></a>Changes
            to Our Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>Clipboard may update its Privacy Policy from time to time, and so
            you should review this Policy periodically. When we change the
            policy in a material way, we will update the ‘last modified’
            date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Changes to this Privacy
            Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
