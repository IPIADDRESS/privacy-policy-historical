    <td class="style1"><p>We respect    and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Website. ClickView    understands and appreciates that you, as a ClickView Online visitor, are    concerned about the confidentiality and security of information ClickView may    collect about you. When we collect information from you, we want you to know    how it is used.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What information does this Website gather? </strong><br>
      We collect personal information such as name, address, email address and    billing information when you knowingly provide it to us. Our Web servers may    automatically collect statistical information about your visit such as pages    visited and which browsers are used to visit our site. None of this    information is associated with you as an individual (see information about    cookies). If collected, we would use these statistics to monitor our site's    performance and to make it user-friendlier. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>What happens when I provide personal information on this Website? </strong><br>
      When you supply information for a specific purpose such as ordering a product    or service from ClickView, we use the information only for the purpose of    providing that product or service and ongoing support. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>What happens when I provide information to subscribe to ClickView? </strong><br>
      When you purchase a subscription, we request accurate contact information for    your school and staff. This is used to provide ongoing product support and to    send you company and product information, special offers and/or newsletters. <br>
      <br>
      If you're a ClickView customer, we store your name, purchase and usage    history and billing information to allow us to continue to provide support    and training. <br>
      <br>
      In order to improve your experience with us, we may decide to improve our    site's ability to obtain information about users. If we do, we will update    this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of    developments in this area. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Do you sell or give my information to other companies? </strong><br>
      No, we do not sell individually identifiable information obtained online    about our visitors to anyone. The only exception to this rule is if we are    required by law to release information. <br>
      <br>
      If you provide individually identifiable information at an event that we    sponsor with another company, or if you subscribe or register on a    co-sponsored or co-branded Website, you may be providing the individually    identifiable information to the co-sponsor. Review the privacy statement on    the co-branded site to learn how the partner uses this information. Be    assured that we use this information in accordance with this privacy policy. <br>
      <br>
      On occasion, ClickView shares non-personally identifiable information with    other companies in order to assess the results of a promotion. This    information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information    that would personally identify you. Information could be shared with an authorised    ClickView reseller to fulfill a request for information or to follow up on an    inquiry. <br>
      <br>
      Personal information submitted to ClickView through this Site may be    transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any    of the countries in which ClickView its affiliates or authorised resellers    maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with    respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and    processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of ClickView.    Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for    their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Do you use cookies and what do you do with the information collected? </strong><br>
      No, we do not currently use cookies.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>What do you do with personally identifiable information? </strong><br>
      Personal information you voluntarily supply when obtaining information,    purchasing services or interacting with our advertising may be shared with authorised    resellers or affiliates of ClickView. Should any changes be made in the way    we use personally identifiable information, ClickView will contact you via    email notifying you of this change and give you the opportunity to choose to    opt out of such use. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Does this site send email to site visitors? </strong><br>
      At times we may utilise email to: conduct online surveys, respond to a site    visitor's email, confirm orders placed online, send information that a    visitor has requested, reset a password, or periodically distribute a    newsletter. Occasionally, we may use opt-in email lists from third parties to    promote our latest specials. In all of these situations you will be provided    with direction on how to opt out of future emails of this nature. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>How do you protect my personal information? </strong><br>
      We are committed to protecting the information you give us, so we implement    the appropriate safeguards to do so. Within ClickView your information is    stored in password-protected, limited-access servers. Wherever possible, ClickView    servers reside behind a firewall that maintains tight controls on any access    to the system from both our internal network and the Internet. Employees are    made aware of our privacy policy and are trained on procedures to handle    privacy-related concerns. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Who do I contact if I am concerned about privacy? </strong><br>
      Please send us an email at <a href="mailto:clickview@clickview.com.au">clickview@clickview.com.au</a></p></td>
