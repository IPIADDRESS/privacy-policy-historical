Where this is the case, we will process other data only for the same purposes as “personal data” under this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Other ways we may use your Personal Information:</p><ul><li><strong>To deliver customer service</strong> and assist you with any inquiries you may have.</li><li><strong>To analyze trends, administer or optimise Cliniko</strong>, monitor usage or traffic patterns (including to track users’ movements around Cliniko) and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</li><li><strong>To control unauthorised use or abuse of Cliniko</strong>—or otherwise detect, investigate or prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.</li></ul><h2 class="heading--l2">How information is disclosed</h2><p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Cliniko will not share, sell, or rent Personal Information with anyone without your permission or unless ordered by a court of law.</p><p>We work with third-party services in Australia and the USA (such as our web host, data backup and payment provider) that we allow access to Personal Information, and may use it on our behalf strictly for the purposes for which they are engaged. We minimise the amount of personal data that is utilised by these services, and we have ensured that these services process your data in accordance with the appropriate regulations. A list of third-party services (Subprocessors) we use can be found at <a href="https://help.cliniko.com/privacy/data-processing/cliniko-subprocessors">https://help.cliniko.com/privacy/data-processing/cliniko-subprocessors</a>.</p><p>Cliniko Customers have the option of providing API keys to third-party apps, allowing the app to access the data (including Personal Information) in their Cliniko account.
