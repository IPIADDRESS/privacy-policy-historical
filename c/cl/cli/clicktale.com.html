<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the “Data Controller”, who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “Data Processor”, who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</p>
<p>Clicktale is the “Data Controller” of its Visitors’, Customers’ and prospective Customers’ Personal Data, and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Clicktale furthermore acts as Data Controller with regard to Account Data as submitted within the creation of a Customer profile or account on the Platform.</p>
<p>Any recordings of an End-User’s session on a Customer’s website or mobile application shall be processed by Clicktale on behalf of our Customer, and may be shared with such Customer in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with their reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms of Service and other commercial agreements. Such Customer shall be deemed the “Data Controller” of its End-Users’ Personal Data and Clicktale will process such data on this Customer’s behalf, as its “Data Processor”. The Customer will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to Data Controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).</p>
<p>If and End-User would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data (see Section 8) we process on our Customer’s behalf, please contact such Customer directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11. Additional Notices</h3>
<p><strong>Updates and Amendments:</strong> We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Services. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is so published. We will provide a 10-day prior notice if we believe any substantial changes are involved via any of the communication means available to us or via the Site and Platform. After such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.</p>
<p><strong>External Links:</strong> While our Site and Platform may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices, and encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Services for the website or application of such third parties and to read the privacy policies of each and every website or service you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Site, Platform and Services.</p>
