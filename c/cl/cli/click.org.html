      OUR ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY<br>
<br>
Click.org has established this Privacy Policy to explain how it protects and 
manages the personal information that it collects from you (the customer) 
online. <br>
<br>
1.Consent for Collection, Use and Disclosure<br>
<br>
Your use of the Click.org site and/or your registration for Click.org products 
and services constitute your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you 
do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the 
Click.org site. <br>
<br>
Click.org may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When it does, Click.org 
will also revise the "last update" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In 
addition, Click.org will seek a customer’s prior consent, by email, for any new 
uses or proposed disclosures of information collected from the customer prior to 
the change. Click.org will notify customers by email of changes to this policy 
that will affect information collected from them in the future. In certain 
circumstances, however, Click.org will not inform and obtain the consent of the 
customer, such as in connection with an investigation of a breach of an 
agreement, contravention of laws, an emergency where the life, health or 
security of an individual is threatened, the collection of a debt or in 
compliance with the request of a law enforcement agency or a court order.<br>
<br>
A customer may withdraw his or her consent for collection, use and disclosure at 
any time by contacting us 
       <a target="_blank" href="http://click.org/contact-us"><u>here</u></a>. Please note that if you do, 
Click.org may suspend its provision of products and services to you. <br>
<br>
2. Accountability<br>
<br>
Click.org collects, at the time of your registration and your sign-on to its web 
site, certain "personal information" (information that personally identifies 
you) including but not limited to your name, email address, home or work 
address, telephone number etc. and information about your computer hardware and 
software (e.g., IP address, operating system, browser type, domain name, URL, 
access times, and referring web site addresses). <br>
<br>
Click.org has implemented this Privacy Policy to protect personal information 
received from its customers, and to respond to any inquiries. The Privacy Policy 
also provides that Click.org will use appropriate contractual means to establish 
a comparable level of protection for personal information which is sent for 
processing by third parties on Click.org behalf. <br>
<br>
3. Purposes for Collecting Personal Information<br>
<br>
Click.org collects and uses personal information for the following purposes:<br>
<br>
(a) to understand customer needs regarding Click.org services;<br>
<br>
(b) to develop and provide our web site and our products and services for our 
customers;<br>
<br>
(c) to fulfill your requests for products, services or information; <br>
<br>
(d) to communicate with customers and site visitors, when necessary, and to 
inform customers of upgrades, as well as of other products and services 
available from Click.org, its affiliates and third parties;<br>
<br>
(e) to allow customers to access limited-entry areas of Click.org site;<br>
<br>
(f) to personalize some of our services and products for you and to deliver 
targeted advertisements and offers from Click.org and third parties;<br>
<br>
(g) to bill accounts and maintain payment records; <br>
<br>
(h) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government 
request;<br>
<br>
(i) to respond to a legitimate claim, or to address our reasonable belief, that 
you are violating the rights of any third party or any of the agreements or 
policies that govern your use of the Click.org site or any Click.org product or 
service;<br>
<br>
(j) to protect the services, products or rights of Click.org, including but not 
limited to the security or integrity of the Click.org site; and<br>
<br>
(k) to identify and resolve technical problems concerning Click.org site, 
products and services. <br>
<br>
Click.org also uses personal information in an aggregate form (i.e., not 
individually attributable to you) for its business analysis, operational, 
marketing and other promotional purposes. If we hire other companies to provide 
some products or services on our behalf, then we will only provide those 
companies the personal information they need for the Identified Purposes, and we 
will limit their rights to use and further disclose your personal information as 
appropriate in the course of their work for us.<br>
<br>
4. Limiting the Collection of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Click.org limits its collection of personal information to only that information 
which is necessary for the Identified Purposes. Click.org does not direct its 
site to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from children 
under the age of thirteen.<br>
<br>
When you visit the Click.org web site, a cookie may be placed on your computer 
or the cookie may be read if you have visited the Click.org site previously. 
Click.org uses cookies to allow Click.org to determine which products and 
services you have already purchased so that Click.org does not provide redundant 
information to you, and, if you are an Click.org affiliate, to track Click.org 
sales made to customers referred by you so that you can receive compensation 
under our affiliate program. If you choose to not have your browser accept 
cookies from the Click.org web site, you may not be able to view all the text on 
the screens, or to experience a personalized visit, or to subscribe to certain 
service and product offerings on the Click.org site.<br>
<br>
5. Disclosure, Processing and Retention <br>
<br>
From time to time, Click.org may disclose certain personally identifiable 
information with affiliated business partners or authorized third parties on a 
need to know basis for evaluating authorized customers for service eligibility. 
With exception to the above, Click.org does not sell, rent or disclose your 
personal information to anyone else, except:<br>
<br>
(a) to someone you have designated to act as your agent, for one or more of the 
Identified Purposes (listed in Section 2, above);<br>
<br>
(b) to Click.org employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, 
consultants, business associates, service providers, suppliers and agents, 
acting on Click.org behalf for any of the Identified Purposes;<br>
<br>
(c) as necessary if Click.org has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary 
to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing 
injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with 
Click.org rights or property, other users of Click.org web site, products or 
services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; and<br>
<br>
(d) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement 
agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public 
safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law. <br>
<br>
In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we may 
sell or buy other businesses or entities, or we may merge with another company. 
In such transactions, personal information may be one of the transferred 
business assets. Also, in the event that Click.org or substantially all of its 
assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred 
assets.<br>
<br>
Your information may be stored and processed in the United States, or in any 
other country in which Click.org or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents 
maintain facilities. By using this web site, you consent to any such transfer of 
information outside of your country. <br>
<br>
After your account becomes inactive (that is, if you request to be removed from 
our database), Click.org will keep your personal information in its archives. 
Your information will then be used only as necessary for tax reasons or to prove 
Click.org compliance with any applicable law. <br>
<br>
6. Accuracy of Personal Information<br>
<br>
Click.org will use reasonable efforts to keep customer personal information 
accurate for the Identified Purposes, and for minimizing the possibility of 
making inappropriate customer decisions based on such information. Customers are 
responsible for informing Click.org about changes to their personal information. 
You can do this by <a target="_blank" href="http://click.org/contact-us">contacting us</a>. Click.org will use 
new or updated personal information it receives from customers to update its own 
records. <br>
<br>
7. Security Safeguards<br>
<br>
Click.org will use reasonable efforts to protect customers’ personal 
information.<br>
<br>
8. Access to Personal Information<br>
<br>
Click.org will afford you a reasonable opportunity to review the personal 
information in your file, if you so request by faxing 480-393-5100.<br>
<br>
If Click.org is not able to provide access to some aspect of a customer’s 
personal information, it will provide reasons for denying access such as; that 
by doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party, or 
that it is confidential commercial information or attorney–client privileged 
communications, or that the information relates to a breach of an agreement or a 
contravention of law, or that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to 
threaten the life or security of another individual.<br>
<br>
Customers have the right to request that inaccurate or incomplete information be 
amended as appropriate, by contacting Click.org or as described above. Click.org 
will promptly correct such personal information.</div>
