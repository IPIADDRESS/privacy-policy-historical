            <p>The purpose of the data processing and the corresponding legal principles are given below.</p>
            <p>Where data processing takes place between you and any event organisers (e.g. through the

                circumstances of the data processing and any consent given or other legal principles
                conform in all cases with the data protection regulations of the promoter.</p>

                for information purposes, and therefore do not register, log in or otherwise communicate

                Cookies are text files which are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser on
                your computer system when calling up a website. A cookie contains a characteristic string
                which enables a clear identification of the browser when the website is called up once more.
                We employ these cookies in order to provide our website to you together with its technical
                functions. A number of functions of our website cannot be provided without the use of
                cookies and therefore these cookies are absolutely necessary in order for us to be able to
                operate our website. The following information is stored in the cookies and communicated to

            <p>We process your personal data for the technical provision of our website on the basis of the
                following legal principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>for the performance of a contract or in order to take steps prior to entering into a
                    contract in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. b of the GDPR where you visit our
                    website in order to obtain information about our range of services, in particular
                    about one of our fee-based subscriptions and our events; and

            <h4>Statistical analysis of the use of the website and expansion of reach</h4>

            <p>We employ cookies with your consent for the analysis of the use of our website and/or for the expansion of our reach.</p>
            <p><strong>On the first visit to our website an overlay appears in which you may select which
                    cookies we may place on your device for what purposes and what information is
                    gathered for this. You have the option to permit all cookies or to individually choose
                    between the cookies. The consent applies for a period of 90 days. After expiry of this

                    choice. If you wish to previously revoke your consent, you may do this by deleting the
                    cookies placed by us. This is fundamentally permitted by every current browser. The
                    details of how you do this may be obtained from the operating instructions of your
                    specific browser. Should you delete the cookies, the overlay will re-appear on your
                    next visit to our website and you can make the appropriate choice once more.</strong></p>
            <p>Consent may only be granted by users who are over 16 years of age. If you are younger, we

            <h5>(a) Cookies for the improvement of our website</h5>

            <p>For statistical analysis purposes of the use of our website we employ analysis tools such as
                Google Analytics, and thus cookies, which enable an analysis of your surfing habits. This
                works similarly to the viewing figures for television. We are able as a result to improve the
                quality of our website and our content. We discover how the website is being used and can
                thus constantly optimise our range of services.</p>
            <p>The information obtained as part of the statistical analysis of our website is not combined
                with the rest of your data collected during your visit to our website.</p>

            <h6>Google Analytics</h6>
            <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”).
                Google Analytics uses what are known as "cookies” which are text files stored on your
                computer which allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by
                the cookie on your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA
                and stored there. Where IP-anonymization is activated on this website, your IP address will,
                however, be previously shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or
                in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in
                exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and
                abbreviated there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of
                clipmyhorse.tv in order to assess your use of the website, to compile reports on the website
                activities and to provide additional services associated with the website usage and internet
                usage for the website operator. The IP address communicated by your browser as part of
                Google Analytics will not be combined with other Google data.</p>
            <p>This website uses Google Analytics with the extension „_anonymizeIp()“. IP addresses are
                processed as a result in an abbreviated form, a direct personal reference can be thus
                excluded.</p>
            <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by an appropriate setting of your browser software;
                however, we would like to point out that you will possibly not be able in this case to make
                complete use of all functions on this website.</p>
            <p>You can prevent the collection of the data generated by a cookie and relating to your use of

            <h6>Google Adsense</h6>
            <p>clipmyhorse.tv uses the online advertising service, Google AdSense. Advertising is intended
                through its use to be presented to you which is designed for your interests. These
                advertisements can be recognised by the information “Google Ads” in each of the
                advertisements.</p>
            <p>Due to your visit to our website Google receives the information that you have called up our
                website. For this, Google places a cookie on your computer. The data listed under item 3.2.1
                of this data protection declaration are transmitted. Additionally, so-called web beacons are
                utilised; these are invisible graphic images with whose use your user behaviour on our
                website can be evaluated. The IP address communicated by your browser as part of Google
                AdSense will not be combined with other Google data. We neither have any influence on the
                data collected nor is the full extent of the data collection known to us. These data are
                transmitted to the USA and analysed there. It is possible that these data are passed on to
                contractual partners of Google and to authorities. This website has also activated Google
                AdSense advertisements of third-party providers. The above-mentioned data may be
                transmitted to these third-party providers (the list may be found under
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors?visit_id=0-636589427183379249-3187330481&amp;rd=1" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/third-party-ads/adx-vendors?visit_id=0-636589427183379249-3187330481&amp;rd=1</a>).
            </p>
            <p>You can prevent the installation of the Google AdSense cookies in various ways<br>
                a) through an appropriate setting in your browser software, in particular the suppression of third-party cookies leads to you receiving no advertisements from third-party providers;<br>
                b) by deactivating the Google interest-related advertisements via the link <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>, whereby this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies;<br>
                c) by deactivating the providers’ interest-related advertisement which are part of the
                self-regulating campaign “About Ads“, via the link <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, whereby
                this setting is deleted if you delete your cookies;<br>
                d) through a permanent deactivation in your
                browsers, Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, under the link

            <h6>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h6>
            <p>We use the online advertising program “Google AdWords” and, as part of Google AdWords,
                Conversion Tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service of Google Inc.
                (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”). If you click on an
                advertisement placed by Google, a cookie for Conversion Tracking will be placed onto your
                computer. These cookies are valid for 30 days, contain no personal data and are thus not
                used for personal identification.</p>
            <p>If you visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we
                can detect that you have clicked on the advertisement and have been forwarded to this
                page. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. There is thus no
                possibility that cookies can be tracked back via the websites of AdWords customers.</p>
            <p>The information which is obtained with the aid of the conversion cookie is used to generate
                conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have decided on Conversion Tracking.
                From this, customers discover the total number of users who have clicked on their
                advertisement and who have been forwarded to a page which is marked with a Conversion
                Tracking tag. However, they receive no information with which users can be personally
                identified.</p>
            <p>We use Google AdWords solely with your consent. You can revoke a consent which you
                have granted by</p>
            <ul>
                <li>proceeding as described above;</li>
                <li>Download and install the browser plug-in to be found under the following link:

                    browsers used by you on all your end devices and must also reactivate it where
                    necessary if you delete all cookies in a browser. More detailed information and

            <h6>Google Tag Manager and Google Publisher Tags</h6>
            <p>We use the Google Tag Manager from Google on our website. The Google Tag Manager is
                a solution with which the marketer can manage website tags via a user interface. The
                Google Tag Manager service itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain and
                does not collect any personal data. The Google Tag Manager service ensures the triggering
                of other tags which in turn may collect data under certain circumstances. Google Tag
                Manager does not access these data. If a deactivation has been undertaken at domain or
                cookie level, it remains in existence for all tracking tags which are implemented using Google
                Tag Manager, more detail on this may be found under:
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.
            </p>

            <h6>Facebook Pixel and links to social media pages</h6>
            <p>The behaviour of users can be backtracked using Facebook Pixel after they have been
                forwarded to the website of a provider by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. This
                behaviour is used to assess the effectiveness of Facebook advertising for statistical and
                market research purposes and may contribute to the optimisation of future advertising
                measures. The collected data are anonymous for us and therefore provide us with no
                indication of the personal identities of the users. However, the data of Facebook are stored
                and processed so that a connection to the relevant user profile is possible and Facebook is
                able to use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Facebook data
                usage guidelines (
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>).
                They can enable Facebook and its partners to place advertisements within and outside Facebook. Additionally,
                a cookie may be stored on your computer for these purposes.
            </p>
            <p>A consent for the use of the visitor behaviour pixel may only be declared by users who are
                over 16 years of age. If you are younger, we would request you to ask your parent/guardian
                for permission. Please only click here if you wish to revoke your consent: <a id="fbq-opt-out" href="javascript: openConsent();">LINK</a>

            </p>
            <p>We use no social plug-ins on our website but instead simply place a link to the social media
                website in question (e.g. www.facebook.com) and our presence there. The data processing
                on these social media websites is beyond our knowledge and our control and may be
