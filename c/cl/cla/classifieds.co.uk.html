		<p><strong>a) Traffic or Clickstream Data ("Clickstream Data").</strong></p>
		<p>
			Clickstream Data consists of traffic and usage data that is not personally identifiable. We do
			not supplement or combine Clickstream Data with any PII. We may share Clickstream Data we collect
			with certain selected third parties and ValueClick Entities, but only in anonymous form.
			Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third parties and ValueClick Entities may combine such
			Clickstream Data with any PII that you choose to give to such third parties or ValueClick
			Entities when registering with their websites. We collect Clickstream Data regarding use of
			our services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) you access. For example, our
			servers collect information about the site to which you may redirect to in order to enable us
			to calculate and receive payments from our business partners. In addition, we may use Clickstream
			Data to better design our services. Within the company and with respect to online behavioural
			advertising, certain affiliated companies may use non-personally identifiable information
			(which may or may not include click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject
			of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other
			websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater
			interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect
			this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice and/or to opt-out
			of this type of advertising, you can visit

		<p><strong>(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
		
		<p>
			For each visitor to our website, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's
			IP address. We use your IP address to administer our website. Upon visiting our website, we
			assign each visitor a unique ID that is used to track visitor traffic patterns within our
			website. We also collect aggregate and user-specific information on the pages that visitors
			access or visit. We reserve the right to retain all website traffic reporting data as long
			as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and auditing purposes. As part of our on-going
			efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all users of the Site, we may use log files,
			web beacons and cookies to collect Non-PII from the Site, browsers, advertisers and third-party
			sites. "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site and collect data including: your IP
			address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type,
			date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed. Image requests or ("web beacons")
			can transmit information used to track your data, which may include the navigation of a website
			or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing
			behaviour. This information is written to cookies."Cookies" are files that are stored on your
			Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are
			used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that
			when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination.
			We may use Cookies for purposes which may include, without limitation, to estimate the total reach
			of any of our advertisers, how frequently you return to the Site, as well as to streamline
			experiences of users of our Site. Cookies are also an anonymous way to survey how we are
			doing and to look for ways to improve our services. All information collected by Cookies,
			Web beacons and Log files are Non-PII.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) "Session
			Cookies" may be used only during your visit to the Site and are erased once you close your
			browser, and (ii) "Persistent Cookies" (if applicable) remain on your browser for one (1) year
			from your last visit to the Site and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Site
			and provide more relevant content to you on such Site.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy.
			Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an
			e-mail address or any other PII. We do not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII
			from your computer.

		<p>
			We also use this information for internal business purposes, such as aggregating the data to
			help us to create a profile of Classifieds.co.uk visitors, as a
			whole, so that we can: a) build a better understanding of our users and enhance the services
			we offer, and b) attract advertisers to spend money on
			Classifieds.co.uk, thus enabling our free price comparison
