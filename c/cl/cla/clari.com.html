The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the sole purpose of providing the service for which your organization (Clari’s Client) has engaged Clari.

<h3>What Information Does Clari Collect?</h3>
<h4>Information You Provide</h4>
<p>When you visit the Site and express an interest in obtaining additional information about Clari or the Service, or register to receive marketing materials, event registrations or any other form submission tools that collect your personal contact information such as name, company name, address, phone number and email address (“Required Contact Information”), Clari collects this personal information.</p>
<p>By downloading and enabling the Service, you are authorizing Clari to access and store all of the foregoing types of Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information you submit as part of the registration process such as your name and email address</li>
<li>Information you elect to submit (including, without limitation, any text, documents, images or other content or materials) to any areas of the Service that are accessible by other Service users within your organization ("User Submissions"). Such information may be shared with other Services users within your organization - as elected by you via the Service. For example, if you post a photo as part of a deal note, that may be visible to other Service users within your organization. We endeavor to make sure the Service's functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of an intended submission.</li>
<li>Information that Clari may obtain from third-party services (both Personal and Enterprise Information, such as CRM data, files, email/calendar information, and contacts) that Clari requires for the operation of the Clari service.</li>
</ul>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that you will not (i) provide us with any information that you do not have the right to provide, or (ii) share, via the Service, any information you do not have the right to share (such as information that is confidential to any third party and that you are not authorized to share with your intended recipients).</p>
<h4>Information You Authorize Us to Collect</h4>
<p>Certain features of the Service may allow you to import information from third party services (such as Salesforce) ("Third Party Services"). By requesting that Clari import such information, you authorize Clari to use your Third Party Service username and password to access the applicable Third Party Service Account. This authentication process is managed by the applicable Third Party Service provider. Clari will not use your Third Party Service account credentials for any other purpose.</p>
<h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
<p>Whenever you interact with our Service, we may automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, "cookie" information, web beacons, the type of browser and/or device you're using to access our Service, domain name server and the page or feature you requested (“tracking information”). In addition, when using the Site, Clari and its partners may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Service are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. When we collect the usage information described in this paragraph, we only use this data in aggregate form. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Service, and we can use that knowledge to make the Service valuable to as many users as possible.</p>

<p>The Company’s Web sites may use social media features, such as the Facebook ‘like’ button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Company’s Web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.</p>
<h4>Do Not Track</h4>
<p>Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Salesforce does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
<h4>Mobile Application Usage</h4>
<p>When you download our mobile applications and use them to access our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and operating system version. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>

Opting-out can be done by clicking the "manage email settings" link at the bottom of every email.</li>
<li>To help personalize the Service experience for you (such as, remembering your information so you will not have to enter it each time you use the Service).</li>

<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Clari, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Clari goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Clari may continue to use your Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>What About Third-Party Services Clari Connects To?</h3>
<p>Clari links to other services, such as Salesforce. Clari does not access any information from these third-party services without your authorization, or by the authorization of your organization. You grant Clari this authorization when you connect these services to Clari, or when your organization's IT team authorizes these connections on your behalf. To opt out of connecting to these services, contact your organization.</p>
<h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>Clari takes robust information security measures to protect your Information and to limit the risk that it will be accessed without authorization, including use of certain industry standard technologies and practices. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. That said, we cannot guarantee the security of such Information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. No security system is perfect - so your use of the Service is at your own risk.</p>
<p>If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you via email, phone, physical mail, or by a posting on your Service account page - so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Pursuant to our Terms of Service you have consented to receive such notice by electronic means (provided that such consent is void where prohibited by applicable law). To receive a free written notice of a security breach, or if you have any questions about the security of the Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@clari.com">info@clari.com</a></p>
<p>In addition to the security measures referenced above, your Service account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last changed on the date set forth at the top of the policy. We're constantly trying to improve the Service, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the <a href="http://www.clari.com/privacy">www.clari.com/privacy</a>,&nbsp;by sending you an email, providing a notification through your Service account, and/or by some other means. In addition, we will also edit the date at the top of this policy to reflect the date of the changes. Please note that if you've opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Service, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
