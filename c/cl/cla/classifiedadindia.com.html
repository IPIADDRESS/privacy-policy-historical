      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <span style="text-align:justify"> We understand that you have confidential information and want you to know that classifiedadindia.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online, and that we strive to make our site as safe and secure as reasonably possible. If you have any questions after reading the statement, please let us know. We want to hear from you! You can email us by using our contact us form.<br>
      <br>
      <h4>Information Collection</h4>
      During registration we ask for your name, country, state, zip/postal code, email address. In addition to the information we obtain at registration, we may ask you for information at other times, such as when you make a purchase or register for a service on classifiedadindia.com, when you submit a listing for a Web site, or when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact classifiedadindia.com we may keep a record of that correspondence. classifiedadindia.com also may occasionally ask you to provide information to participate in certain voluntary promotions, surveys, or contests (see the section regarding this below). Finally, classifiedadindia.com collects information about its Members in general, which does not necessarily identify the Member, using our server log files and some of the methods described under "cookies" below. <br>
      <h4>Partner Services or Linked sites</h4>
      Certain products and services available through classifiedadindia.com are made available by other companies with which classifiedadindia.com has a strategic alliance. To obtain some of these other products and services you may be on the other company's Web site or a site they share with classifiedadindia.com. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with classifiedadindia.com. In these cases, this privacy policy does not apply; instead, the privacy policy of the partner actually providing the goods or services will apply. We urge you to read and understand our partners' policies before entering into agreements with them. We are committed to partnering with companies that share our privacy concerns. classifiedadindia.com, however, can't control the way these partners collect or use information. <br>
      <br>
      Also, when you click through to a partner's, an advertiser's, or other site linked from classifiedadindia.com, those companies may use cookies or other means to collect information about you. Again, this privacy policy does not apply to those sites; instead, the privacy policy of the site you visit will apply. <br>
      <br>
      If you have questions about our partners' privacy policies or the privacy policies of these other sites, we encourage you to contact them directly. <br>

This may be necessary so that they may process your orders and ship, supply, maintain, or service the goods or services that you requested. If you register directly with another company reached through the classifiedadindia.com site, then that company will have control over the information you provide. <br>
