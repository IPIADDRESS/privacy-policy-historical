<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>  Clark University (“Clark”) is fully committed to providing  an informative, useful, and engaging website for its visitors. This privacy  policy sets out how Clark uses and protects any information that you give to  Clark when you use Clark-controlled and operated websites as well as other  information you may provide to us from time to time.</p>
  
<p>  Clark University is committed to ensuring that your privacy  is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can  be identified when using this website or through other mechanisms, it will only  be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<div align="center">
  <hr size="0" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>What We Collect</strong><br>
  Clark collects two kinds of information on its websites:  1) information you voluntarily supply when  you visit the website and register an account, fill out a form to request  information, “opt-in” for participation in a service, complete a survey, or  engage with other site features; and 2) information that is collected automatically  as you navigate the site.</p>
<p>In addition  to any personal information you actively provide to us, Clark systems automatically  record certain non-personal information such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the domain and host from which you  access the Web; </li>
  <li>The geographic location of your point of  connectivity; </li>
  <li>The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the  computer you are using; </li>
  <li>The browser used and the operating system you  are using; </li>
  <li>The date and time you access this site; </li>
  <li>Visitor-specific information such as the pages accessed/visited,  the order in which they were visited, the hyperlinks employed, and the Internet  address of the website linked directly to this site.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Clark may  also collect tracking information through the use of “cookies” -- cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer to facilitate your future access to  websites. Your visit remains anonymous until you knowingly identify yourself. The  collected information is used for internal University purposes, and to improve  the content and navigation of Clark’s overall website. </p>
<p>Clark uses Google  Analytics to help manage our website. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">Terms</a>&nbsp;pages  for more&nbsp;information on how Google uses/maintains user information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What We Do with the Information We Gather</strong> <br>
  We use this  information to understand your needs and provide you with better service. In  particular, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>To answer a question you have asked;</li>
  <li>To provide you with the information or       service you have requested (e.g., newsletter);</li>
  <li>For internal record keeping;</li>
  <li>To improve our services, including       performance and functionality of the website;</li>
  <li>To periodically send promotional       emails about University programs, events, or other information we think       you may find interesting, using the email address you have provided; and </li>
  <li>From time to time, we may also use       your information to contact you for market research purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  We are  committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent  unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place industry standard physical,  electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information  we collect online.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong><br>
  Clark’s web pages  may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you use these  links and leave the Clark website, you should note that we do not have control  over other third-party websites. Clark is not responsible for the protection  and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting third-party websites  and this privacy policy does not govern such sites. You should exercise caution  and look at the privacy statement applicable to the third-party websites in  question.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Online Forums</strong><br>
  Clark makes  forums, message boards, and other collaborative features available to its  users.  The University does not  ordinarily log public chat sessions, however, any information disclosed in  these areas becomes public information and you should therefore exercise  caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in such places. Clark  may collect such information if it has reasonable cause to suspect misuse,  unlawful conduct, breach of University policy, or other reasonable cause to  collect such information. </p>
<p><strong>Links to Online Surveys</strong><br>
  Clark  employs the use of online surveys, which may be conducted on the University’s  website. It is University policy that confidential information gathered in  these online surveys is used only for the research purposes indicated in the  survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, your answers are  confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties.  Aggregate data from surveys may be shared.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling Your Personal Information</strong><br>
  You may  choose to restrict the use of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy  Policy.<br>
  If you have  any questions or further concerns relating to how we use your personal data as  described above, or if you believe that personal data we have is incorrect or  incomplete, please contact us with “<strong><u>Privacy  Request</u></strong>” as the subject line in writing, at: </p>

<p><strong>If You Are Located in the European Union (EU)</strong><br>
  If you are  receiving services from Clark in a member state of European Union (EU), or if  you are located in a member state of the European Union (EU) when you visit  Clark websites, we will do our best to observe the EU General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws when we process  your personal information.</p>
<p>Personal  information relating to you from which you can be identified (such as your name  and contact details, as well as other personal information about you) is called  “personal data” under the GDPR.<br>
  If you are  located in the EU and we offer or provide services to you, the&nbsp;<strong><em>following additional provisions beyond the  general privacy statements set forth above apply</em></strong>&nbsp;in relation to  how we handle your personal data.</p>
<p>We may  collect personal data about you for one or more of the following purposes:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>To respond to inquiries from you,       process any application you submit relating to studying at Clark University,       on a Study Abroad program and/or you register for another service that we       offer;</li>
  <li>To set up and administer our agreement       with you, if you enroll as a student and/or wish to participate in one of       our programs and/or receive other services;</li>
  <li>To consider you for employment, if you       apply for a job/position at the University;</li>
  <li>To be able to effectively manage the       University and administer its programs and to be able to look after you as       well as other students;</li>
  <li>To comply with any existing legal       obligations or to manage legal issues or claims that may arise;</li>
  <li>To keep you informed about Clark and related       news and events, but only if we have your consent and are sending you       information about goods or services that are the same as those you have       previously shown interest in (and subject to you being able to opt-out of       further communication at any time); </li>
  <li>To provide direct marketing to you,       but in relation to electronic marketing only where we have your consent in       accordance with applicable law or are sending you information about goods       or services that are the same as those you have previously inquired about       or purchased (and subject to you being able to opt-out of further direct       marketing at any time); or</li>
  <li>To respond to any issues, request, or       questions that you raise with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also  process personal data of EU residents in the following situations:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>If you apply to work for Clark       University and are located at one of our locations in the EU, we may need       to process your personal data in connection with your job application and transfer       that personal data to Clark University servers located in the United       States; </li>
  <li>If you inquire and/or apply to study       at one of our partner schools or programs located in the EU, we may need       to process your personal data in connection with your application to that       partner school or program and transfer that personal data to Clark       University servers located in the United States. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Lawful Basis on Which We Collect Data</strong><br>
  The lawful  grounds under which we collect and use this personal data are where:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>You have freely provided your       specific, informed and unambiguous consent;</li>
  <li>We have agreed to provide services to       you, to set up and perform our contractual obligations and/or enforce our       contractual rights;</li>
  <li>We need to use your personal data for       our legitimate interests in being able to manage Clark’s operations, its       courses and its programs. We will pursue these interests in a way that       respects your legal rights or freedoms and, in particular, your privacy       rights;</li>
  <li>We need to use your personal data to       comply with a legal obligation or for the purpose of the University being       able to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; and/or</li>
  <li>We need to use personal data to       protect your vital interests or those of someone else (for example, in a       medical emergency or if there is an urgent welfare issue).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you  provide us with any ”special category” personal data about you, which under the  GDPR includes information in relation to your health, religious/political or  philosophical beliefs, racial/ethnic origin, sex life/sexual orientation, in  addition to the above, we will use this 'special category' data in the  following circumstances:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>We have your explicit consent â for       example, to send you details of University interest groups or support       resources that you may be interested in, if you are, have been or you       become a student and/or alumni;</li>
  <li>The data is needed by us to comply       with applicable employment, social security or social protection laws;</li>
  <li>To protect your vital interests or       those of someone else, as noted above;</li>
  <li>You have clearly publicized such       information; and/or</li>
  <li>We need to use such special category       data in connection with a legal claim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclosing Your Personal Data</strong><br>
  Third party  suppliers (called “processors”) may process your personal data on Clark  University’s behalf, in accordance with our contractual agreements. For  example, this may be to provide business support such as IT infrastructure,  data or website hosting, payment services, professional advice (e.g. legal  advice) and/or to protect the University (and our students or employees) from  fraud or other criminal behavior.</p>
<p>We may also  disclose your personal data to third parties external to the University who  make their own determination as to how they use your personal data and for what  purpose(s) (called “controllers”). This may include EU-based partner  universities and educational institutions in support of our Study Abroad/Away  programs. Clark’s study abroad/away programs and locations are listed on the Clark  University website at <a href="http://www.clarku.edu/undergraduate-admissions-study-abroad-and-away">http://www.clarku.edu/undergraduate-admissions-study-abroad-and-away</a>,   <a href="http://www2.clarku.edu/offices/leir/">http://www2.clarku.edu/offices/leir/</a> and <a href="https://www2.clarku.edu/school-of-professional-studies/about/campusesabroad.cfm">https://www2.clarku.edu/school-of-professional-studies/about/campusesabroad.cfm</a>.  </p>
<p>We may also  provide your personal data to third parties from time to time. We will only  provide your personal data for the specific purpose of providing additional services  to you and we provide the minimum amount of data that is required to offer such  services. However, if you then make further arrangements with those third-party  controllers with whom you deal, they may handle your data in accordance with  their own chosen procedures. You should review the relevant privacy policies of  these organizations to understand how they may use your personal data. Other  than as set out above, we will treat your personal data as private and will not  disclose it to third parties without your knowledge.&nbsp;The exceptions are in  relation to legal proceedings or where we are legally required to provide your  data to a court, regulator or similar person and are legally prevented from  telling you.</p>
<p>In all  cases, third parties are required to only use your personal data for lawful  purposes and in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring Your Data</strong><br>
  By  interacting with Clark’s website and explicitly providing Clark with your  personal data, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to Clark  University and stored on computers, servers and/or in files in the United  States. Please note US federal and state laws, are not at present, considered  to meet the same legal standards of protection for personal data as European  Union law. However, in order to safeguard your personal data, we only transfer  data from the EU to the US under a contract or another appropriate mechanism  that is approved under applicable law and that protects that data to the same  standards that you would expect in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping Your Personal Data</strong><br>
  Clark University  retains your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for  which it was processed; is necessary to perform our obligations to you (or to  enforce or defend legal claims); or, as is required by applicable law. We have  a data retention and erasure policy that sets out the different periods for  which we retain data for the relevant purpose it was collected and used. The  data retention schedule is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.clarku.edu/policies/detailpolicy.cfm?pid=73">https://web.clarku.edu/policies/detailpolicy.cfm?pid=73</a>. </p>
<p>The criteria  we use for determining data retention periods is based on various legislative  requirements; the purpose for which we hold data and whether retaining the data  is needed in connection with that purpose; and further specific guidance issued  by relevant regulatory authorities on data retention/erasure including, but not  limited to, EU regulatory authorities.  Personal  data that is no longer required by Clark is either destroyed, erased and/or  anonymized so that you can no longer be identified from it.<br>
  <br>
  Clark employs  appropriate technical and administrative security controls to protect against  access to your personal data by unauthorized persons and against unlawful  processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. Clark also endeavors to  take all reasonable steps to protect personal data from external threats such  as malicious software or hacking. However, there are always inherent risks in  sending information by public networks or using public computers and we cannot 100%  guarantee the security of all data sent to us.</p>
<p><strong>Your Personal Data Rights</strong><br>
  Under the  GDPR, those EU residents with whom we deal have various data protection rights,  which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The  right to be informed of how your personal data are being used - this right is  usually fulfilled by the provision of 'privacy notices' as described above; </li>
  <li>The  right of access to your personal data - accessing personal data in this way is  usually known as making a “subject access request” or SAR;</li>
  <li>The  right to have your inaccurate personal data rectified; </li>
  <li>The right  to have your personal data erased where appropriate - known as the right to be  forgotten; </li>
  <li>The  right to restrict the processing of your personal data pending its verification  or correction</li>
  <li>The  right to receive copies of your personal data in a machine-readable and  commonly-used format - known as the right to data portability; </li>
  <li>The  right to object to processing (including profiling) of your personal data unless  we have a compelling legitimate reason for doing so (e.g. a legal obligation); </li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
  <li>The right       to object to direct marketing and to opt-out of anything you might       have previously opted-in to;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The  right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision-making  using your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually we  will respond to a SAR request within 30 days. For a complex or numerous requests,  we may require an additional 60 days to respond. We may deny or charge for  administrative time in dealing with any manifestly unreasonable or excessive  requests. We may also require further information to locate specific  information you seek.  You should note  that certain legal exemptions may also apply to what we can disclose in  response.</p>
<p>If you would  like to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at the  address below. We may need to ask for evidence to verify your identity before  we can fully respond.</p>
<p>If you make  a request and are not satisfied with our response, or believe that we are  illegally processing your personal data, you have the right to complain to a  data protection supervisory authority in your EU country of residence.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling Your Personal Information</strong><br>
  You may  choose to restrict the use of your personal data in accordance with this  privacy policy.<br>
  If you have  any questions or further concerns relating to how we use your personal data as  described above, or you believe that personal data we have is incorrect or  incomplete, please contact us with “<strong><u>EU  Data Request</u></strong>” as the subject line:</p>
