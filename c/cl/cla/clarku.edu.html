     <h1>Privacy 
      Policy</h1>
At Clark, we understand that issues surrounding personal privacy and 
      the Internet are a major concern. We are committed to protecting the 
      rights of all our visitors and want to share with you how we gather 
      information to improve our pages. <p></p>
      <p><b>Collection of On-line Information For Web 
      Statistics</b> </p>
      <p>We want to assure you as you explore our site that we do not collect 
      any sensitive data that you would not want us to know without consent. We 
      only acquire personal information you submit through e-mail or written 
      correspondence. </p>
      <p>The information we track includes the number of visitors we receive to 
      certain pages, the country from where the user is connecting, the browser 
      being used, keywords from search engines and links from on-line 
      directories used to find us. </p>
      <p>The information we do record helps us analyze the traffic to various 
      sections of our site and aids us in site development. Our goal is to use 
      this data to continue to make the site easy to navigate with content that 
      meets the needs of our visitors.</p>
      <p><b>Regarding E-mail</b> </p>
      <p>We only publish e-mail addresses of Clark alumni and students who tell 
      us that they wish to post this information. For those who do provide us 
      with their address for publication on the Web, you may receive periodic 
      mailings from us with information about Clark or upcoming campus 
      events.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to publish e-mail addresses of Clark faculty, 
      administration, and staff at our discretion to better serve the academic 
      community, parents, and prospective students.</p><!--
<p> Our system administrators respect the privacy of the users of on-campus systems 
  under their control. They will not examine, nor allow others to examine the 
  files or e-mail of users without permission except in situations where it is 
  necessary for system administrators to ensure or restore the proper functioning 
  of the system. However, access may be necessary in situations that call for the investigation 
  of a complaint, when the Dean of Students, Provost, or Human Resources Manager 
  is notified--or when compelled to do so by law. For additional details on this 
  policy please refer to the <a href="http://www.clarku.edu/offices/vpit/policy.shtml "> 
  Policy on Appropriate Use of Clark's Information Technology System </a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#993333">Secure Transmissions</font></b> </p>
<p>Using an easy point and click interface, we've developed some sections of the 
  site where you can enter your credit card number or bank information and submit 
  it to us. </p>
<p>Clark does not collect or assemble personal information for sale. The information 
  is transmitted using the latest encryption technology with today's browsers 
  and housed by a third-party affiliate. We strongly feel that your information 
  should be kept on a server that specializes in 24-hour security and do everything 
  we can to ensure we protect our visitors. Access is only given to those qualified 
  professionals who are assigned the job of meeting your requests. </p>
