<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#3399cc" size="5">Privacy 
  Policy<br>
  </font></p>
<p>At Clark, we understand that issues surrounding personal privacy and the Internet 
  are a major concern. We are committed to protecting the rights of all our visitors 
  and want to share with you how we gather information to improve our pages. </p>
<p><b><font color="#993333">Collection of On-line Information For Web Statistics</font></b> 
</p>
<p>We want to assure you as you explore our site that we do not collect any sensitive 
  data that you would not want us to know without consent. We only acquire personal 
  information you submit through e-mail or written correspondence. </p>
<p>The information we track includes the number of visitors we receive to certain 
  pages, the country from where the user is connecting, the browser being used, 
  keywords from search engines and links from on-line directories used to find 
  us. </p>
<p>The information we do record helps us analyze the traffic to various sections 
  of our site and aids us in site development. Our goal is to use this data to 
  continue to make the site easy to navigate with content that meets the needs 
  of our visitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <b><font color="#993333">Regarding E-mail</font></b> </p>
<p>We only publish e-mail addresses of Clark alumni and students who tell us that 
  they wish to post this information. For those who do provide us with their address 
  for publication on the Web, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information 
  about Clark or upcoming campus events.</p>
<p> We reserve the right to publish e-mail addresses of Clark faculty, administration, 
  and staff at our discretion to better serve the academic community, parents, 
  and prospective students.</p>
<p> Our system administrators respect the privacy of the users of on-campus systems 
  under their control. They will not examine, nor allow others to examine the 
  files or e-mail of users without permission except in situations where it is 
  necessary for system administrators to ensure or restore the proper functioning 
  of the system. In the event that it is not possible to obtain permission, the 
  user and the Information Technology Advisory Committee will be notified promptly. 
  However, access may be necessary in situations that call for the investigation 
  of a complaint, when the Dean of Students, Provost, or Human Resources Manager 
  is notified--or when compelled to do so by law. For additional details on this 
  policy please refer to the <a href="http://www2.clarku.edu/offices/ois/computerpolicy.html">OIS Computer Policy page 
  </a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#993333">Secure Transmissions</font></b> </p>
<p>Using an easy point and click interface, we've developed some sections of the 
  site where you can enter your credit card number or bank information and submit 
  it to us. </p>
<p>Clark does not collect or assemble personal information for sale. The information 
  is transmitted using the latest encryption technology with today's browsers 
  and housed by a third-party affiliate. We strongly feel that your information 
  should be kept on a server that specializes in 24-hour security and do everything 
  we can to ensure we protect our visitors. Access is only given to those qualified 
  professionals who are assigned the job of meeting your requests. </p>
