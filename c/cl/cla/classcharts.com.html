This Policy applies to the Personal Data that we collect from you when you submit information to us via the Website or during the registration process.&nbsp;This policy does not apply to the information that the System stores or holds about any school staff, pupils or parents which is stored in accordance with our terms and conditions, which can be found at https://www.edukey.co.uk/edukey-terms-conditions/ and our Information Sharing agreement with the relevant school.<br> 3.3. For the purposes of applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements, we are a Data Controller and therefore we are responsible for, and control the processing of, your Personal Data in accordance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements. “Personal Data” has a legal definition but, in brief, it refers to information from which a living person can be identified. Such information must be protected in accordance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements.<br> <strong>4. Information we may collect about you</strong><br> 4.1.

However, some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually.

Occasionally we may receive information about you from other sources, for example from any third party websites and applications that integrate or communicate with the Website in relation to you.

From 25 May 2018, under applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements we may only process your Information if we have a “legal basis” (i.e. a legally permitted reason) for doing so. For the purposes of this Policy, our legal basis for processing your Information is:<br> 6.1.1. your consent (for which see clause 7 below); or<br> 6.1.2. because the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract you have entered into with us (i.e. your contract with us as set out in this Policy and our website terms and conditions available at https://www.edukey.co.uk/edukey-terms-conditions/ or for taking any preliminary steps that are required before you can enter into such a contract (provided we only do this at your request); or<br> 6.1.3. subject to your rights set out in clause 15 below, the legitimate interest of providing services to our users through the Website, which requires the processing of your Information to enable us to provide these services.<br> <strong>7.

You can do this through your account on the Website or by notifying us in writing (see clause 21 below).<br> 7.3.

You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, for example where a computer algorithm (rather than a person) makes decisions which affect your contractual rights. Please note that this right is not available in all circumstances. If you request this right and it is not available to you we will let you know.<br> 15.8. You have the right to object to direct marketing, for which see clause 9.4 above.<br> <strong>16.
