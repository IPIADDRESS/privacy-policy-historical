                  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                  <p><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong><br><br>
                    Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment 
                    to combine quality products and services with integrity in 
                    dealing with our users. The Policy is designed to assist you 
                    in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal 
                    information you provide to us and to assist you in making 
                    informed decisions when using our site and our products and 
                    services.</p>
                  <p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
                    <p>When you visit our site you may provide us with two types of information:  personal information you actively choose to disclose ("Active Information") and use information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and others browse our site ("Passive Information").</p>
                  <p><strong>No Use of Our Site by Persons Under 13</strong></p>
                    <p><em>No person under 13 should disclose information on this 
                    site</em>. You may learn more about protecting children's 
                    privacy online by visiting <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy</a>. </p>
                  <p><strong>Active Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p> 
                    <p>In order to gain use of the site (become a “user”), 
                    we require you to disclose the following information:</p>
                  <p> <em>(full name, address, email, phone, business name for 
                    member signup, credit card number, credit card exp date and 
                    billing address in the payment form)</em></p>
                  <p>We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the 
                    transmission of credit card and billing information you submit 
                    to us when you use our secure online payment forms. The information 
                    you provide to us is stored securely.</p>
                  <p>If you choose to post information on our site or maintain 
                    email, snailmail or telephone contact with us, we may retain 
                    such information also and its transmission via email is not 
                    secured.</p>
                  <p> <strong>Passive Information Collected </strong></p>
                  <p><strong>What is a Cookie?</strong></p>
                  <p>Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape 
                    Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize 
                    the computer used to access a site. They are small pieces 
                    of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on one 
                    site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by 
                    the same user or to use the information to streamline the 
                    user’s transaction on related web pages. This makes 
                    it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete 
                    transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online 
                    experience easier and more personalized.</p>
                  <p>Our site utilizes cookies to collect information about how 
                    our site is used. Passive Information gathered may include 
                    the date and time of visits, the site pages viewed, time spent 
                    at our site, the sites visited just before and just after 
                    our site. If you do not wish to transmit “cookie” 
                    information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function 
                    in your web browser; please consult the “Help” 
                    section of your browser to correctly do so. </p>
                  <p>Our site’s servers also automatically identify your 
                    computer by its Internet Protocol address, which is a unique 
                    string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your 
                    Internet Service Provider. Your IP address may be used to 
                    address problems with our server or administer our site or 
                    to gather broad demographic information about our users.</p>
                  <p><strong>How Do We Use the Information Collected?</strong></p>
                  <p>Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors 
                    or agents at our direction, use Active Information for purposes 
                    of administering our business activities, providing customer 
                    services such as support, and making available other products 
                    or services we think may be of interest to our users. We may 
                    use the Active Information or Passive Information you provide 
                    to us to contact you about changes to our site, new services, 
                    features or products we offer, or other information we think 
                    you shall find valuable. If at any time you do not wish to 
                    receive such information, you may “opt-out” of 
                    doing so by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:service@classifiedflyerads.com">service@classifiedflyerads.com</a>.</p>
                  <p>We use Passive Information to gather information about our 
                    users and to enhance and design our site to make it easier, 
                    faster and friendlier to use. Additionally, cookies help us 
                    know information about how many people visit our site, when 
                    they visit and how they use our service. Passive Information 
                    may result in your viewing of particular advertising based 
                    on your user habits for your viewing on our site and a shopping 
                    experience customized to you in content, services and goods.</p>
                  <p><strong>Your Information In Relation to Others We Link To</strong></p>
                  <p>You may be able to access other websites through our site. 
                    When you do so you are doing so subject to their policies 
                    regarding privacy and data collection and you should read 
                    those sites’ privacy policies to make sure you agree 
                    to them before using such sites. When you choose to shop at 
                    such sites, you should read their privacy policies to make 
                    sure you agree to them before making purchases.</p>
                  <p><strong>Sharing Information with Advertisers or Other Third 
                    Parties</strong></p>
                  <p>We may disclose anonymous information about user habits, 
                    characteristics and user patterns, based on aggregate user 
                    statistics to advertisers on our site. The parties who perform 
                    services for us (credit card processors, merchant bank, our 
                    Internet Service Provider) may also have access to your information 
                    in performing such services. Should we buy or sell assets 
                    of our company, another company may need to review our company’s 
                    assets, including your information, to make business decisions 
                    as to whether to acquire such assets. </p>
                  <p><strong>Sharing Information with the Government or As Otherwise 
                    Required by Law</strong></p>
                  <p>We may be required by subpoena, law or government agency 
                    to disclose both Active and Passive Information you have provided 
                    to us.</p>
                  <p> <strong>How Do We Secure Active Information and Passive 
                    Information?</strong></p>
                  <p>We secure your personal information submitted by you by using 
                    reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, 
                    or accidental loss or destruction of Active Information and 
                    Passive Information. Your postings on this site and other 
                    communications you may have with us via email or snailmail 
                    may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures 
                    are in place prior to your sending information. Therefore, 
                    if you choose to communicate with us through these means, 
                    you are assuming the risk of doing so and we request that 
                    you do not send or post sensitive information through these 
                    means.</p>
                  <p><strong>How Can You Choose Not to Receive Information About 
                    Products or Services By Us or to Correct, Delete or Access 
                    Your Information</strong></p>
                  <p>If you desire not to receive information about products or 
                    services we think may be of interest to you or if you wish 
                    to access, delete or correct you information, please send 
                    us an email to <a href="mailto:service@classifiedflyerads.com">service@classifiedflyerads.com</a>.
