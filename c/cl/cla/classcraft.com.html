<p>Classcraft has developed this Privacy Policy to let users know in general terms about Classcraft’s personal information management practices, including what personal information is collected and how it is processed and used. If users have any questions about our Privacy Policy they may contact Classcraft at <a href="mailto:wecare@classcraft.com">wecare@classcraft.com</a>.</p>
