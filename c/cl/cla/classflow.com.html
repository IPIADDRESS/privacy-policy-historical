Please read them carefully before you start to use our Service. By using our Service, you indicate that you accept the ClassFlow Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, Cookies Policy and this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by and abide by the terms of all of them. If you do not agree to these terms and policies, please do not use the Service. "You" or “your” is defined as an Individual User of the Service. An Individual User may be a teacher/educator, a student, or a parent. Where applicable, “you” or “your” may also be defined as a school or school district or other educational institution otherwise known as an “Enterprise User”, with whom the Individual User is associated either as a student, teacher/educator, or parent of a student. Individual Users purchasing from, downloading from, or uploading/posting to our Service on behalf of an Enterprise User agree that they do so with the appropriate permissions and authority. The term “User(s)” will refer to Individual Users and Enterprise Users.</p>
<p>Remember that your use of Promethean's Service is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any terms we use here without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<h2>What is the Purpose of this Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>Promethean respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This ClassFlow Privacy Policy (together with our <a href="terms-of-service">ClassFlow Terms of Service</a> and <a href="acceptable-use-policy">ClassFlow Acceptable Use Policy</a>&nbsp;and any other documents referred to on it) explains how Promethean collects, holds, uses and discloses any personal or other information that we collect from you and from third parties or that you otherwise provide to us.&nbsp; Please read the following carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal and non-personal information and how we will treat it. This policy does not apply to third party websites or applications to which we provide links from our Service.</p>
<p>“Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy means information or an opinion about an identified individual, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not. This includes your name, names of family members, your address, your telephone number, your e-mail address, your screen name or user name, a photograph, video or audio file, information about a child or his/her parents, or personal unique identifiers such as your social security number (US persons only) or date of birth. It also includes sensitive information such as race or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership in political associations, physical or mental health or condition, membership in a government program, philosophical beliefs, membership in a professional or trade association or union, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, genetic information, and biometric information (“Sensitive Personal Information”).</p>
<p>The information we collect and hold about you depends on who you are, including whether you are a teacher, student or parent.</p>
<h2>What Personal Information is collected from Users of the Service?</h2>
<p>We collect and store the information that you knowingly enter on the Service, whether via computer, mobile phone, or other wireless device or that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include, without limitation, Personal Information such as your name, user name, e-mail address, phone number, school affiliation and location, billing and payment information, and any other information necessary for us to provide our Services. If the Service is obtained by an educational establishment for the use of its teachers/educators and students (an “Enterprise User”), that Customer may wish for the Service to integrate with the Customer’s Student Information System (SIS). In those instances, we will collect and store only that information from the Customer SIS which the Enterprise Customer provides to us and that is necessary for the purposes of providing the Service. The SIS may contain Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information about each student in the school or district including, but not limited to, parents’ names, students’ class schedules, students’ grades, students’ dates of birth, gender, race and students’ school identification numbers. By using the Service you agree to and authorize any such collection of Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information from the Enterprise User’s SIS for the purposes of providing the Service. Personal Information of Individual Users may also be provided by a teacher or parent or guardian. By using the Service, you agree to and authorize this collection of information.</p>
<p>If we determine that we have collected Personal Information from or about a student without their required parental/guardian consent or that a student has provided us more Personal Information than we requested from him or her, we will take reasonable steps to destroy that information securely and as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com">support@ClassFlow.com<script type="text/javascript">

<h2>What does Promethean use my Personal Information for?</h2>
<p>When you register an account on ClassFlow.com, we collect some Personal Information such as your name and e-mail address which is used to (i) create your individual account, (ii) administer your use of the Service including responding to your requests for certain information and services, (iii) better understand your needs and interest, (iv) personalize and improve your Service, (v) provide or offer updates and product announcements, (vi) tell you about opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you, (vii) provide you with information about the promotions, competitions, products, and services we offer (please see <a href="http://www.classflow.com/">www.classflow.com</a> for the terms and conditions relating to any promotions and competitions associated with the Service), and (vii) provide and share information with your school/employer, teacher and/or parent or guardian as applicable. We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Your district, school, teacher(s) and parent/guardian (as applicable) may have access to your Personal Information through your profile page and the Service. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.</p>
<h2>To whom does Promethean disclose my Personal Information?</h2>
<p>You may use a third party application to access or log on to your ClassFlow account such as Facebook or Google. Promethean is not responsible for what those third parties do with your information so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you. Promethean will not share your Personal Information with Facebook or Google without your consent.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information as required or authorized by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us; enforce or apply our Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy and other agreements (including to disclose Personal Information to law enforcement, your school or your employer); or protect the rights, property, or safety of Promethean, our employees, our Users, or others.</p>
<p>If Promethean or some or all of its assets were acquired or otherwise transferred, or in the unlikely event that Promethean would go out of business or enter bankruptcy, User information including Personal Information may be transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p>We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze and improve the Service, including but not limited to, data storage, maintenance services, database management, Web analytics, payment processing and improvement of the Service’s features.&nbsp; Information received and/or collected by ClassFlow is stored on servers owned by Amazon Web Services, Inc. located in the United States, and is subject to lawful access requests by authorities in the United States.&nbsp; These trusted third parties may have access to your Personal Information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. By way of example only, we may use one of our trusted third party companies to analyze, collect, and provide to us the e-mail addresses of all Users who have not used the Service in a certain time period.&nbsp; If you are one of those Users, we may send you an e-mail telling you about a new feature we have added since you last visited the site or encouraging you to give us another try. Similarly, and by way of example only, we may use one of these trusted third parties to analyze, collect, and provide to us the e-mail addresses of all those Users who have uploaded/posted at least thirty (30) User Submissions in the last six (6) months.&nbsp; If you are one of those Users, we might e-mail a survey to you in order to get your feedback on which features you like most or what you would like to see changed about the Service. Of course, should we send you direct marketing communications such as &nbsp;those email examples provided above, you will always have the opportunity to easily unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving those communications by following the unsubscribe instructions on the email itself which shall be easy to understand and cost-free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of the date of this policy, we use Amazon Web Services, Inc., Google Analytics, KiSSmetrics, Pardot, and Get Satisfaction to provide some or all of these tasks. To learn more about the these third party companies including the privacy policy of each of these third parties,</p>

<p>In addition to the information which you provide to us, we also automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Service.&nbsp; For example, Promethean automatically receives and records usage information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Promethean cookie information (see below), and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Service, and the number and frequency of visits to our site and its components including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, and the resources that you access.&nbsp; If you contact us, we may also keep a record of that correspondence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you download our mobile application, we automatically collect information on the type of device, name and version of the operating system, name and version of the application, whether the currently logged in User is a teacher, student, or other user type, the numerical mobile device user ID, as well as actions performed by the User in accessing the mobile application (“Mobile Usage Information,” which is considered part of “usage information” as described above). However, we do not ask you for, access or track any geographic-location-based information from your mobile device (i.e., any information regarding where your mobile device is located on the globe at a particular time) at any time while downloading or using our mobile applications. For clarity, this does not prevent us from asking you the school with which you are affiliated.</p>
<h2>What does Promethean use Other Information for?</h2>
<p>Promethean or Promethean’s trusted third party companies described above, may collect information about your computer, including where available, your IP address, operating system, and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information (how groups of people use the Service). This is statistical data about our Users’ actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. We may collect and analyze this aggregate data on how the Service is used for the purpose of improving and enhancing the Service, increasing our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness.</p>
<p>In addition to data used in the aggregate, we may also collect individual User data for the purpose of determining how often you use the Service or don’t use the Service or which features you use the most or use the least for the purpose of improving the Service and improving your experience using the Service. Additionally, individual usage of the system, including but not limited to individual IP addresses, may be analyzed on a case-specific basis to resolve a technical difficulty or to assist in resolving or investigating any misuse of the Service. Promethean may share the aggregate data collected with a third party but not any Personal Information about any individual User without your express permission. We may also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile application and mobile site on your phone. The information collected for the purposes set forth in this paragraph is in a non-personally identifiable format.</p>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or mobile device to enable our systems to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.&nbsp; To understand exactly what cookies are used on our Service, please click here to review our <a href="cookies-policy">ClassFlow Cookies Policy</a>. Our third party service providers may also transmit cookies to your computer or device to help provide you with an optimal online experience. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we do not have access or control over such cookies.</p>

</ul><h2>Is Information About Me Secure?</h2>
<p>Promethean takes precautions to maintain the security and integrity of Personal Information it collects about you, including storage of your Personal Information on a secure server behind multiple firewalls.</p>
<p>Promethean uses industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology) encryption to transfer sensitive and Personal Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and although we take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information, Promethean cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the site, whether transmitted to Promethean by you, the educational institution, or the teacher. Once we receive your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. We consider these security safeguards to be reasonable in the circumstances</p>
<p>By agreeing to the ClassFlow Privacy Policy, you agree to use the Service at your own risk, and agree (to the maximum extent permitted by law) that Promethean shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a third party, whether by Promethean, the educational institution, a teacher, or an unauthorized third party. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service.</p>
<p>In order to access any Personal Information, you must set up an account which is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We also use coding practices which take steps to prevent attack on our Services from Web browsers and malicious scripts, by processing all actions through several permission verifications checks.</p>
<p>You can help protect against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p>The Service may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites (but you should read those third parties’ privacy policies to ensure you understand them). This Privacy Policy only governs information collected by Promethean via the Service.</p>

<p>Please be advised that requesting removal of or not providing certain information may result in you not receiving notification of updates to the Service or other valuable information regarding your use of the Service.

<h2>Will Promethean ever Change this Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time for any reason. If we make any material changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you via email or by posting an announcement on the Service. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy, a parent or guardian of a student who is accessing the Service must provide a new written parental/guardian consent to the child’s teacher and/or educational institution in order for the child to continue accessing the Service. The date this Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the beginning of the Policy.</p>
<h2>What if I am from a Country other than the United States of America?</h2>
<p>When you use the Services, you are consenting to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States. It may be processed by staff who work for Promethean or staff who work for one of our third party suppliers. All of the servers used to provide the Service are currently located in the United States, and we aren’t able to process your information within the borders of any other country. Given this limitation, if your use of the Service or disclosure of certain information to Promethean (or to our third party service providers) would violate any law that is applicable to you, your right to use the Services and/or disclose such information is revoked, as it is wherever use of the Services is prohibited by law (as described in the ClassFlow Terms of Service).</p>
