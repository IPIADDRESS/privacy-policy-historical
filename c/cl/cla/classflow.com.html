<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(Version 3.0 – April 2015)</strong><br><strong>Effective Date:&nbsp; April 21, 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is eighteen (18) years), your parent or guardian must read these terms and agree to them prior to your using the Service. </em></p>
<p>“ClassFlow” or the “Service" is provided by Promethean Limited (“Promethean”, "we", or "us", or "our"). &nbsp;We are a limited company registered in England and Wales with our registered office at Promethean Limited, Promethean House, Lower Philips Road, Whitebirk Industrial Estate, Blackburn, Lancashire, BB1 5TH, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>When we use the word “Service(s)” in this <a href="/about/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, we mean the public ClassFlow website available for use at no cost ("free") as well as all the other related websites, products, services, and applications made available by Promethean (including the ClassFlow Student App and the ClassFlow Teacher App available via the iTunes Store and Google Play store).&nbsp; If your school or district purchased the fee-based ClassFlow For Schools service, this Privacy Policy does not apply to you.&nbsp; If you are not sure whether this Privacy Policy applies to you, then for the avoidance of doubt, if you are required to go to a URL which includes the name of your school or district similar to the following in order to access your ClassFlow account, www.yourschooldistrict name.classflow.com, or you were provided an account by your school or district, this Privacy Policy is not applicable to you.&nbsp; Contact your school or district for a copy of the Privacy Policy that is applicable to you and your school. &nbsp;If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <span><a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com">support@ClassFlow.com</a></span>.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the <a href="/about/cookies-policy.html">ClassFlow Cookies Policy</a>, <a href="/about/terms-of-service.html">ClassFlow Terms of Service</a>, and <a href="/about/acceptable-use-policy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>&nbsp;referred to in this Privacy Policy, form a legally binding Contract between you and us (collectively referred to herein as the “Contract”). &nbsp;Please read them carefully before you start to use our Service. &nbsp;By using our Service, you indicate that you consent to accept the ClassFlow Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, Cookies Policy, and this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by and abide by the terms of all of them. &nbsp;If you do not agree to these terms and policies, please do not use the Service. &nbsp;"You" or “your” is defined as an Individual User of the Service. An Individual User may be a teacher/educator, a student, or a parent. Remember that your use of Promethean's Service is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any terms we use here without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the Purpose of this Privacy Policy?<br></span></strong>Promethean respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.&nbsp; This ClassFlow Privacy Policy (together with our ClassFlow Terms of Service, ClassFlow Acceptable Use Policy, and any other documents referred to on it) explains how Promethean collects, holds, uses, and discloses any Personal Information that we collect from you through your use of the ClassFlow Service.&nbsp; “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy means any personally identifiable information about Individual Users of the Service collected for the purposes of providing you the Service.<br><br>This policy does not apply to third party websites or practices of companies that Promethean does not own or control, or applications to which we provide links from our Service. &nbsp;You should always read the privacy policy of any third party websites before using them.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Personal Information is collected from Users of this Free Service?<br></span></strong>The Personal Information we collect in the free ClassFlow Service depends on whether you are a teacher or a student:<br><br><strong>a.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Personal Information is collected about Teachers or Other Adults</span>?<br>If you are a Teacher or you are 18 years or older, you can register for a free ClassFlow account. &nbsp;When you register for a ClassFlow account, we collect and store the information that you knowingly enter on the Service, whether via computer, mobile phone, or other wireless device. This information may include Personal Information such as your first and last name, User name, password, e-mail address, school affiliation and location, what grades you teach, what subject matter you teach, and your job title or role. &nbsp;You should not enter other personal information that is not requested by the Service.<br><br><strong>b.&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Personal Information is collected about Students</span>?<br>Students are prohibited from registering for an account on the free ClassFlow Service. &nbsp;If we determine that a Student has registered for a ClassFlow account, we will make that account inaccessible immediately, and we will take reasonable steps to destroy any information in that account securely and as quickly as possible. If you believe that a Student has registered for an account on ClassFlow or may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com">support@ClassFlow.com</a><a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com.">.<br><br></a>Since the free Service does not contain a Student registration page, the only Personal Information we may knowingly collect and store on the free ClassFlow Service about the Student is any Personal Information that is disclosed by the Teacher in any of the Teacher’s lessons created in ClassFlow or when he or she creates a class roster in the Teacher’s ClassFlow account. &nbsp;(For example, the Teacher uses the Student’s first and last name to identify the Student in that roster).&nbsp; If the Teacher does not disclose any Personal Information about any Students in the Teacher’s ClassFlow account (for example, the Teacher identifies the Student generically such as “Period 2 Biology Student #1” when creating the class roster), then no Personal Information is collected about a Student in the Teacher’s ClassFlow account.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements of Teachers Using the Free Service:<br><br></span></strong><strong>a.</strong> If you are a Teacher located in the United States, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) which requires you or the educational institution for which you work to obtain advance written permission from a parent or guardian whose children are under the age of eighteen (18) years in order to release any Personal Information from a student’s education record to a third party. For more information on FERPA, please see <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>.<br><br><strong>b.&nbsp;</strong>If you are a Teacher located in the United States, you further represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with the Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA applies to the online collection of Personal Information from children under thirteen (13) years of age. &nbsp;Before disclosing any Personal Information about a child under the age of thirteen (13) years, COPPA requires that you or the educational institution for which you work obtain advance written permission from a parent or guardian. &nbsp;When obtaining such consent, you must also provide parents/guardians with a copy of or link to this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;For more information on COPPA, please see <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy">ftc.gov/privacy</a>.<br><br><strong>c.</strong><strong> </strong>Since you are responsible for complying with FERPA and COPPA, if you release or disclose any Personal Information about any of your Students that are under the age of eighteen (18) years in your ClassFlow account (for example, you create a class roster within your ClassFlow account using your Students’ first and last names), then you represent and warrant that you or the educational institution for which you work has obtained advance written permission from the Students’ parents or guardians to disclose that <br> Personal Information to ClassFlow. When obtaining such consent, you must also provide parents/guardians with a copy of or link to this Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide a copy to us upon our request. &nbsp;For a sample consent form see <a href="http://www.classflow.com/sampleparentalconsent">classflow.com/sampleparentalconsent</a>.<br><br><strong>d.&nbsp;</strong>If you do not disclose any Personal Information about your Students into your ClassFlow account (for example, you create a class roster within your ClassFlow account that does not identify a particular student by first and or last name but instead identifies a student by using generic non-identifying information such as “Period 2 Biology Student No. 1.”), then you are not required to obtain parental consent.<br><br><strong>e.&nbsp;</strong>If you are located outside the United States, you are required to comply with the Terms of this Privacy Policy and all regulations and laws governing the privacy of children and children’s Personal Information in your territory. You represent and warrant that you are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws governing the protection of Personal Information and the sharing of student education records.<br><br><strong>f.&nbsp;</strong>If you are a Teacher located in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, or Germany, before using ClassFlow, you have to clarify if you have to obtain permission from the administration of the educational institution you are working for in case any Personal Information from Students may be collected, used, or stored on your device. If you do not obtain the necessary permission, you are not allowed to use the Service. In addition, Personal Information needs to be stored safely on your device (for example, password-protected backup on separate hard disk) to avoid misuse. &nbsp;Moreover, you have to ensure that only Personal Information of Students collected, used, or stored on your device is duly required to teach your courses. &nbsp;In the event of uncertainty, please ask the administration of the educational institution for which you are working. &nbsp;In all matters under this section, you could also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com">support@ClassFlow.com</a> if you need further information.<br><br><strong>g.&nbsp;</strong>If we determine that a Teacher has disclosed a Student’s Personal Information within their ClassFlow account without first obtaining the required parental/guardian consent, we will take reasonable steps to destroy that information securely and as quickly as possible, and we may suspend or terminate the Teacher’s account. If you believe that a Teacher may have provided us Personal Information about a Student or Students in violation of this paragraph please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com">support@ClassFlow.com</a><a href="mailto:support@ClassFlow.com.">.<br><br></a><strong>h. </strong>We do not monitor, review, or exercise any control over the User Submissions (as defined in the ClassFlow Terms of Service) uploaded or shared when using the Service (though we reserve the right to block or take down any User Submissions that we reasonably believe may subject Promethean or our Users to liability) (See the ClassFlow Terms of Service regarding User Submissions, and see the ClassFlow Acceptable Use Policy). Accordingly, we encourage you to avoid including Personal Information about yourself, your Students, or others in your User Submissions, and we encourage you to talk with your Students about not including Personal Information in any resource or material used in connection with this Service.</li>

<li><strong> </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is Information About Me Secure?<br></span></strong>Promethean takes precautions to maintain the security and integrity of Personal Information it collects about you including storage of your Personal Information on a secure server behind multiple firewalls.<br><br><strong>a.&nbsp;</strong><strong> </strong>Promethean uses industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology) encryption to transfer sensitive and Personal Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and although we take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information, Promethean cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the site, whether transmitted to Promethean by you, the educational institution, or the Teacher. &nbsp;Once we receive your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. &nbsp;We consider these security safeguards to be reasonable and in line with evolving good industry practice.<br><br><strong>b.&nbsp;</strong>By agreeing to the ClassFlow Privacy Policy, you agree to use the Service at your own risk, and agree (to the maximum extent permitted by law) that Promethean shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a third party, whether by Promethean, the educational institution, a Teacher, or an unauthorized third party. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service.<br><br><strong>c.&nbsp;</strong>In order to access any Personal Information, you must set up an account which is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We also use coding practices which take steps to prevent attack on our Services from Web browsers and malicious scripts by processing all actions through several permission verifications checks.<br><br><strong>d.&nbsp;</strong>You can help protect against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.<br><br><strong>e.&nbsp;</strong>The Service may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites (but you should read those third parties’ privacy policies to ensure you understand them).
