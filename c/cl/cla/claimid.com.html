      <p>The information collected by claimID.com will be used for in-house service analysis and academic research.  Basically, this means that we will study anonymized samples of information from claimID.com.  The important thing for you to know is the data we study will not identify you personally.

We are bound by very strict institutional guidelines when we use claimID.com data for research, so please know that maintaining your privacy is our utmost concern.</p>

      <p>Unless they opt in, claimID.com users will not receive announcements from us.  We may provide users the ability to opt-in to communications from claimID.com, but we will never contact you unless you opt-in to these communications.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Information Storage and Control</strong>
      <p>When a user deletes their account from claimID.com, all of their information is expunged from our systems.  Of course, our backups may contain older copies of the information, but we expunge backups regularly.  We believe that you control your information, and we absolutely respect that.</p>
      </li>
