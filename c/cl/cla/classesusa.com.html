The information is stored on your computer's hard drive and provides a number of conveniences for you. We may set and access cookies on your computer to provide you with customized content and to assist in providing the services that you have requested.

Like many Web sites, We may automatically track information based upon your behavior on Our Web sites. We may combine information that We obtain through the use of cookies with Personal Information, other aggregate or anonymous data, including a unique ID We may assign you.

<p> <strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br>
We maintain electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Information. We protect Information about you over the Internet by using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs (such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with Our web server via an encrypted session. We employ a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and Us. The 128 bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cyphertext to safeguard sensitive information during its journey across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination. Depending on which browser you use, you will know you are in secured area by "https" or a lock appearing in the lower right hand corner of your browser window. When you visit Our Web site, you may move in and out of secured areas. </p>

By using Our Web site, you consent to any transfer of Information outside of your country, should We find it necessary. </p>
<p> In the event that We are acquired or merge with another company, or upon a sale of all or portion of Our assets, Information about you will be among the assets transferred to the new company. The new company may handle such Information in accordance with its own policies and procedures and not in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
