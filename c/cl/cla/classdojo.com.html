          <a class="anchor" id="WhatIsClassDojo"></a><h3>What is ClassDojo?</h3>
          <p>
            ClassDojo is a classroom management platform that helps teachers encourage students and easily engage parents. In the classroom, teachers can use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “<a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a>”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork and leadership. This can be done through either the ClassDojo App or the ClassDojo Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync up automatically!  To make family engagement easier than ever before, teachers can instantly message with parents, and can let them see how their child is doing at school by sharing his or her student profile to highlight the feedback points they earned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents get access to ClassDojo using a <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730289" target="_blank">unique code</a> provided by the child’s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher. Parents can only view their own children’s profiles and not those of any other students. Students can also create their own account, but only after they receive a <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145" target="_blank">unique code</a> from their teacher and (if the student is under 13) have received parental consent or notice (as applicable) in order to access certain features of their account. In the student account, students can, for example, see feedback given by their teacher, as well as customize their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo.
          </p>
          <p>
            When students set up a ClassDojo account using a unique code, they need to submit a unique username and password. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we ask for their age, and if they are under 13 years of age, we also ask for a parent or guardian’s email address to request parental consent. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information.
          </p>

            ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145" target="_blank">unique code</a> they have been given by their teacher (students cannot sign up without this), a unique username (we advise students to not use their real name) and password. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent or notice purposes to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. Beyond this, the ClassDojo student account does not allow the student the ability to upload any content to their account or enter any additional personal information. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "<a class="depress-on-click" href="#InformationCollectedAutomatically">Information Collected Automatically</a>" section.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, or as required by law or to enforce our Terms. We will not require children to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to <a class="depress-on-click" href="#ServiceProviders">service providers</a> necessary to provide the Service, as required by <a class="depress-on-click" href="#LegalRequirements">law</a> or to protect the security of our Service or other users. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is <strong>never</strong> used or disclosed for third party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children’s personal information is <strong>never</strong> sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that we also receive from the child’s teacher whatever name he or she has provided for the student, and the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> assigned by that teacher. Teachers may choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; teachers can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name, only initials, or even just seat numbers).

            ClassDojo may send push notifications to students - for example, letting them know when their weekly report is ready or possibly of an achievement they reached! We will require a child to provide a parent email address before he or she can receive push notifications from ClassDojo. We will then provide the parent with notice of our collection and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. The device identifier for these children will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer wish for these communications to be sent, either turn off the push notifications on your device directly or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.

            No student profiles are made available or visible to the public, or to other students, through ClassDojo. Teachers may <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202027909" target="_blank">share their classes</a>, including <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a>, with other teachers they co-teach with in their school, to help them collaborate. If the teacher chooses to display ClassDojo in their classroom, such as projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard, students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names, avatar (which can be default avatars, or avatars modified by students) and aggregated total feedback points (similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work). Students' full profiles showing each feedback point awarded are not shown in this class view (just the avatar, if modified by the student, is shown), and are therefore kept private for each student, their teacher, and their parents. Teachers can of course choose not to display ClassDojo this way, for example by using the ClassDojo App — and many do!

            <a class="anchor" id="HowLongDoesClassDojoKeepChildrensInformation"></a><strong>How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?</strong><br>
            We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as the student account is <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">active</a>, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our users and our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just children’s) information (<strong>“3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”</strong>):
            </p><ol>
              <li><p><strong>Minimal information:</strong>
                As mentioned before, ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide just the unique student code given by their teacher (students cannot sign up without this), a username, and a password. We  advise students to not use any personal information in their username. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we ask students for their age, and a parent or guardian email address if they are under 13 years of age so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). Beyond this, the ClassDojo student account does not allow the student the ability to upload any content to their account or enter any additional personal information. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "<a class="depress-on-click" href="#InformationCollectedAutomatically">Information Collected Automatically</a>" section.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>One year deletion policy for feedback points:</strong><br>
                To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> on student profiles are retained. For all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted - unless the student or their parent chooses to retain them by creating their own associated account. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2016, unless students or parents create accounts, on January 1, 2017, any feedback points given in that class on or before January 1, 2016 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age). This means feedback points cannot exist long-term without either being deleted automatically, or students or parents knowing about them and being able to access and delete them on their own (by deleting both the parent and student account entirely)! Teachers can delete feedback points at anytime.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Deleting inactive accounts:</strong><br>
                If a student’s account is <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">inactive</a> for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student or messaged with the student’s parent, and neither the parent nor the student have logged into his or her account), ClassDojo will delete the student account, automatically deleting personal information provided by students or collected by ClassDojo from students, as well as feedback points associated with the account that are more than 12 months old.

The types and amounts of information collected through the use of ClassDojo will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, parent or student (e.g. we collect minimal information from students) and how they use ClassDojo (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).

            There are currently three categories of users on our Service: teachers, parents, and students. We describe the information collected from students under 13 in the section <a class="depress-on-click" href="#WhatInformationDoesClassDojoCollectFromChildrenAndHowIsItUsed">above</a>; for other users, we collect and store the following different types of information from each type of user:

                </strong>
                  To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo. If you create a ClassDojo account as a student, you will be asked to enter the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145" target="_blank">unique code</a> you have been given by your teacher (students are unable to sign up for the Service without this), along with a unique username and password. Per COPPA, we may also ask for your age and, if you are under 13, a parent or guardian’s email address so we can give parents notice or seek parental consent as appropriate. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information, and students currently cannot enter any additional personal information through the use of our Service. Teacher profiles may be viewed by other teachers in the same school. No teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.

                  If you are a teacher, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you. By connecting with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers within the same school such as sharing information about student feedback points.

                  As a teacher you’ll need to enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class (these may or may not be the student’s actual first and last names - it is entirely the teacher’s choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter ‘John S’, ‘John’, ‘JS’, or ‘Student 23’ to describe the same person). If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers in their school, such as those that they co-teach with, then the other teachers can also see that class’s information.

                  As a teacher, you can invite the parents of your students to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS). As a parent or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.

These feedback points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s feedback points can be viewed through the Service by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s parents, and other teachers the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points).

                  As a teacher you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309" target="_blank">ClassDojo Messaging</a> feature. Teachers and parents can send each other messages, which can also include things such as photos, voice notes and virtual stickers. As a teacher or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message. We will store messages, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers keep a log of their communications with parents.

Like many services, ClassDojo uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.<br>
                  Please read our <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204430505" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings.

          <p>
            When you delete your account, we delete your profile information and any other content you provide in your profile (such as your name, username, password, email address, and profile photos) and depending on the category of user you are (i.e. teacher, parent or student), <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> and information collected through the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422195" target="_blank">mobile permissions</a> you’ve granted.

More specifically, we have a <a class="depress-on-click" href="#HowLongDoesClassDojoKeepChildrensInformation">3-Tiered Student Data Protection Policy</a> to protect students’ information: we collect minimal information from students, delete feedback points automatically after 1 year if there are no associated parent or student accounts, and delete student accounts if they are <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">inactive</a> for 1 year.
