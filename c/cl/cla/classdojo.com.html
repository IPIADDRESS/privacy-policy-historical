Overview of this Privacy Policy</h2><p>This Privacy Policy explains how Company collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including Company's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of any Personal Information that Company's business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a Company application. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p></div></div><br><div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"><h2>2. Treatment of Children’s Personal Information</h2><p>If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian's express consent. Company collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information"), but only where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with Company to collect Children's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. Company requires schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students' parents before collecting any such Children's Personal Information. If you are a student, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Website, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, or that a student's school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@classdojo.com">hello@classdojo.com</a>.</p><p>Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants. References to "Children's Personal Information" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General references to "information" shall apply to all users.</p><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if you are a student registrant and your parent has signed up for the Website with an access code provided by your teacher, you understand that your parent can view all information within or associated with your Website account, including without limitation messages between you and your teacher and grades you received on assignments.</p></div></div><br><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"><h2>3. Nature of Information Collected or Displayed by Company</h2><p>When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, add classes and students, send messages, award points, and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user ("User Category") you are, and as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior points you have given, or easily see your class lists. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.</p><p>If you are under 13 you may only view other members of your class invited by your teachers, and if you are a parent you may review your child’s behavioral progress.</p><p><b>Information You Provide to Us:</b></p><p>We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way.

You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. The Children's Personal Information you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account and for sending you Notifications. You may modify or remove your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information identified below at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.</p><p>If you choose to invite other teachers to the site, we will ask for their name and email address. We will automatically send them a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the purpose of not sending multiple invitations to the same teacher from different users.</p><p><b>Information Collected Automatically:</b></p><p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services.

Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to determine how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site.

Company uses this confirmation to help make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our non-student user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you no longer wish to receive email communications or sms communications you may opt-out by following the link provided at the bottom of each communication, emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@classdojo.com">hello@classdojo.com</a>, or by replying STOP to the sms message.</p></div></div><br><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"><h2>4.
