Together we can help foster a set of character strengths that are critical to each student’s lifelong success, however they may define it."},"parentsignup":{"title":"ClassDojo Parent Login Info Page","account_allows":"ClassDojo parent accounts allow you to follow your child's behavioral progress.","two_ways":"There are 2 ways to get a parent account","ask_teacher":"Ask your child's teacher for an email invite","or":"or","code":"Ask your child's teacher for a parent account code","enter_code":"If you have a parent account code, you can enter it at","questions":"If you have any questions, please let us know:","support":"ClassDojo parent support","cheers":"Cheers","new_here":"I don't have a parent code","have_code":"I have a parent account code","have_account":"I already have an account","login_here":"If you've already created a parent account, you can login at"}},"website3":{"cecily":"Cecily uses ClassDojo to build positive behavior with her students","students":"Students: Enter your code!","parents":"Parents: Enter your code!","tessa":"Tessa uses ClassDojo to message her class’s parents","emmalee":"ClassDojo helps Emmalee show her parents how well she's doing in class","kristen":"Kristen uses ClassDojo to message her class’s parents","jordan":"Jordan uses ClassDojo to create a positive classroom culture","works":"Works with any classroom, any device, and is free for teachers."}}},"locale":"en-US"});      </script> <script type="text/javascript">var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-25121690-1']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

As used in this Policy, Personal Information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">We generally collect a very limited set of information, only what we need to make ClassDojo useful to you and to other users: things like your registration and profile information. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p><strong>Children's Personal Information</strong>: As required by the law and our Terms, if you are under the age of 13, you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian's express consent. We ask users to verify their age when they sign up, and we collect only very limited Personal Information –users choose their own username and password, and provide a parent’s phone number or email address so that we can get their consent – from students under the age of 13 ("Children's Personal Information"). Use of the Service by students does not require sharing any additional Personal Information, and if you are a student under the age of 13, please do not send any other Personal Information about yourself to us. Parents, to obtain copies of all Children’s information we may have stored regarding your child under the age of 13, send an email to privacy@classdojo.com – before we can give you the information, we will need to verify your identity, such as by requiring that you send the request from the same email address you used to approve your child’s account. </p> <p>Teachers – using our Service does not require much if any personal information about students, and we prefer not to receive such information. </p></div> <div class="explanationNoTitle col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">If you’re under 13, we’ll ask you for your parent’s permission before you can sign up. We’ll also collect even less information from you if you’re under 13 – usually we'll just ask you for a random username and a password. Please don’t share any other personal information with us! </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p><strong>“Cookies” Information</strong>: When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. </p></div> <div class="explanationNoTitle col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">To remember you, our system will give you a “cookie”. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p><strong>“Automatically Collected” Information</strong>: When you use the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”) or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. </p></div> <div class="explanationNoTitle col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">Like most websites, our servers log technical information about service usage. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>The Limited Ways We Use Information</h3> <p>We use your Personally Identifiable Information in a variety of ways in the operation of the Service and our business, such as: </p> <p>We use the information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Service, and personalizing the Service for your and other users’ specific preferences. We will use your email address to contact you for administrative purposes, for customer service purposes, to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues, or any regarding content that you have posted to the Service. </p> <p>We use all of the information that you provide or that we collect and/or aggregate to understand and analyze the usage trends, interests, and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. </p> <p>Various aspects of the Service and email messages we send you in connection with your use of the Service, may include relevant advertisements which may be selected based in part on your Personally Identifiable Information, including your preferences and usage patterns within the Service. </p> <p>We use “automatically collected” information and “cookies” information to: (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, Apps accessed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. </p> <p>We may use your email address or other Personally Identifiable Information to send promotional email related to the Service we think you may be interested in. You will have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages, or by updating your account preferences through the Service. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">We use information we collect from you internally to improve how ClassDojo works for you. We’ll also send you more useful emails based on your profile settings. From time to time, we may send emails to everyone using ClassDojo. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>How Company Shares Information</h3> <p>We are not in the business of selling or leasing your information: <strong>WE DO NOT SELL, LEASE, OR SHARE YOUR (OR CHILDREN'S) PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ADVERTISING OR MARKETING PURPOSES! WE DO NOT SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS POLICY.</strong></p> <p>There are, however, a few limited ways that we share some of the information we collect with others that you should be aware of, as follows: </p> <p>The Service includes features that allow users to communicate in a variety of ways. Any Personally Identifiable Information that you voluntarily choose to share with another user through the Service, or in a publicly accessible area on the Service, such as by sharing User Submissions with another user, will be available to other users who access that content. Once you make your Personally Identifiable Information available in this way, we cannot control how the recipient uses that content. </p> <p>We work with third party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, and maintenance as well as other services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to us, these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. Generally, our policy is to make these disclosures under limitations comparable to those in this policy, although certain large service providers, such as large hosting providers, do not expressly agree to such limitations in their contracts with us or their other customers. Many third parties who we provide your Personally Identifiable Information authorize certain government and law enforcement agencies access to information stored by such third parties without providing notice to us, in some cases as required by law and in other cases voluntarily, and we have no control over such activities. </p> <p>We may make certain automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service. </p> <p>We may also disclose your information if required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena or where a parent requests copies of Children’s Personal Information, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), or in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with investigative or law enforcement activity. </p> <p>We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; to protect us and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Service; or to protect our, our users’, and others’ rights, property, and security. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">We do not sell or lease your personal information (or your children’s information) to anyone for any reason. We do, however, use trusted service providers (like our hosting company) to help provide the ClassDojo service, allow users to share certain information with each other when they want to, and share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information. We also may release other information to authorities when required by law or to prevent harm. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Your Choices</h3> <p>You may, of course, decline to share certain Personally Identifiable Information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Service. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences, or change sharing preferences for User Submissions at any time by accessing your account preferences page through the Service. Please note that your device will need to have a current and active network connection to make such changes, and while your changes may be reflected promptly in active User Submissions bases, users that have previously accessed the content may still have access to copies cached on their device, and we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. </p> <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">You can choose not to share information with us, but your experience of the service might be limited. </p> <p class="lead">Your account is protected by an encrypted password - you should make sure you keep it secret! </p> <p class="lead">You can update your account information and preferences or delete your account (or your child’s account) whenever you want, although there may be archived copies. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Third Party Services</h3> <p>The Service contains references and links to Web sites and services provided by third parties. Any Personally Identifiable Information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s policies governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with personally identifiable information. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">If you go to a third party service not owned or operated by ClassDojo, you should check their privacy policies, too. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</h3> <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we perform age neutral verification, and require verifiable parental consent before collecting Children’s Personal Information. We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information from persons under 13 years-of-age without verifiable parental consent. If we learns that Personally Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13 has been collected on the Service without verifiable parental consent, then we reserves the right to take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an account on the Service, then you may alert us at privacy@classdojo.com and request that we delete that child’s personal information from its systems. If you are a parent of a student user under 13, and would like to review the information we have collected about your child, please send a request to that effect to privacy@classdojo.com. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">We’re committed to children’s privacy. If a child under 13 signs up for a ClassDojo account, our signup flow requires parent permission to activate their account. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3> <p>It is important to understand that we are not an IT security services company. While we do employ certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to help improve the integrity and security of your personal information, no physical or technical system, process, transmission, or storage mechanism is completely secure or immune from outages, losses, attacks, circumvention, design or implementation flaws, and human error. We cannot warrant or ensure that information you transmit to us will not be lost or compromised, either during or after transmission. </p> <p>If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at privacy@classdojo.com. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">Despite all our best efforts, things can go wrong. We’ll let you know if that happens; if you learn of something that seems wrong, you should let us know by emailing privacy@classdojo.com. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>International Visitors</h3> <p>The Service is hosted in the United States and other jurisdictions, and is generally intended for users in the United States. If you nonetheless choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your Personally Identifiable Information outside of those regions to the United States or other jurisdictions for storage and processing, and by providing your Personally Identifiable Information on the Service you consent to that transfer, storage, and processing. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">We have servers in the US, so some of your data might be transferred here. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Affiliates; In the Event we are Acquired</h3> <p>Over time, our company may grow and reorganize to include other affiliated entities, such parent and subsidiary companies, and we may share your Personally Identifiable Information to any of these affiliated companies for use as described in this policy. In the event that all or a portion of the Company or its assets is acquired by or merged with a third party entity or is subject to a change of control, we may transfer the information that we have collected from users in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control to the acquiror or surviving entity. We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty days following the completion of such a transaction, and this policy will continue to apply to your information, unless you give consent to a new policy. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">If ClassDojo gets bought, your information will still be protected by these terms. We’ll let you know if this ever happens. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h3> <p>Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion, as provided in the Terms. If we modify the Privacy Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. Our amended Privacy Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Service, except that (i) we generally only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account ceasing use of the Service. Your continued use of the Service after revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">This privacy policy may change, and we’ll let you know if it does: we'll notify you, and give you a chance to opt out. </p></div></div> <hr><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Company Contact Information</h3> <p>Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, our third party disclosure practices, or your consent choices by email: privacy@classdojo.com. </p></div> <div class="explanation col-md-5 col-md-offset-1"><p>Basically, </p> <p class="lead">Questions?
