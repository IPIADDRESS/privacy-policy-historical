Clarifai has joined the Privacy Shield Framework governed by the Department of Commerce (via their website at </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.privacyshield.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and is committed to the principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability. When a participant’s privacy policy is available online, it must include a link to the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website and a link to the website or complaint submission form of the independent recourse mechanisms that is available to investigate individual complaints. Clarifai has selected the ICDR/AAA as its independent recourse mechanism: </span><a href="http://info.adr.org/safeharbor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://info.adr.org/safeharbor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.

Simply put, we collect data that is publicly available on the internet, from our website, our SDKs, our APIs and our partners or customers to train our algorithms to be faster, smarter and more accurate. You are free to explore our websites without providing any information about yourself. However, if you sign up for the API or any other service, then we will require collection of account creation data, such as your name, email address, password, location and employer and we may collect other personal data as described herein. In addition, if you visit our website and allow tracking mechanisms (such as cookies), we may also collect IP address, browser, geographic information, length of visit and pageviews, referral source, adID and the like. By using our services, you may also send us images or videos with personal data, such as a person’s face, of your users or that may contain other metadata that meets the criteria of personal data. </span></p>

Things like sending you email or figuring out the most popular models in our model gallery. We partner with other businesses to take care of that for us, such as Marketo or HubSpot. Sometimes that means sharing your data with them. However, we value the trust you place in us so we carefully screen our partners and ensure that they can only see personal data that is absolutely necessary for them to get the job done. If you no longer consent to sharing your data with our partners, please contact </span><a href="mailto:privacy@clarifai.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy@clarifai.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
