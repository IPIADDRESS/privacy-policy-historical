for certain information such as your username, first and last name, birthdate,
phone number and e-mail address when you register for a Clarifai account, or if
you correspond with us.&nbsp; We may also retain any messages you send through
the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post

to you the features and functionality of the Service.</span></font></p>

For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party
connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,”
“liking,” adding the Clarifai application, linking your account to the Clarifai
Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of
its service to Clarifai.&nbsp; This information could include, but is not
limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your
Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any
information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any
information you have made public in connection with that service.&nbsp; If you
allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your
connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience
more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well
as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Clarifai. You should
always review, and if necessary, adjust your account settings on third-party
websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Clarifai
Service.&nbsp; You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by
adjusting your settings on the third party service.&nbsp; If you unlink your
third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in
connection with that service.</span></font></p>

invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite
friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your
mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import
your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information
contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to
Clarifai through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text
or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact
list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply
to communications sent from you phone. Since this invitation is coming directly
from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this
communication. </span></font></p>

choose, you can locate your friends with Clarifai accounts through our “Find
friends” feature. The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate
friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as
Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on
Clarifai. If you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then
you agree to provide Clarifai access to your contact list such that we can
perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated
with the information you provide is using Clarifai. If you choose to find your
friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these
sites provide to us to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy
policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to find your
friends through a search of names or usernames then simply type a name to
search and see if that name or username appears on our Service.&nbsp; Note that
we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or
information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such
information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on
Clarifai.</span></font></p>

collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages

We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it
cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual User.</span></font></p>

When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small
text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your

in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.&nbsp; A cookie may also
convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you
view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow
us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A
persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your
browser.&nbsp; Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent
visits to the site.&nbsp; Persistent cookies can be removed by following your
web browser’s directions.&nbsp; A session cookie is temporary and disappears
after you close your browser.&nbsp; You can reset your web browser to refuse
all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; However, some
features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept
cookies is disabled.</span></font></p>

automatically record certain log file information.&nbsp; These server logs may
include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
(“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks
and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages,
pages viewed, and other such information.</span></font></p>

When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons)
which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our
Users.&nbsp; In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent
to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by
recipients.&nbsp; The information allows for more accurate reporting and
improvement of the Service.</span></font></p>

When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not
limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or
remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique
identifier (“UUID”).&nbsp; Device identifiers are small data files or similar
data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely
identify your mobile device.&nbsp; A device identifier may be data stored in
connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the
device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by
Clarifai.&nbsp; A device identifier may convey information to us about how you
browse and use the Service.&nbsp; A device identifier may remain persistently
on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through
the Service.&nbsp; Some features of the Service may not function properly if
use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. </span></font></p>

When you access the Service, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely
store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or
longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your device.&nbsp;
Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the
Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some features of the Service, particularly location-based
services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is
impaired or disabled.</span></font></p>
