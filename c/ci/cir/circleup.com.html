            </li>
            <li>

                    address, and other information you make publicly available via the applicable social networking site) from
                    the account you have with such social networking site and use that information to create your Account. The

                <ul><li><strong>Internet Log Files</strong></li></ul>
                <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
                    information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
                    referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. CircleUp may store such
                    information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by CircleUp
                    affiliates, agents, or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other
                    information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each
                    page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and
                    interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the

                    Personal Data and other information provided to CircleUp by Issuers and Users.</p>

                <p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate and non-aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this
                    data, including Personal Data, with its affiliates, agents and business partners. CircleUp may also disclose
                    such user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to

                <ul><li><strong>Cookies</strong></li></ul>
                <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information
                    that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help
                    provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance,
                    our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and
                    then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. We may use cookies to collect your Personal
                    Data. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for
                    information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
                    We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's
                    features.</p>

                <p>The use of cookies by our any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We
                    do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners may use session ID cookies to make it easier
                    for you to navigate our site and use our Services.</p>

                <ul><li><strong>Clear GIFs and Tracking Pixels</strong></li></ul>

                <p>Clear GIFs (including web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based
                    document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are small (only 1-by-1
                    pixel) and usually the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We use clear
                    GIFs to collect your Personal Data. Furthermore, we use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information
                    for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to
                    personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.</p>

                <p>We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by, for
                    example, excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new
                    installation.</p>

                <ul><li><strong>Analytic Metric Tools and Other Technology</strong></li></ul>

                    other device identifiers, browser types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any),

                    activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of

                <ul><li><strong>This Site Uses Google Analytics and AdWords</strong></li></ul>

                <p>This Site uses Google Analytics to track viewing trends and help analyze how visitors use the CircleUp Site.
                    This information helps us to improve the CircleUp Site and the overall user experience. Google Analytics
                    uses cookies to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information. This Site also
                    uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise CircleUp and CircleUp Issuers on third party

                <ul><li><strong>Ad Serving Technology</strong></li></ul>

                <p>CircleUp’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary or third party ad serving
                    technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect
                    information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track results. We
                    or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender
                    as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is
                    presented within the site, online or mobile product or service and to calculate or control the number of
                    unique and repeat views of a given ad, and/or deliver ads that may relate to your interests and measure the
                    effectiveness of ad campaigns. We or third parties may collect data for this purpose including IP address

                    of the company providing the ad serving technology.</p>

                <p>The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information collected or obtained from
                    CircleUp with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or
                    mobile products and services relating to your web browser’s activities across their network of websites.
                    Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>

                <p>CircleUp uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you
                    provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for
                    which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide
                    to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain
                    access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to
                    monitor your use of such services. Please note, however, that the information you provide to us about
                    yourself when you create an account to use certain Services on the site, including your name and e-mail
                    address, will be publicly available and searchable via search engines by default. If you wish to keep your
                    profile accessible only to CircleUp users or hide selected sections of your public profile, you can do so at
                    any time by changing the public profile settings on your ‘account settings’ page. In addition, we may
                    provide information regarding your site activity to third parties and affiliates. We also may obtain
                    information about you from third party sources to verify your identity so we can properly process your
                    requests and prevent fraud. By accessing our Site and using our Services, you hereby explicitly consent that
                    we may use your submitted and obtained Personal Information for such purposes.</p>

                <p>CircleUp and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and
                    other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and
                    functionality of the Site, to enforce our Terms of Service, to better understand our users, to detect,
                    investigate and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal, to personalize control and
                    experiences on our sites and applications, and to improve the Services. CircleUp and its Related Companies
                    may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we
                    believe will be of interest to you. If at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing
                    communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated
                    below. Note however that as a User of the Service we will send you administrative communications that are
                    reasonably necessary to the Service. If CircleUp intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is
                    not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the
                    time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

                <p>If you choose to use our service to refer a friend to a CircleUp product or site, we may ask you for your
                    friend’s name and email address. In such cases, we will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting
                    him or her to visit the site or check out our products. CircleUp retains your friend’s name and email for a
                    short period for the sole purpose of sending this email. We do not keep or use this information for any
                    other purpose. </p>

                <h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>

                <p>We will share personal and other information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this
                    Privacy Policy. There may also be circumstances where you may share information on your own. Other than the
                    information provided when you create an account to access Services (as described in Section 5), you may
                    opt-out if you don’t want CircleUp to share your personal information with third parties and affiliates. To
                    opt out of further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with your information has been shared,
                    please contact that partner or sponsor directly.</p>

                <p>From time to time, CircleUp employs third party contractors to collect Personal Data on our behalf to provide
                    email delivery, products, promotional fulfillment, shipping or other services on our sites. When requesting
                    these services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to
                    our contractors. We ask some third party contractors, such as data analytics or market research firms, to
                    supplement personal information that you provide to us for our own marketing and demographic studies, so
                    that we can consistently improve our sites and related advertising to better meet our visitors’ needs and
                    preferences. To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the Personal
                    Data you provide to us.</p>

                <p>When our third party agents or service providers collect and/or have access to any information other than
                    non-personal, anonymous and/or aggregated data, CircleUp does not require that they use data consistently
                    with our stated Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>You will be notified before your Personal Data is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service
                    provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that
                    party.</p>

                <p>We may also access and disclose personal information, including personal communications, in connection with
                    report abuse functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to
                    comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to
                    believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our
                    rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we
                    believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial
                    proceeding, court order, or legal process served on CircleUp. Note that certain publicly available
                    information you post and communicate on our and third party sites and services is public information for
                    which you have no expectation of privacy. </p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by CircleUp other than Personal Data
                    collected through the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information
                    you provide to CircleUp through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to,

                <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

                <p>CircleUp does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under
                    the age of thirteen, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal

                <h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

                <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or
                    controlled by CircleUp (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply
                    to the Third Party Sites. The fact that we link to a Website is not an endorsement, authorization or
                    representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site,
                    including on an advertisement, you will leave the CircleUp site you are visiting and go to the site you
                    selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any
                    use of your Personal Data by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same
                    privacy and security practices as CircleUp. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other
                    service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party Website that is linked to a
                    CircleUp site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Data.</p>

                    the third party partners at the point of registration. If you elect to register for such products and/or
