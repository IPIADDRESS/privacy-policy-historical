                    your use of the Service (an “Account”). You may create an Account directly via the Site or by

                    networking site and use that information to create your Account. The information we obtain may
                    depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking site. We also collect other

                    and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better
                    understand and serve the users of the Services, CircleUp often conducts research on its customer

                    CircleUp by Issuers and Users.</p>

                <p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this
                    non-personal and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of
                    non-personal and aggregate information does not identify you personally. CircleUp may also disclose

                    partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

                    small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and usually the same color as the background of the web page, document or
                    email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Data about you. We may, however, use
                    clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on
                    a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for
                    statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.</p>

                <p>We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by,
                    for example, excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source
                    of a new installation.</p>

                <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
                    businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or
                    similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets and you will be notified via
                    email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
                    information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

                <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong>CircleUp, like many
                    businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples
                    of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, ID verification, processing
                    applications, shipping and fulfillment, and processing payments and completing transactions. When we
                    employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the
                    information that they need to perform their specific function. These companies are authorized to use
                    your personal information&nbsp;only as necessary to provide&nbsp;these services to us.</p>


                <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong>CircleUp may disclose your Personal Data if required to
                    do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
                    obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of CircleUp, (iii) act in urgent
                    circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public against fraud or
                    other harm, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

                <p>CircleUp does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen. If you are

                <h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

                <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not
                    operated or controlled by CircleUp (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we
                    described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The fact that we link to a Website is not an
                    endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click
                    on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the CircleUp site you
                    are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third
                    parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Data by such third parties,
                    and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as
                    CircleUp. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom
                    you request services. If you visit a third party Website that is linked to a CircleUp site, you
                    should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Data. </p>

                <p>Members may register for other services from our site(s). Certain products and/or services available
                    on our site are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you to disclose

                    party(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not
                    responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should
                    review the privacy practices and policies of such third party(s) prior to providing your Personal
                    Data in connection with such products and/or services. </p>
