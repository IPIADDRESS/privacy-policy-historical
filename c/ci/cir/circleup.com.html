                with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such
                Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of

            <p><strong>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</strong> When you interact with CircleUp through the Site or Services,
                we receive and store certain non-identifiable information about you. Such information, which may be
                collected passively using various technologies or through other means, cannot be used to specifically identify you. </p>

            <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
                This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider
                (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. CircleUp may
                store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained
                by CircleUp affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it
                with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number
                of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers,
                and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand

                type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. CircleUp
                may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and
                prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

            <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of

                Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site
                usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you
                to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a
                visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data
                except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the
                toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you
                are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies
                turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p>

            <p>The use of cookies by our any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our
                privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID
                cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our Services.</p>

            <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>

            <p>CircleUp uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
                Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in

                if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your

                that as user of the Service we will send you administrative communications that are reasonably
                necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. , If CircleUp intends on

                be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is
                collected.</p>

            <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> CircleUp, like many businesses, sometimes

            include mailing information, maintaining databases, ID verification, processing applications,
            shipping and fulfillment, and processing payments and completing transactions. When we employ
            another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that
            they need to perform their specific function. These companies are authorized to use your personal
            information <em>only as necessary to provide </em>these services to us.</p>

                settings page, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@circleup.com">info@circleup.com</a>

                services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
                information (such as bank account information) on our website, we encrypt the transmission of
                that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use third party ID
                verification to ensure our users’ true identities are validated.</p>

            <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
                during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
                method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
                absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us
                at <a href="mailto:info@circleup.com">info@circleup.com</a></p>

				By accessing this site and any pages thereof, you agree to be bound by its <a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a> and

                CircleUp.com is intended for accredited investors only.
                Company listings on this Site are only suitable for accredited investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private investments.
                Securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded and are intended for investors who do not have a need for a liquid investment.
                There can be no assurance the valuation is accurate or in agreement with the market or industry valuations.
                Additionally, investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements.
                Companies seeking private placement investments tend to be in earlier stages of development and have not yet been fully tested in the public marketplace.
                Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments.
                Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
