     the footer is also used by the Zinnia blog (/blog), which relies on *Django* template
     syntax, not Jinja template syntax, and grouping booleans like that is not supported.
     Anything in base.html or its partials must work
     with both syntaxes so long as we use it as the base for Zinnia blog entries as well. -->

CircleUp.com is intended for accredited investors only.
CircleUp does not make investment recommendations.
No communication, through this website or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation for

Company listings on this Site are only suitable for accredited investors who are familiar with and
willing to accept the high risk associated with private investments. Securities sold through
private placements are not publicly traded and are intended for investors who do not have a
need for a liquid investment.
There can be no assurance the valuation is accurate or in agreement with the market or industry valuations.
Additionally, investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements.
Companies seeking private placement investments tend to be in earlier stages of development and have not
yet been fully tested in the public marketplace.
Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance,
low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments.
Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
