We also may receive information from third parties in connection with marketing and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement Personal Data provided directly by you.</p><p>When anonymous information is directly associated with Personal Data, such that the anonymous information can be associated with an individual User, this anonymous information is treated as Personal Data.</p></section>
<section data-field="section_name"><h3>4. How We Collect Information</h3></section><section data-field="section_content"><p>We collect information you provide to us when you request products, services or information from us, interact on our sites and applications, respond to surveys, or otherwise interact with us.</p><p>In order to access additional functionality of the Site, you may be required to create an account for your use of the Service (an “Account”). You may create an Account directly via the Site or by logging into your Account with certain third party social networking sites (such as Facebook and LinkedIn) via our Service. If you decide to create an Account by logging into a social networking site via our Service, we will obtain the Personal Data you have provided to the social networking site (such as your name, profile picture, email address, and other information you make publicly available via the applicable social networking site) from the social networking account and use that information to create your Account with us. The information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking site. We also collect other information that you provide as part of Account registration and your use of the Service.</p><h4>Internet Log Files</h4><p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data. CircleUp may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by CircleUp affiliates, agents, or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' ISPs, and how our Users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve our Users, CircleUp often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on Personal Data and other information provided to CircleUp by Users.</p><p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate and non-aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this data, including Personal Data, with its affiliates, agents and business partners for any lawful purpose. CircleUp may also disclose such User statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for lawful purposes.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>In operating this Site, we also may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us to analyze Site usage more accurately. We may use cookies to collect your Personal Data. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p><p>The use of cookies by our any of our service providers is not covered by this Privacy Policy, except to the extent that the cookies are delivered to you through our Site. We do not have access or control over cookies delivered to you by third-party websites. Our partners may use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and use our Services.</p><h4>Clear GIFs and Tracking Pixels</h4><p>Clear GIFs (including web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and usually the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We use clear GIFs to collect your Personal Data. Furthermore, we use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a User to personalize User experience and for statistical analysis of User experiences on our web pages.</p><p>We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by, for example, excluding our current Users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.</p><h4>Analytic Metric Tools and Other Technology</h4><p>CircleUp uses third party analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online Services. These tools and technologies use server log files, web beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, other internet and website usage information, and the date and time of activity on our websites.</p><p>The third party analytics companies who collect information on our Site and in the context of our Services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p><h4>Google Analytics and AdWords</h4><p>This Site uses Google Analytics to track viewing trends and help analyze how visitors use the CircleUp Site. This information helps us to improve the Site and the overall User experience. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect standard internet log information and User behavior information. This Site also uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise CircleUp and CircleUp Issuers on third party websites to previous visitors to the CircleUp Site. Google AdWords remarketing will display relevant ads tailored to you by using a cookie that helps track what parts of the Site you have viewed. Google AdWords remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing efforts to better suit your needs and display ads that are most relevant to your interests. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page.</p><h4>Ad Serving Technology</h4><p>CircleUp’s websites, online or mobile products or services may employ proprietary or third party ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels or other technologies to collect information as a result of ad serving through our products or services as well as to help track results. We or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use information such as age and gender, as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented to you and to calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, and/or to deliver ads that may relate to your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. We or third parties may collect data for this purpose including IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), device IDs, information about your software, applications and hardware, browser information (and/or information passed via your browser), hardware, machine or device make and model, advertisement(s) served, length of time an advertisement was visible, other Internet and website usage information, web pages and mobile internet sites which have been viewed by you (as well as date and time), domain type, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), and angle of view. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed per this Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.</p><p>The advertising companies who deliver ads for us may combine the information collected or obtained from CircleUp with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your web browser’s activities across their network of websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p><p>For more information about the practices of other ad serving companies that may collect information based on your interaction with ads on this site, in our mobile products, and other sites or products not owned/managed by CircleUp, or to “opt out” of targeted advertising delivered by National Advertising Initiative (NAI) member ad networks, you should visit www.networkadvertising.org.</p><p>Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your device. Note that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents CircleUp or its analytics providers from tracking your browser's activities in relation to the Service. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at privacy@circleup.com. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our Users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser or device at this time.</p><h4>Other Information Collected From Third Parties</h4><p>CircleUp may also receive other information from third parties, including in connection with the operation of our products and services as well as marketing and demographic studies that we use to supplement Personal Data and anonymous information provided directly by you. Some third party services such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn may also provide us with information from your accounts there with your permission.</p><p>CircleUp may also collect or receive information about you from other CircleUp users who choose to upload their email and other contacts. This information will be stored by us and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.</p></section>

To enrich our understanding of individual customers, we tie this information to the Personal Data you provide to us.</p><p>We may also access and disclose Personal Data, including personal communications, in connection with abuse reporting functions in our products and services, to enforce legal rights and comply with the law, or to comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, or when we have reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on CircleUp. Note that certain publicly available information you post and communicate on third party sites and services is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.</p><p>We share your Personal Data only when applicable law allows us to do so without obtaining your prior consent. Federal law only gives you the right to limit: (i) sharing Personal Data about your creditworthiness with a Related Company for the Related Company’s everyday business purposes; (ii) the ability of a Related Company to use your Personal Data to market to you; (iii) sharing for non-affiliates to market to you. State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.</p><p>We will not share your Personal Data with a non-affiliate for its independent marketing purposes without your consent. We also will not share your Personal Information with joint marketing partners except to the extent that applicable law permits us to do so without your prior consent. Please see below for additional information about our Related Companies.</p><h4>Testimonials</h4><p>We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Site, in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name and other information. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@circleup.com">privacy@circleup.com</a>.</p><h4>Public Information Including User Generated Content, Forums, Blogs, and Third Party Sites</h4><p>Our Site may offer a publicly accessible blog. You should be aware that any information you provide in this area may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Data from our blog, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@circleup.com">privacy@circleup.com</a>. In some cases, however, we may not be able to remove your Personal Data.</p><p>You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing content to CircleUp or in our online forums, blogs, message boards for public view or in similar forums on our sites and/or on third party sites. Information that you disclose is unencrypted, public information that may be accessed or recorded by CircleUp employees or others, and you should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality with respect to such information.</p><p>You should be aware that any Personal Data you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, or collected, or used by other Users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Data you choose to make public in any of these forums on third party sites.</p><p>Unsolicited information that you provide to CircleUp through this Site or through any other means, including (but not limited to) information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”) shall be deemed to be non-confidential. CircleUp shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p><p>Note also that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. CircleUp has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.</p><p>If you post a video, image, or photo on one of our Sites for public view, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other Users without your consent. We are not responsible for the videos, images, or photos that you choose to submit to any CircleUp sites.</p><p>There are also certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p><p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p><p><strong>Related Companies:</strong> We also may share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy, but only to the extent that applicable law permits us to do so without your prior consent. Related Companies are affiliated by common ownership or control. They can be financial or non-financial companies. Our Related Companies include companies with a CircleUp name and other financial companies, such as Fundme Securities, LLC, CircleUp Credit Advisors LLC, and CU Advisors, LLC.</p><p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> CircleUp, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, identity verification, processing applications, shipping and fulfillment, and processing payments and completing transactions. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. These companies are authorized to use your Personal Data only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p><p><strong>Joint Marketing:</strong> Joint marketing is a formal agreement between non-affiliated financial companies that together market financial products or services to you. CircleUp does not jointly market.</p><p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> CircleUp may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of CircleUp, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or the public against fraud or other harm, or (iv) protect against fraud or legal liability.</p></section>
