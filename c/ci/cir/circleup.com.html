    <h3>At CircleUp we recognize that
	your privacy is extremely important, and protecting your privacy and
	personal information is cornerstone of our business. 

	This policy covers how CircleUp treats personal information
	that CircleUp collects and receives, including information related to
	your past use of CircleUp products and services. Personal information
	is information about you that is personally identifiable like your
	name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not
	otherwise publicly available. </h3>
<h3>Your Guarantee of Privacy</h3>
<p>At CircleUp, we don't believe in SPAM.
	Period.  
	<i>We won't rent, sell or barter or lease your email or instant
		messenger address or your contacts' emails addresses or IM accounts
		to third parties.</i> That is your information, and even though we store
	it, we will never give it away or share it. In addition, we will only
	send you CircleUp emails directly related to your account or the
	CircleUp service. CircleUp does not rent email lists (ever), nor will
	we share your name with "marketing partners" unless you specifically
	authorize it by proactively opting-in to a mailing list. </p>
<h3>Privacy of Questions</h3>
<p>The CircleUp service enables questions
	to have different levels of privacy. These privacy choices are
	selected by the question Author and determine how and to whom your
	responses are displayed. Your contact information (email, IM, SMS) is
	NEVER displayed in full, but to attach some identity to your answer
	we use your address prefix. Questions can have the following privacy
	status: 
	</p><ul>
		<li><b>Public:</b> Anyone will be able to view the results of the
		question, including search engines. The question and results are
		posted publicly for search and can be accessed by anyone with the
		link to the results page.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Private Summary:</b> Only recipients of the question (the circle)
		and those they forward the question to will be able to view the
		summary results (in aggregate), but not individual responses or
		comments. Only the Author can review individual answers and
		comments.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Private Detailed:</b> Only recipients of the question and those
		they forward to will be able to view the complete results. The
		entire circle can review individual answers and comments.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Personal: </b>Only the author can view the results of the
		question, both summary and detail.
	</li></ul><p></p>
<h3>Your Contacts' Personal Information</h3>
<p>The CircleUp service sends
	communications on your behalf to people you know. We understand that
	these people trust you with their contact information, and we
	maintain it with the same confidentiality as you do. </p>
<p>Your contacts' email addresses and
	instant messenger (IM) accounts are held in the same strict
	confidence that your own contact information is held. We will never
	contact any of your contacts directly unless you make a specific
	request. We will never rent, lease, sell or barter this information
	to any third party. We will only use your contacts' email or IM
	address in order to send the message you asked us to send. Your
	contacts will never ever hear from us again ... unless they
	voluntarily subscribe to our services! </p>
