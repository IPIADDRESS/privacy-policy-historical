                        with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such
                        Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of
                        CircleUp and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</b>

                    <b>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</b> When you interact with CircleUp through the Site or
                    Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information,
                    which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically
                    identify you. <p></p>

                    <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
                        files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
                        service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream
                        data. CircleUp may store such information itself or such information may be included in

                        number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain
                        names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the
                        Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services,

                        the Personal Data and other information provided to us. </p>

                    <p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this
                        non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this
                        type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. CircleUp
                        may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and
                        prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

                    <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of
                        information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the
                        Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site
                        usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you
                        to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a
                        visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data
                        except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the
                        toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you
                        are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies
                        turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p>

                    <p>The use of cookies by our any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our
                        privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID
                        cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our Services.</p>

                    <h3>Security</h3>

                    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
                        information (such as bank account information) on our website, we encrypt the transmission of
                        that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use third party ID
                        verification to ensure our users’ true identities are validated.</p>

                    <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
                        during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
                        method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
                        absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us
                        at info@circleup.com</p>

                        shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information
                        without limitation or attribution.</p>

                        so and why.</p>

                        properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted
                        directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy
                        of the company providing it. </p>

                        their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
                        Personal Data to CircleUp through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete
                        that information from our databases.</p>
