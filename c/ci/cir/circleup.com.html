                 Adroll event tracking can't handle events that happen before the javascript tracking
                 file is fully loaded. This makes it so we can track events before the file is loaded.

                 Adroll documentation would have you call the segmentation code this way:

                 try { __adroll.record_user({"adroll_segments": "segment_name"}) } catch(err) {}

                 To make the same call using the new interface you would make the following call.

                 _cuAdroll.push(['record_user', {"adroll_segments": "segment_name"}]);

                <small>Updated February 27th, 2015</small>
            </h1>

            <h3>Summary of Major Changes</h3>

            <p>We clarified that Personal Data is information that identifies you and that can be used alone to contact
                you online or offline. Personal Data may be supplemented or tied with other information, including
                non-personal or anonymous information and information that we receive from third parties.</p>

            <p>Non-personal information is information that alone cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as
                your demographic information and information about your computer. We may use and share non-personal
                information for purposes such as improving our products and services and providing services to you.</p>

            <p>We may receive information from third parties that we use to supplement Personal Data and non-personal
                information. Such information from third parties includes demographic information, information provided
                by social networking sites, and information about you from other CircleUp users (e.g., contact
                information).</p>

            <p>You may be required to create an account to use certain services on the Site. If you create a CircleUp
                account using, or to connect to CircleUp through, a social networking site, that site may share certain
                Personal Data and non-personal information with us that we may use to create the account and for other
                purposes described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We use various technologies on the Site to provide Services, offer you ads, and for other purposes. Such
                technologies include clear GIFs, tracking pixels, cookies, web beacons, and certain third party
                analytics and ad serving technologies. The third party analytics and advertising companies we use may
                also collect information from the Site using these technologies and combine it with other information
                they have, such as information they have collected from other websites, and use and share it in
                accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

            <p>We may use and share your Personal Data and non-personal information to improve the Site, personalize the
                Site, enforce our Terms of Service, investigate activities that violate our policies, and comply with
                law, among other uses. We may also share your Personal Data and non-personal information with our third
                party contractors, including contractors who provide email delivery, products, advertising, analytics
                and other services. You will be notified before your Personal Data is collected by any third party that
                is not our agent or contractor.</p>

            <p>The Site offers certain forums that are publicly accessible, such as blogs and message boards. Please be
                aware that any information you provide in these forums (including Personal Data) may be read, collected,
                and used by others who access them, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not
                responsible for the information you choose to make public in any of these forums. You may request
                removal of your personal information from our blog, but we may be unable to do so in some cases.</p>

            <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
                Services, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

            <p>You may opt out of targeted advertising delivered by the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) member ad
                networks by visiting <a href="www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>

            <p>You may opt-in to allow CircleUp to share your Personal Data with companies and organizations that
                provide products or services that may be of interest to you. To opt out of further communications from
                these partners after your information has been shared, please contact that partner directly.</p>

                    <h3>Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>

                    <p>At CircleUp, our most important asset is our relationship with you. We are required by law to ask
                        for certain information in order to perform our services for you, but we are committed to
                        protecting your personal and financial information. This Privacy Policy describes the treatment
                        of information provided on the sites where this Privacy Policy is posted. It also describes the
                        treatment of information provided by you on applications that we make available on third-party
                        sites or platforms if disclosed to you in connection with the use of such applications. This
                        Privacy Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your information
                        and how you can access and update this information. </p>

                    <p>Welcome to the web site&nbsp;<a href="www.circleup.com">www.circleup.com</a>&nbsp;(the "Site")
                        owned and operated by CircleUp Network,
                        Inc. (Henceforward "CircleUp," "we," "us," and/or "our"). This Site has been created to provide
                        information about our company and its financial matchmaking services (the "Services") to all

                        provided by CircleUp (in each case, a "User"). This Privacy Policy sets forth CircleUp's policy
                        with respect to information, including personally identifiable information ("Personal Data"),
                        and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Services. <em>If you
                            have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at

                    <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY CIRCLEUP SITE OR SERVICE. If we
                        change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the CircleUp
                        homepage, or other locations so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it,
                        and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this
                        Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material or significant
                        changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our
                        homepage prior to the changes taking effect. Your continued use of our products and services
                        will signify your acceptance of the changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>

                    <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong>&nbsp; Personal Data is information
                        that identifies you and that can be used alone to contact you online or offline.  We collect
                        Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information to us such as when you
                        register for access to the Services (for example, contact information such as your name, email
                        address, and mailing address)  when you wish to use certain Services (for example financial
                        information such as bank account numbers, your date of birth and the last four digits of you
                        social security number), when you contact us with inquiries or respond to our marketing surveys
                        and email campaigns, when you link to your profile on a third-party site or platform with your
                        Account, and otherwise when you use our services where Personal Data is required for use and/or
                        participation.  When anonymous information is directly associated with Personal Data, this
                        anonymous information is also treated as Personal Data.</p>

                    <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in
                        accordance with this Privacy Policy and you agree that you will abide by our Terms of Service.
                        If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
                        transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of CircleUp and the authorized
                        third parties referred to herein located in the United States of America.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Non-Personal, Anonymous, or Aggregated Data:</strong>Non-personal information, alone,
                        cannot be used to identify or contact you. When you interact with CircleUp through the Site or
                        Services, we receive and store certain non-personal information about you for purposes that include
                        improving our products and services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating
                        the provision of updates, dynamically served content and product support, and communicating with
                        you. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other
                        means, may include demographic information including gender, age, zip code, information about your
                        computer, hardware, software, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device
                        identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC)
                        address and connection. We may also receive information from third parties in connection with
                        marketing and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement personal information
                        provided directly by you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How We Collect Information</h3>

                    <p>We collect information you provide to us when you request products, services or information
                        from us, register with us, participate in forums or other activities in our sites and
                        applications, respond to surveys or otherwise interact with us. </p>

                    <p>In order to access additional functionality of the Site, you may be required to create an account
                        for your use of the Service (an “Account”). You may create an Account directly via the Site or
                        by logging into your Account with certain third party social networking sites (including
                        Facebook and LinkedIn) via our Service. If you decide to create an Account by logging into a
                        social networking site via our Service, we will obtain the Personal Data you have provided to
                        the social networking site (such as your name, profile picture, email address, and other
                        information you make publicly available via the applicable social networking site) from the
                        account you have with such social networking site and use that information to create your
                        Account. The information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social
                        networking site. We also collect other information that you provide as part of account
                        registration and your use of the Service.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Internet Log Files</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
                        files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
                        service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream
                        data. CircleUp may store such information itself or such information may be included in
                        databases owned and maintained by CircleUp affiliates, agents, or service providers. This Site
                        may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total
                        number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain
                        names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the
                        Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services,
                        CircleUp often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on
                        Personal Data and other information provided to CircleUp by Issuers and Users.</p>

                    <p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this
                        non-personal and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type
                        of non-personal and aggregate information does not identify you personally. CircleUp may also
                        disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective
                        business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cookies</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of
                        information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the
                        Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site
                        usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you
                        to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a
                        visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data
                        except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the
                        toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you
                        are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies
                        turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p>

                    <p>The use of cookies by our any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our
                        privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners may use
                        session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our Services.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear GIFs and Tracking Pixels</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Clear GIFs (including web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page,
                        web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they
                        are small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and usually the same color as the background of the web page,
                        document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Data about you. We may,
                        however, use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or
                        other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user
                        experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.</p>

                    <p>We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently
                        by, for example, excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying
                        the source of a new installation.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Analytic Metric Tools and Other Technology</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>CircleUp uses third party analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online
                        services. These tools and technologies use server log files, web beacons, cookies, tracking
                        pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information, including
                        cookies, IP addresses (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic
                        location), mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser types,
                        browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), referring and exit pages, and
                        URLs, platform type, click information, information about your media, peripheral hardware,
                        software and/or applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and types,
                        landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising conversion rates, the date
                        and amount of time spent on particular pages, other internet and website usage information, and

                    <p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are important to us.We use
                        commercially reasonable efforts to follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal
                        information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter
                        sensitive information (such as bank account information) on our website, we encrypt the
                        transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use third
                        party ID verification to ensure our users’ true identities are validated. From time to time, we
                        review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be
                        aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
                        storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be
                        accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or
                        managerial safeguards. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to
                        our servers and systems. We will retain your information for as long as your Account is active
                        or as needed to provide you services unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
                        by law. If you wish to cancel your Account or request that we no longer user your information
                        please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@circleup.com">info@circleup.com</a>. If you have any

                        This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, such
                        as bulletin boards or forums (collectively, "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or

                        "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential
                        and CircleUp shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited

                    <p>CircleUp does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen. If you
                        are under the age of thirteen, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We
                        encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help

                        Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of
                        thirteen has provided Personal Data to CircleUp through this Site, please contact us, and we
                        will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

                    <h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not
                        operated or controlled by CircleUp (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we
                        described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The fact that we link to a Website is not
                        an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you
                        click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave the
                        CircleUp site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the
                        activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Data
                        by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and
                        security practices as CircleUp. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other
                        service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party Website that is
                        linked to a CircleUp site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any
                        Personal Data.</p>

                    <p>Members may register for other services from our site(s). Certain products and/or services
                        available on our site are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you
                        to disclose Personal Data in order to register for and access such products and/or services.
                        Such products and/or services shall identify the third party partners at the point of
                        registration. If you elect to register for such products and/or services your Personal Data will
                        be transferred to such third party(s) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of
                        such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies of such third
                        party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third
                        party(s) prior to providing your Personal Data in connection with such products and/or
                        services.</p>

                        account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We
