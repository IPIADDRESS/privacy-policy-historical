                    (Henceforward "CircleUp," "we," "us," and/or "our"). This Site has been created to provide information about
                    our company and its financial matchmaking services (the "Services") to all users of the Site or Service,

                <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>

                <p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other
                    non-personal information from you, as further described below.</p>

                <p><b>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</b> Personal Data is information that identifies you and that can be used alone to contact you online or offline.  We collect Personal Data from you when you provide such information to us such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address)  when you wish to use certain Services (for example financial information such as bank account numbers, your date of birth and the last four digits of you social security number), when you contact us with inquiries or respond to our marketing surveys and email campaigns, when you link to your profile on a third-party site or platform with your Account, and otherwise when you use our services where Personal Data is required for use and/or participation.  When anonymous information is directly associated with Personal Data, this anonymous information is also treated as Personal Data.</p>

                <p><b>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and you agree that you will abide by our Terms of Service. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of CircleUp and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States of America.</b></p>

                <p><b>Non-Personal, Anonymous, or Aggregated Data:</b>&nbsp; Non-personal information, alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you.  When you interact with CircleUp through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain non-personal information about you for purposes that include improving our products and services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the provision of updates, dynamically served content and product support, and communicating with you. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other means, may include demographic information including gender, age, zip code, information about your computer, hardware, software, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection.  We may also receive information from third parties in connection with marketing and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How We Collect Information</h3>

                <p>We collect information you provide to us when you request products, services or information from us, register
                    with us, participate in forums or other activities in our sites and applications, respond to surveys or
                    otherwise interact with us. </p>

                <p>In order to access additional functionality of the Site, you may be required to create an account for your
                    use of the Service (an <strong><em>“Account”</em></strong>). You may create an Account directly via the Site or by logging into your
                    Account with certain third party social networking sites (including Facebook and LinkedIn) via our Service.
                    If you decide to create an Account by logging into a social networking site via our Service, we will obtain
                    the Personal Data you have provided to the social networking site (such as your name, profile picture, email
                    address, and other information you make publicly available via the applicable social networking site) from
                    the account you have with such social networking site and use that information to create your Account. The
                    information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking site. We also
                    collect other information that you provide as part of account registration and your use of the Service.</p>

                <ul><li><strong>Internet Log Files</strong></li></ul>
                <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
                    information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
                    referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. CircleUp may store such
                    information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by CircleUp
                    affiliates, agents, or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other
                    information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each
                    page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and
                    interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
                    Services, CircleUp often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on
                    Personal Data and other information provided to CircleUp by Issuers and Users.</p>

                <p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate and non-aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this
                    data, including Personal Data, with its affiliates, agents and business partners. CircleUp may also disclose
                    such user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to
                    other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

                <ul><li><strong>Cookies</strong></li></ul>
                <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information
                    that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help

                <p>CircleUp does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under
                    the age of thirteen, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal

                <h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

                <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or

                    to the Third Party Sites. The fact that we link to a Website is not an endorsement, authorization or
                    representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site,
                    including on an advertisement, you will leave the CircleUp site you are visiting and go to the site you
                    selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any
                    use of your Personal Data by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same
                    privacy and security practices as CircleUp. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other
                    service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party Website that is linked to a
                    CircleUp site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Data.</p>

                <p>Members may register for other services from our site(s). Certain products and/or services available on our
                    site are provided to you in partnership with third party(s) and may require you to disclose Personal Data in
                    order to register for and access such products and/or services. Such products and/or services shall identify
                    the third party partners at the point of registration. If you elect to register for such products and/or
                    services your Personal Data will be transferred to such third party(s) and will be subject to the privacy
                    policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy practices and policies
                    of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy practices and policies of such third
                    party(s) prior to providing your Personal Data in connection with such products and/or services. </p>

CircleUp does not make investment recommendations.
No communication, through this website or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation for

There can be no assurance the valuation is accurate or in agreement with the market or industry valuations.
Additionally, investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements.
Companies seeking private placement investments tend to be in earlier stages of development and have not

Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance,
low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments.
Investors must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.</p>
