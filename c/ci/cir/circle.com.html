      <div>Before permitting you to use Circle Services, we may require you to provide additional information we can use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your date of birth, partial social security numbers or other information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification services.<br><br>When you use Circle Services, we collect information about your transactions and your other activities on our website and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.<br><br>You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter).

      <h3>How we protect and store personal information</h3>
      <div>Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.

We also authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. All of our physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</div>
      <h3>How we use the personal information we collect</h3>
      <div>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, efficient, and customized experience and we strive to limit the amount of personal information we need to collect, use or disclose. We may use your personal information to:</div>

      <ul>
        <li>Service providers under contract who assist with our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services.

        <li>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)</li>
        <li>
          Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:
