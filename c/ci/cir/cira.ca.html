<p>As part of the administration of the <a id="Def" title="The Internet country code top-level domain for Canada.">.ca</a> <a id="Def" title="Means the .ca Internet Domain Name registry operated by CIRA.">Registry</a>, CIRA operates an electronic look-up service called "WHOIS". WHOIS is designed to provide limited information concerning <a id="Def" title="Means a .ca domain name or sub-domain name.">Domain Names</a>.</p>
<p>WHOIS has built-in privacy protection options, which can be used to limit the personal information available through the WHOIS system.  For <a id="Def" title="Means a Person who is listed in the Registry as the Registrant of a Domain Name.">Registrants</a> who are individuals (e.g. as opposed to organizations), the privacy protection options are turned on by default, and only limited personal information is available to third parties when they search the WHOIS system for a <a id="Def" title="Means a .ca domain name or sub-domain name.">Domain Name</a> that you have registered.  If you turn your privacy protection option off, more of your personal information will be available through the WHOIS system.  Your privacy protections can be changed by contacting your Registrar.</p>
