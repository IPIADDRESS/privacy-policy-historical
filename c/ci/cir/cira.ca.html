        <p>We, the Canadian Internet  Registration Authority (CIRA) are dedicated to maintaining both a high standard  of privacy and a high standard of data protection in all of our activities. We  must balance that respect for the privacy rights of our customers, employees  and contractors with our public responsibilities in the administration of the  Canadian country code top-level domain (dot-ca). We also must consider the responsibility  of ensuring that thorough security measures are in effect. This may involve  verifying and testing assertions, practices, and the conduct of individuals and  organizations and may have an impact on, or involve the use of, personal  information. This privacy policy (the “Policy”), based on the standard required  by the <em>Personal Information  Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (PIPEDA) namely the Canadian  Standard CAN/CSA-Q-830, reflects CIRA’s interpretation of these  responsibilities. We welcome your comments and suggestions. The Policy is  divided into 10 sections.<br>
Capitalized terms used in this  Policy that are not defined in this Policy have the meanings specified in  By-Law No. 1 of CIRA.</p>

		<ol type="a">
          <li>the name; </li>

        <p>All contractors and other third  parties with whom we have a contractual arrangement and with whom we share  personal data are contractually obligated to ensure that their practices meet  our standards and are fully compliant with PIPEDA and other applicable privacy  legislation.</p>
		
        <p><a name="Purpose"></a><strong>3. Purpose </strong><a href="#INDEX">(back to Index)</a></p>
		
        <p>Our primary business is to operate the dot-ca. This entails the management of personal data. Historically,  much of the information about Registrants that has been collected by domain  name registries, whether the Registrants are natural or legal persons, has been  made available over the Internet through the WHOIS database and we too offer certain Registrant information via the WHOIS in accordance with this policy.</p>
		
        <p>We require the information for  the reasonable purposes of the operation of the Registry and the  implementation, execution, and enforcement of the applicable Registry policies,  rules, and procedures. We, in essence, act as the repository for the  information. This permits greater flexibility and transferability of domain  names from Registrant to Registrant or Registrar to Registrar. In addition, it  permits us to fulfill our overall role and mandate as an independent and neutral  third party, to ensure public policy objectives in the operation of the Registry,  such as fair competition, management of a scarce resource, reasonable access  for all, and protection of privacy and personal information. In addition,  personal information about Registrants may be collected and used for the  following additional purposes:</p>
		
        <ul>
          <li>To register a dot-ca domain name; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>To manage a dot-ca Domain Name Registration; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>To enable others to check a registration; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>To maintain membership records; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>To contact Registrants about CIRA member issues, domain name registration issues, and in order to facilitate the resolution of any kind of dispute (be it via the CIRA Dispute Resolution Process or any other judicial process); </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>To contact Registrants in order to forward to them correspondence sent to a Registrant via CIRA by a third party;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>To ensure good customer service, in the event a Registrant requires support or makes inquiries; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>To identify the individual(s) to law enforcement agencies, competent courts, and other competent judicial bodies under       appropriate legal circumstances; and </li>
        </ul>
		<ul>
        <li>To enable us to manage the dot-ca Registry in accordance with our by-laws.</li></ul> 
        
        <p>Personal information may be  gathered from the public and used in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If an individual visits our website, the web server logs IP addresses and associated information relating to the requests       made; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>If an individual initiates a CIRA process, then we may gather transactional information as part of the process; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>If an individual makes an inquiry or complaint, applies for a job, or visits the premises; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>If an individual responds to a survey or a call for public comment; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If an individual registers for a CIRA event, activity, or contest; and</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
          <li>If an individual corresponds with us in writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, regardless as to how  and from whom we collected information, we will not sell or provide your  personal information to any organization for any purpose other than in  compliance with the Policy.</p>
        <p><a name="q4"><b>4. Consent</b></a> <a href="#index">(back to Index)</a></p>
        <p>We, pursuant to the Purpose,  require the submission of personal information from any individual who wishes  to become a Registrant for the purpose of registration of domain names. We have  attempted to limit the information we collect to that which is necessary for  this purpose. Domain name registration is done online, and we seek the positive  affirmation of all Registrants:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That they have read and understood this policy; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>That they understand that we require the information for the proper operation of the Registry; and </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>That they agree to the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information as described herein. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Individuals may withdraw consent for the further use of their information at any time, by contacting our Chief  Privacy Officer. However, if the information in question is that which must be  collected in order to register a domain name, withdrawing consent will lead to  the cancellation of the Domain Name Registration.</p>

        <p>As part of our administration  of the dot-ca registry, we operate an electronic look-up service called the  WHOIS. The WHOIS is designed to provide limited information to site visitors  about assigned dot-ca domain names for the following purposes: (a) to allow  network administrators to find and fix system problems and to generally maintain  the stability of the Internet; (b) to help combat inappropriate uses of the  Internet such as spam or fraud; (c) to facilitate the identification of  instances of trademark infringement; and (d) generally to enhance  accountability of dot-ca domain name Registrants. More generally, the WHOIS  permits us to fulfill our primary role and mandate as an independent and  neutral top level domain name registry and to ensure the attainment of public  policy objectives in the operation of the dot-ca registry, including the  facilitation of fair competition, the management of a scarce resource, the  maintenance of reasonable access for all and the protection of privacy and  personal information. </p>

Our rules governing WHOIS are  set forth below.</p>

              <p> The following information concerning dot-ca domains  registered to Registrants who are individuals and who are Canadian citizens,  permanent residents, legal representatives or aboriginal persons as they are  all defined in the General Registration Rules (collectively referred to as  “Individual Registrants” for the purposes of this Part 6 of this Policy) shall  be made accessible to interested third parties through the WHOIS:</p>

                <li>                   the registration date of each Domain Name  Registration; </li>

              <p><strong>6.1.2 Disclosure of Additional Information to Registrars who are not the  Registrant’s Registrar of Record.</strong></p>
              <p>                For the reasonable purposes of the operation of the Registry  as described in Part 3 above and, more specifically, to facilitate Registrar to  Registrar transfers, merge transactions, Registrant to Registrant transfers,  the addition of new Domain Name Registrations to an existing Individual  Registrant profile and any other transaction for which the relevant Registrar  who is not the Registrant’s Registrar of Record reasonably requires additional  Registration Information, as  determined by us at our reasonable discretion, the following information will  be disclosed by us to the relevant Registrar who is not the Individual  Registrant’s Registrar of Record: </p>
              <ol type="a">

              <p><strong>6.1.3 Consent to Disclose Additional Registration Information via the WHOIS.</strong> </p>
              <p>                  An Individual Registrant may voluntarily opt to disclose  via the WHOIS, and in accordance with this section 6.1.3, more registration  information than is provided for in section 6.1.1, including:</p>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>                 Individual Registrant name; </li>

              </ol>
              <p>Our ability to control the uses made of information  disclosed via the WHOIS is very limited, regardless of whether that information  becomes subject to domestic or foreign privacy laws when acquired by a third  party. Nonetheless, we have sought to impose limitations, through section 6.1.5  of this Policy, upon third party uses of WHOIS data.</p>
              <p><strong>6.1.4 Registrants other than Individual  Registrants as Defined Above.</strong></p>
              <p>                In the normal course, all registration information  collected by us from Registrants of dot-ca domain names who are not individuals  will be made accessible to the public through the WHOIS no less than thirty-one  days after the date of registration. However, Registrants of dot-ca domain  names who are not individuals may request, in writing via postal mail, that the  information described in section 6.1.2 not be disclosed by us to the public via  the WHOIS. We may, at our reasonable discretion, permit such a request. If we  accede to the request, information as set out in section 6.1.2 will only be  disclosed thereafter in accordance with the terms for disclosure applicable to  Individual Registrants. </p>
              <p>                In the written request referred to above, the Registrant  who is not an individual must certify that it has a legitimate need to protect  the privacy of its information, which need is greater than that of other CIRA  Registrants who are not individuals, because the nature of that Registrant’s  operations or activities is such that disclosure of its information via the  WHOIS would be likely to cause harm to individuals or to that Registrant. The  Registrant who is not an individual should provide a short confidential  explanation to CIRA explaining how it meets these criteria.</p>
              <p>                CIRA retains the discretion to determine in any case  whether a Registrant who is not an Individual meets the criteria and will be  permitted to opt out of standard disclosure of information in the WHOIS.</p></td>

        </ol>
        <p>          Information acquired from the WHOIS shall not be  used for any purposes other than those referenced above. Purposes which are  prohibited shall include, but are not limited to, the carrying out of any  activities which are unsolicited and can reasonably be viewed as involving the  harvesting of WHOIS addresses (electronic or otherwise) for the purpose of  transmitting by e-mail, telephone, facsimile, or regular mail any commercial  advertising; the performance of market research; solicitation activities;  and/or or any other purposes which may be reasonably viewed as intrusive to a  reasonable domain name holder. No user of the WHOIS is permitted to utilize  automated and/or electronic processes that send queries or data to the WHOIS,  except as is reasonably necessary to register domain names or modify existing  registrations.</p>

        <p>It is important that the  information we obtain from Registrants is accurate. Information  that we will act on, (such as contact information, complaints, disputes,  resumes, etc.) must be accurate. If you think we have information about you  that is not accurate, you are encouraged to contact us at the address provided  in Section 10 of this policy and indicate the necessary changes. We may require  that you follow certain procedures that are utilized by us for the  authentication and verification of your identity. 
We retain information according to retention schedules, which depend on the  purpose of the information and any legal or contractual requirements with which  we might need to comply.</p>

        <p>It is important that the  information maintained by us on behalf of Registrants is accurate, protected  from interference by other parties, and treated in confidence by as few  personnel as necessary. We maintain state of the art firewall and antivirus  protection on our servers, train our staff, and hire only responsible and  capable contractors to manage our systems.

Upon receipt of a request from you, our CPO will send you, by email, mail, or  facsimile, an “Access Request Form” or a “Correction Request Form” for you to  fill out. Provided we can, to our satisfaction, authenticate your identity and  subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law, you will be given reasonable  access to your personal information and/or you will be entitled to challenge  the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it appropriately  amended. Please note that the provisions under PIPEDA for access to personal  information and the right to correct records are not intended to replace  existing procedures. If you are interested in correcting information, related  to your Domain Name Registration, (after having reviewed the information you  obtained from us via this procedure), we will be pleased to forward the request  to your registrar. The routine procedures for correcting registration  information will be followed, unless you have described to us extraordinary  circumstances that would warrant the use of a different procedure. In most  cases, the routine procedures are the most efficient procedures for correcting  registration information.</p>
        <p>          At the time of your request, we  may need further information from you to verify your identity, before we can  provide you with the personal information we hold.<br>
          There may be instances when we  will not be able to provide you with the personal information that you request.  For example. if the personal information:</p>
