<h2>Information About You </h2>
<h6>We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect "Personal Information", which generally speaking is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, age and address. We also collect "Non-personal Information", which is information about you that does not itself identify you individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", which is information about use of our site, such as pages visited on our Site. The information we collect depends on what services and features you use on our Site. The following is a more detailed explanation of these types of information as well as when and how we collect and use it.</h6>

<h2>Co-Branded Service Offerings </h2>
<h6>We may share this information with certain businesses with whom Circle K has formed a strategic alliance.

Also, if Circle K Stores Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.</h6>
<h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
<h6>We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.</h6>
<p>We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to circlek.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.</p>
<p>This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this statement.</p>
<h2>Cookies </h2>
<h6>We may make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site which may correlate other information, including personally identifying information, with the cookie.</h6>
<p>We may use cookies to allow us to automate access and data entry functions of our Site such as to correlate online ordering information for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas which are useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update the Site effectively.</p>
<p>You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, the Site may not function properly or permit access.</p>
<h2>Use of Clear .gifs, Web Beacons and Web Bugs </h2>
<h6>We may use clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) on our site or other sites and may permit third parties to place them on our site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or e-mail message. Clear gifs are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" of the Web page to see whether the page is using a clear gif. </h6>
<p>Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular Web site. Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites </h2>
<h6>Please be aware that we provide links to third-party Web sites as a service to our visitors, and that we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those pages. Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of Circle K. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.</h6>
<h2>Children </h2>
<h6>Our Site is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on this Site. We request that parents supervise their children while online.&nbsp; Some areas of our site contain information or content about products that are inappropriate for children.&nbsp; These areas request the visitor to attest to his or her age.</h6>
<h2>Security </h2>
<h6>We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party:</h6>
<p>We encrypt order information, including credit card numbers, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that our customers' information is safe as it is sent over the Internet to our server. </p>
<p>The Site uses reasonable security procedures to maintain the confidentiality of information. However, because the Internet is a public and open facility, no security measures can guarantee complete confidentiality under all circumstances. To help preserve your confidentiality, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password. This privacy policy statement does not create any contractual or legal rights on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Access </h2>
<h6>On this web site, you may elect to change or delete your preferences to receive information and emails from us or any third party as described by this statement. You can access your communication preferences on this site at any time to make such changes.&nbsp;</h6>
<h2>Opting-Out of Promotional Materials</h2>
<h6>As noted above, we may use your e-mail address and other contact information provided to us through the Site or from email communications to send you promotional materials from us or third parties. If you do not want to receive such promotional information, you can change your privacy preference and remove yourself from our e-mail list at any time:<br>&nbsp;<br>If you receive email communications from our Site, please use the unsubscribe link contained in the email. </h6>
<p>If you have NOT completed the registration process or are unable to locate the link, please e-mail your request to be removed to <a href="mailto:B2C_WEB@circlek.com">B2C_WEB@circlek.com</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any preference that you select, we may contact you from time to time to provide services that you have requested or for customer service matters, such as responding to service-related inquiries, updating our policies, or notifying you of changes to existing services.</p>
