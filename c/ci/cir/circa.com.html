				    What are cookies and how does ProCaps Laboratories use cookies on its site?
					</b>
					<br>
					Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's disk 
					drive. A cookie may contain information such as a unique user ID that is used to track the 
					pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies to customize your shopping experience 
					and for our own internal business purposes but do not store personally identifiable 
					information in your cookie. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site, but you

					<br>
					Cookies can be modified or disabled through your browser options. If you turn off

					allow you access to your account information including items stored in your shopping bag.

				</p><p><b><a name="6" id="6"></a>What about links to other websites and services?</b>
					<br>
					ProCaps Laboratories web sites may contain links to other sites not maintained by 
					ProCaps Laboratories. You should review the privacy policies of any of these sites 
					individually before providing any personal information to those sites, as we do not 
					control the privacy policies or practices of these web sites. ProCaps Laboratories

					share your personal information with other parties.  
					<span class="navGray">[ <a href="#">back to top</a> ]</span>
				</p><p><b><a name="7" id="7"></a>Is my information secure?</b>
					<br>
					We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we use SSL (Secure Socket 
					Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of 
					your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by 
					SSL. <span class="navGray">[ <a href="#">back to top</a> ]</span>
				</p><p>SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone 
				    other than ProCaps Laboratories. To check the security of your connection, look for an 
				    unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your web browser). This and a change in 
				    the first characters of the site address from "http" to "http<b>s</b>" alert you that SSL is active.

					GoDaddy.com has issued ProCaps Laboratories a unique ID, which assures 
					visitors they have reached our authentic site thereby allowing communications to be 
					encrypted for privacy.

					We endeavor to make every transaction you make at ProCaps Laboratories’ web sites 
					100% safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your 
					card as a result of shopping at ProCaps Laboratories.
