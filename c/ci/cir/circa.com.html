											                        We want your online shopping to be worry-free, so we use SSL (Secure Socket 
											                        Layers), the most advanced online ordering security system available. All of 
											                        your personal information, including your credit card number, is encrypted by 
											                        SSL. <a href="#"><span>[back to top]</span></a>
										                        </p><p>SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone 
													                other than ProCaps Laboratories. To check the security of your connection, 
											                        look for an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your web browser). This 
											                        and a change in the first characters of the site address from "http" to "http<b>s</b>" 
											                        alert you that SSL is active.
