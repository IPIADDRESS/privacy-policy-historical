<p class="p1"><b>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We use information held about you in the following ways:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Information you give to us.</b> We will use this information:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To notify you about changes to our service;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To deal with payment queries and problems with card top ups or other payment systems</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For our marketing purposes we would like to contact you by post, email, SMS and telephone about goods and services that we provide that we think you may be interested in and where we have a legitimate interest to do so. We will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) where we have your consent to do so. You can tell us to stop marketing you at any time;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information by post, email, SMS and telephone about other goods or services that we feel may interest you. Where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we will only do this where we are satisfied that there is a legitimate interest to do so and we (or they) will only contact you by electronic means if you have consented to this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Information we collect about you.</b> We will use this information:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To administer our site and for internal operations, including, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To improve our site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our site about goods or services that may interest you or them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Information we receive from other sources.</b> We will combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>3. REASONS WE CAN COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law on data protection sets out a number of different legal grounds upon which organisations can rely to allow the collection and processing of personal data. We rely on the following as set out below </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Consent</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In some cases we will specifically ask for your consent to process your data e.g. by ticking a box or confirming verbally that you consent. In these cases we will always clearly explain what we will do with your data and will keep a record of your consent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Contractual Obligations</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In other cases, we will need to use your personal data to actually do what you are asking us to do and to perform our contract with you. E.g. to help with payment or card top up issues we will need your name and card number.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Legal Compliance</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Legitimate Interest</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests. For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers that we think will be of interest to you and your business. We will also use your address and phone number to contact you with direct marketing information by post and phone, telling you about products and services that we think may be of interest to you and your business.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><b>4. WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We share your personal information;</span></p>
