			<h5 id="section-1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</h5>
			<p>We collect two categories of information from users of our Site — “Personally Identifiable Information” and “Non-Personally Identifiable Information”. We collect this information so we can offer you our services and products and give you an efficient and customized experience with our Site.</p>
			<p>“<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i>” is information you voluntarily give us that specifically identifies you.</p>
			<p>When you create or register an account, purchase products or services, participate in any of our programs, send us questions or feedback, register your e-mail address with us, communicate with us, or otherwise participate in our Site, we may ask you to give us information about yourself. You have the option to use our Site, and if you do use our Site, we will ask you to give us and we will collect the following Personally Identifiable Information: your first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, payment method and other information once it is associated with you. We may also collect information about your movie preferences, your purchases and information you disclose to the general public through review pages, blogs and message boards. This Policy refers to this personal information as “Personally Identifiable Information”.</p>
			<p>“<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i>” is information that does not identify you or any specific person.</p>
			<p>When you visit our Site, we automatically collect information relevant to your visit, such as the frequency and length of your visit to our Site, what website you came from, the search engine you used, which website you go to next, what web browser and operating system you use, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Again, this non-personal information is not associated with any specific individual. This Policy refers to this non-personal information as “Non-Personally Identifiable Information”.</p>
			<h5 id="section-2">2. WHERE AND WHEN DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h5>
			<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you participate in our Site, such as when you create or register an account, purchase products or services, participate in any of our programs, send us questions or feedback, register your e-mail address with us, communicate with us, or otherwise participate in our Site. We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes for which you provided it to us, such as providing you with our products and services, and enhancing the quality of our Site for you. We will also use your Personally Identifiable Information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts and to customize our Site’s content and services for you and all of our customers. Sometimes we will use your Personally Identifiable Information to notify you of important changes to this Policy, and to send you news, offers and savings related to our products and services.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we might combine or supplement your Personally Identifiable Information with information we receive from our affiliates or third-party providers. If we do combine or supplement your Personally Identifiable Information, we will treat all of that information as covered by this Policy.</p>
			<p>We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you visit our Site. Additionally, we may engage third-party providers or advertisers to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information and share that non-personal information with us. This Non-Personally Identifiable Information is not specific to you and may be aggregated with Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected from other users.</p>
			<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to improve our Site and troubleshoot issues related to our Site, such as our servers and software. We also use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to better understand our Site and user demographics, provide you with better products and services, and provide advertisements that may be of interest to you.</p>
			<h5 id="section-3">3. WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</h5>
			<p>We share Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information among ourselves, such as our affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share Personally Identifiable Information with our service providers, partners and third-party services providers to deliver to you the products or services you have requested. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the products and services purchased on our Site or give your address to the delivery service company so they can deliver your product to you. We will encourage our third-party service providers and partners to respect your privacy, but we (and you acknowledge that we) cannot control how they use your Personally Identifiable Information and this Policy does not govern their use of your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
			<p>When we share your Personally Identifiable Information among our affiliates and subsidiaries, your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred outside of the United States of America. If you do not want us to transfer your Personally Identifiable Information outside of the United States of America, do not give us your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
			<p>If we later decide that we want to sell, rent or otherwise transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to others who are not our affiliates, subsidiaries, or authorized third-party service providers or partners, we will first get your permission. If you opt-in to receive communications from us and our third-party service providers and partners, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information as necessary to supply you with those communications.</p>
			<p>We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with third-party advertisers or other parties outside ourselves to improve our Site and enhance your online experience. Again, this Non-Personally Identifiable Information is not specific to you and does not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
			<p>If you have authorized third-parties, such as a social networking services like Facebook or Twitter, to gather information about your activities on our Site (<i>e.g.</i>, to notify your friends that you have purchased movie tickets), we may share Personally Identifiable Information with these third-parties as previously authorized by you.</p>
			<p>As part of our ongoing business operations, we may transfer Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information as part of a business transaction, such as a merger or corporate purchase and sale. In this connection, your Personally Identifiable Information will be treated as a business asset and possibly transferred to a business that will control or own us and our assets.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we might be required by law to share your Personally Identifiable Information with others, such as in response to a court order, subpoena or government investigation. Also, we reserve the right to share your Personally Identifiable Information with others when we believe it is reasonably necessary to protect others and ourselves.</p>
			<p>Your California Privacy Rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors of our Site who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes. You have the right to request information regarding such disclosure by contacting us at Cinépolis Luxury Cinemas, Attention: Privacy Manager, at: 8383 Wilshire Blvd. Ste. 302, Beverly Hills CA, 90211, or <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@cinepolis.com">privacypolicy@cinepolis.com</a>.
