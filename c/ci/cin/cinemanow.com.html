We may change this Privacy Policy without notice from time to time.

<strong>Information We Collect</strong>
<br><br>
The goal of CinemaNow is to provide you with the information, services and resources that are most relevant and useful to consumers interested in our products. To do this, CinemaNow sometimes needs to collect information about you. We collect two types of information through our Service, "anonymous information" and "personal information."
<br><br>
Anonymous information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. Each time a visitor comes to the Service, CinemaNow collects some information to improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience and to provide aggregate reporting back to third party content providers. CinemaNow also collects aggregate search terms from its search services for internal reporting and targeted content presentation (that is, web pages which are dynamically displayed based on your individual interests). CinemaNow collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted content.
<br><br>
In addition to anonymous data, CinemaNow may also collect personal information. Personal information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address, credit card information, email address, or products or services you purchase. CinemaNow will collect personal information about you when you register on the Service, purchase or rent content from CinemaNow, participate in surveys or promotional offers, or request information or support from CinemaNow.
<br><br>  
Most of the personal information is gathered when you purchase or rent content on the Service for the first time. When you make purchases, you have the option to save your billing information.  This is so that the next time you come back and make another purchase you don't have to enter all of your information again.  If you choose to save your credit card information it will display in the My Account section of the Service.  This section requires your login for access.
<br><br>
CinemaNow may also specifically ask you whether we may send you information about products and services related to a CinemaNow purchase.
<br><br>
If you contact CinemaNow, we may keep a record of that correspondence, including your email address. We use that information so that we may respond to that email, and for future reference.
<br><br>
<strong>What Are "Cookies" And How Does CinemaNow Use Them?</strong>
<br><br>
A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you and track your activities on the Service. This unique number identifies your browser to computers whenever you visit the Service making use of them. A cookie will not allow a web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed.
<br><br>
In order to improve the Service, we use cookies to track your visits. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Please see the user guide or help section of your browser to make this change. Parts of the Service may require an authorization, and so cookies may not be optional; users choosing not to accept cookies may not be able to access parts of the Service or to use some or all of the products and/or services otherwise available on the Service.  Please note: disabling or deleting cookies could mean that you won't have access to the movies you have purchased or rented from us.  When you click on "My Videos", the videos that you have already purchased might not be listed in your account.
<br><br>
<strong>Who Collects the Information?</strong>
<br><br>
When you provide information to CinemaNow, that information is collected and maintained either by CinemaNow or by an authorized agent of CinemaNow such as web hosting companies, customer care service providers, and transaction processing service providers, unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of collection.
<br><br>
<strong>How Do We Use the Information?</strong>
<br><br>
Any personal information you provide to CinemaNow on the Service is maintained and accessible only by CinemaNow and its authorized agents and business partners, unless specifically stated otherwise. CinemaNow may request information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across the Service, including personalized services, interactive communications, discussion groups, and many other types of content and services.
<br><br> 
The following are examples of how CinemaNow may use the information it collects:
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may provide you with technical support, updates to products and services, and upgrades to newer products as they become available.
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may use the information to track the use of content provided by third parties for reporting purposes, such as tracking and reporting which titles are purchased, rented or burned to disc, how often specific titles are purchased or rented, and how much of the title is watched each time.  We may also use the information to track the success of certain third party partner offerings.
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may offer its users the ability to personalize content such as news, local resources, links to other web sites, and more.
<br><br> 
If you visited the Service through a device or website offered by a third party partner, we may be sharing some of your information with that partner.  
<br><br> 
CinemaNow occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests and promotions. If you request, we may use contact data from our promotions to send you information we think you will find useful, such as information about new products or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe, so you will not receive our emails in the future.
<br><br> 
To process your order on our online store(s), we may require name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. In general, we will try to contact you first by email and only if that fails, or if time is critical, will we try to contact you by phone.
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users to the appropriate governmental authorities. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, CinemaNow may voluntarily provide information to appropriate governmental authorities. If you are a member of the military, you should not register any personally identifiable information at the Service in the eventuality that it may be subpoenaed. 
<br><br> 
CinemaNow sometimes uses an individual registered user's data to "pre-populate" forms that are displayed when that user has logged in for the purpose of collecting individual data by CinemaNow and/or its advertisers and sponsors.
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors, advertisers and other third parties as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on specific pages or advertisement(s). We may also disclose to such third-parties the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on advertisements.
<br><br> 
In the event CinemaNow sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, or if CinemaNow (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, CinemaNow may provide to such entity customer and visitor information (both aggregate and personally identifiable) that is related to that part of the business that was sold to or merged with the other entity.
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may send you email or otherwise contact you about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you, including, without limitation notification of sales, coupons, newsletters and other communications. Registering your product indicates that you have informed us of your interest, and we will contact you after registration unless you specify that you do not wish to receive such contact by notifying us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sonic.com" class="linkgray"><strong>privacy@sonic.com</strong></a>. For those who elect to receive such materials from CinemaNow or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, CinemaNow will release personally identifiable information. Information released may include your name, email address and other information supplied in the CinemaNow registration process, and only when you specifically grant us that right. You may opt-out of any CinemaNow communications at any time. CinemaNow also uses aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Service, and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. Without such data, we would not know what the most popular areas of the Service are, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.
<br><br> 
CinemaNow may, from time to time, use your information to contact you about changes or enhancements to CinemaNow products and services.
<br><br>
<strong>With whom does CinemaNow share the information that is collected?</strong>
<br><br>
Information about our customers and visitors to the Service is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described in this Privacy Policy and with affiliates, business partners, subsidiaries and agents that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.  If you visited the Service through a device or website offered by a third party partner, we may be sharing some of your information with that partner, including personal information.    
<br><br>
When you submit personal information to CinemaNow, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which CinemaNow and its affiliates, business partners, and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States which may not provide the same statutory protection as your country of residence.
<br><br>
You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors, agents, or service providers of CinemaNow. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.
<br><br>
CinemaNow has established relationships with various service providers whose services are available to you from the CinemaNow Service or from web sites that are linked to the CinemaNow Service. Typically, these providers offer services that CinemaNow customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with CinemaNow products and services. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personally identifiable or other information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personally identifiable information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such web site, and personally identifiable information that you provide while on the Service in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. As noted above, you are solely responsible for reading and understanding the privacy and other policies of these service providers and all other third party web sites you visit. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with CinemaNow personal information collected from you. If we do receive information from a third party service provider, we may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. You should also be aware that our agreements with certain business partners whose products and/or services you have elected to acquire may require that CinemaNow share certain personal information collected from you relating to those business partners' products and/or services. Information CinemaNow collects from you that is shared with business partners under such an agreement will be used by those business partners only in accordance with their privacy policies.
<br><br>
<strong>What kinds of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?</strong>
<br><br>
CinemaNow has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data under our control. We have implemented rules and procedures designed to limit access to the information you provide us. Despite the steps we take to ensure the protection of your information, unfortunately we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur. To better protect you, we encrypt particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers collected for a commerce transaction on the Service, prior to transmission. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure, CinemaNow will do everything commercially reasonable to limit and remedy the disclosure, but CinemaNow accepts no liability for any unintentional disclosure. In addition, in the unlikely event that any government or private individual seeks information, CinemaNow will not voluntarily provide the information, but will obey any court order requiring disclosure.
<br><br>
You are responsible for the security of your CinemaNow ID and password. Please take care when using and storing them. CinemaNow recommends that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
<br><br>
<strong>CinemaNow notice regarding the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998</strong>
<br><br>
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 provides safeguards to protect children who use the Internet by regulating the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. CinemaNow does not sell products or services for purchase by children, and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use the Service only in conjunction with your parents or guardians. CinemaNow and the Service do not target children as an audience or a market, and CinemaNow does not collect information about the age of Service users. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child we will make all reasonable efforts to delete that data from our records.
<br><br>
<strong>Updating your personal information and privacy preferences.</strong>
<br><br>
Upon your request, we will deactivate your CinemaNow ID, contact information, billing information, shipping information, and financial information from our active databases to prevent your information from being shared with other users. To make this request, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@sonic.com" class="linkgray"><strong>privacy@sonic.com</strong></a>. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your CinemaNow ID activity and in accordance with our deactivation policies and procedures and applicable law.
<br><br>
We will make our best effort to remove your information from our active communication files upon request. Please note, however, that we will retain certain information in order to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce the policies, procedures and agreements set forth on the Service.
<br><br>
<strong>Inquiries and Complaints</strong>
<br><br>
If you have any concern about privacy at CinemaNow, please send us a thorough description of your concern to <a href="mailto:privacy@sonic.com" class="linkgray"><strong>privacy@sonic.com</strong></a>, and we will try to resolve it.
<br><br>
<strong>Disputes</strong>
<br><br>
If you choose to visit any CinemaNow web site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="terms.aspx" class="linkgray"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the State of California.

<!-- End SiteCatalyst code version: H.20.3. -->

    <!--
    Couple of changes. Minor change by adding type and language to the script tag.
    Also, since IE5 and later implemented that [0] should be the first node but W3C standard says [1] should be the first node, I added a test to see what browswer the user was using. If IE, set the childNodes[0], else childNodes[1]
