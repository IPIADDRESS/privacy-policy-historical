Cookies
</h3>
<p>
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device and to improve his user experience.
</p>
<ul class="normal">
<li>
Persistent cookies - these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
</li>
<li>
Session cookies - these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

<h4>
Cookies used on the Website
</h4>
<p>
A list of all the cookies that can be used on the Website by category is set out below:
</p>
<ul class="normal">
<li>
Strictly necessary cookies - these cookies enable services that are necessary for you as a user of our Services. For those types of cookies no consent is required. These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Website. Without these cookies services like shopping baskets or online billing could not be provided.
</li>
<li>
Performance cookies - these cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect are aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Website works.
</li>
<li>
Functionality cookies - These cookies remember choices you make in order to improve your experience. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. These cookies allow the Website to remember the choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
</li>
<li>
Targeting or advertising cookies - These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They are usually placed by trusted advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. In many cases, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other company.
</p>
<h4>
Behavioral advertising and online privacy
</h4>
<p>
A guide to behavioral advertising and online privacy has been put together by the internet advertising industry and can be found at www.youronlinechoices.eu. The guide contains an explanation of the IAB’s self-regulatory scheme to allow you greater control of the advertising you see.
</p>
<h4>
Using browser settings to manage cookies
</h4>
<p>
The Help menu of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You may also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website’s essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on. For example, if you block or otherwise reject cookies you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Basket, proceed to Checkout, or use any of our products and services that require you to Sign in. In case you are using a shared computer, remember to sign off when you finish using the Services in order to secure access to your account.
