Note to Parents/Children's Privacy

Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect information on our Websites from those children we actually know are
under 13 years of age. In addition, no part of our Websites are targeted to attract anyone under 13 years of age. We request that children under 13 years
of age do not disclose or provide any Personal Information. If we discover such information, we will delete the child's Personal Information from our
records. If for any reason we believe a user may be under the age of 13 we reserve the right to request proof of age of such user. If such proof is not
provided, or if it is discovered a user is under the age of 13 all Personal Information of that user shall be deleted from our servers and associated
systems and we reserve the right to limit and/or ban such user from our Websites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cineplex may from time to time conduct,
sponsor, co-sponsor or participate in contests and/or promotions which may be open to entrants of all ages, including children under the age of 13. During
such contests and/or promotions Cineplex makes special efforts to encourage children to consult with their parents before providing Personal Information
and in each case parental consent must be obtained in order for any such entry or participation to be valid. Cineplex also believes that parents should
supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools, available from online services and software manufacturers, to help
provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other Personal
Information without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please visit    <a href="http://www.icra.org/">http://www.icra.org/_en/parents.</a>
