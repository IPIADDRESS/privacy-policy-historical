                    collected offline by LCE (unless specifically stated), or 
                    its affiliated companies. At LCE, your privacy is important 
                    to us. We provide this notice to explain our information collection 
                    practices and the choices you have about the way your information 
                    is collected and used. All Loews Cineplex Entertainment websites, 
                    including enjoytheshow.com, CineplexOdeon.com and MagicJohnsonTheatres.com 
                    are currently covered by this Privacy Policy. Your use of 
                    this Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accept

                  <p>While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to other web 
                    sites or online materials. For example, enjoytheshow.com contains 
                    links to web sites that may be published and maintained by 
                    an affiliate and/or related entity of LCE. You may also encounter 
                    links from our sponsors or partners, which linked web sites 
                    may include a reference to LCE or an LCE logo as part of a 
                    co-branding agreement. Those other web sites may set their 
                    own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies 
                    that differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy 
                    only covers information collected by LCE on this Web Site,

                  <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable

                    user forums (such as chat rooms, message boards, or similar 
                    web pages). PII is information that could reasonably used 
                    to identify you personally (such as your name, address, or 
                    e-mail address). You should be aware that when you voluntarily 
                    disclose PII on message boards, chat areas or other user forums, 
                    that information can be collected and used by other people 
                    to send unsolicited messages and marketing materials. Also, 
                    please be aware that certain message boards (and similar user 
                    forums) may display IP addresses along with the message poster's 
                    name and message. We bear no responsibility for any action 
                    or policies of any third parties who collect any information 
                    users may disclose in user forums or other public areas of

                  <p>Generally, you may browse our Web Site without providing 
                    any PII. However, we may ask you to provide PII at various 
                    times and places on this Web Site, such as when you register 
                    for our services, enter a sweepstakes, subscribe to a newsletter, 
                    complete a survey or participate in polls, message groups

                    request that all visitors under 13 to our Web Site not disclose 
                    or provide any PII. If we discover that a child under 13 has 
                    provided us with PII, we will delete the child's PII from

                  <p>Log Data: When you visit this Web Site, our web servers automatically 
                    collect anonymous information that describes how our visitors 
                    use and navigate our Web Site, and which includes the number 
                    and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length 
                    of their stays, as well as the anonymous information automatically 
                    sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer 
                    data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent 
                    to visiting our Web Site, and IP addresses. We also may determine 
                    what technology is available through your browser in order 
                    to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. For 
                    example, we may determine that you have installed a version 
                    of Flash, and we will then send you the appropriate Flash 
                    version of the web page rather than an HTML page.</p>
                  <p>IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is assigned 
                    to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. 
                    When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers 
                    log the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses 
                    for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, 
                    to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to 
                    audit the number of visits to different pages on our Web Site.</p>
                  <p>Cookies: Cookies are information files that our Web Site 
                    may place on your computer to provide extended functionality. 
                    We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking 
                    usage patterns on the Web Site, measuring the effectiveness 
                    of advertising, or limiting multiple responses and registrations 
                    when we conduct polls and sweepstakes. We do not store any 
                    PII in cookies, and we do not link the cookies to any PII 
                    we collect. We will not use cookies to retrieve information 
                    from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you 
                    in a cookie. Advertisers or other third parties that are serving 
                    content on some of our pages may set and access their own 
                    cookies on your computer. Such third parties' use of cookies 
                    is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ 
                    from this one. Such third parties do not have access to our 
                    cookies. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer 
                    by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in 
                    your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our 
                    Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. 
                    You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer 
                    if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.</p>
                  <p>Web Beacons: While you are on our Web Site, or while you 
                    are otherwise viewing our content, you may encounter Web beacons, 
                    which may come from LCE or from third parties, such as advertisers 
                    or content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also 
                    called a Web bug or "clear gif", is a small graphic 
                    image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, 
                    which generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to 
                    monitor certain information about the viewer of the Web page, 
                    Web-based document or e-mail message, and it may allow access 
                    to certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the 
                    user, because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). 
                    However, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of 
                    a Web page, including an advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. 
                    Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page the Web 
                    beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web 
                    beacon, the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon 
                    is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons 
                    can also be linked to PII, but LCE does not link information 
                    gathered through Web beacons to PII. LCE may use Web beacons 
                    to count visitors to our Web pages and we may include Web 
                    beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count 
                    how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) 
                    we sent were actually opened. We aggregate all information 
                    we collect through Web beacons and we do not use Web beacons 
                    to track any individuals' use of the Web Site. LCE does not 
                    have control over Web beacons used by third parties and does 
                    not have access to whatever information they may collect.<br>

                    THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT </b></p>
                  <p>We use the PII you provide about yourself to provide the 
                    information or content you have requested, to contact you 
                    about our programs, products, features or services or for 
                    other purposes disclosed at the time of collection. For instance, 
                    we may notify you that you have won a sweepstakes, send you 
                    an e-mail newsletter or send you information about an upcoming 
                    contest or movie. If you e-mail someone else an electronic 
                    greeting card or other special feature from our Web Site, 
                    we will use the information you provide about someone else 
                    to send that person the requested e-mail. If you do not wish 
                    to receive information about our programs, products, features 
                    or services, you may update your preferences at any time by 
                    returning to the registration area of the Web Site for which 
                    you registered.</p>
                  <p>We may send you information from our corporate affiliates, 
                    including Fandango, Inc. and certain movie distributors. If 
                    you do not wish to receive this information, you may opt out 
                    of such use at any time by returning to the registration area 
                    of the Web Site for which you registered.</p>
                  <p>We use non-identifying information collected on our Web Site 
                    in the aggregate to better understand your use of the Web 
                    Site and to enhance your enjoyment and experience. For example, 
                    we may use the information to improve the design and content 
                    of our Web Site or to analyze the programs and services we 
                    offer. We may also share non-identifying aggregate information 
                    with third parties. For example, we may tell advertisers how 
                    many individuals visit certain areas of our Web Site, or how 
                    many men or women receive our newsletters.</p>
                  <p>We may share your PII with outside parties who sponsor sweepstakes 
                    or other promotions on our Web Site. However, we will not 
                    share your PII with outside parties unless you specifically 
                    agree to a governing set of rules that allow such disclosure 
                    or otherwise give us permission to do so.</p>
                  <p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform 
                    functions on our behalf. For instance, we may use third parties 
                    to host message boards or other user forums, to develop software 
                    applications and databases or to send communications on our 
                    behalf. Our employees, agents and contractors who have access 
                    to PII are required to protect the information in a manner 
                    that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                  <p>We may provide access to your PII when legally required to 
                    do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal 
                    proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use 
                    of our Web Site, to limit our legal liability and protect 
                    our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of
