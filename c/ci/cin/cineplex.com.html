In addition, no part of our website is targeted to attract anyone under 13 years of age.  We request that children under 13 years of age do not disclose or provide any <strong>Personal Information</strong>.  If we discover such information, we will delete the child's <strong>Personal Information</strong> from our records.  If for any reason we believe a user may be under the age of 13 we reserve the right to request proof of age of such user.  If such proof is not provided, or if it is discovered a user is under the age of 13 all <strong>Personal Information</strong> of that user shall be deleted from our servers and associated systems and we reserve the right to limit and/or ban such user from our Website.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, <strong>Cineplex </strong>may from time to time conduct, sponsor, co-sponsor or participate in contests and/or promotions which may be open to entrants of all ages, including children under the age of 13.  During such contests and/or promotions <strong>Cineplex </strong>makes special efforts to encourage children to consult with their parents before providing Personal Information and in each case parental consent must be obtained in order for any such entry or participation to be valid. <strong> Cineplex </strong>also believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools, available from online services and software manufacturers, to help provide a child-friendly online environment.  These tools may also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other <strong>Personal Information</strong> without parental permission.
