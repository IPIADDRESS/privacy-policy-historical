<p>
This Privacy Policy covers citymoments.cn's treatment of personal information that we gather when you are on the citymoments.cn website and when you use citymoments.cn services.
</p>
<p>
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that citymoments.cn does not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. What Personal Information About Users Does Citymoments.cn Collect?
</p>
<p>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website.
