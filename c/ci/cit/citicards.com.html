In addition, we gather information such as what browser and which version of it you're using, the type of operating system you have, and which site you came from.

		 <span id="nonpersonalInfoP2">When you browse our site or receive one of our emails, Citi and <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">companies we work with</a>, use <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> and/or <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">pixel tags</a> to collect information and store your online preferences. <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">Cookies</a> are widely used and most browsers are set up to accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to <a href="#anchor4 ">not accept cookies</a>.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="nonpersonalInfoP3">It's important to note that <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> and <a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">pixel tags</a> do not capture any information that can personally identify you.

		 <strong><span id="personalInfoP">Personal Information</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="personalInfoP1">In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you provide to us such as your name, address, phone number, and email. Collecting this personal information enables us to offer you online experiences that help you with your financial needs. For example, we collect personal information when you are:</span>

	        <li><span id="personalInfoL2">Applying for a new program or account</span></li>
	       </ul>
		 <span id="personalInfoP2">If you've enrolled in Citi services, such as online bill payment, we collect personal information about your transactions, and how you interact with third parties such as those you pay like a utility company or phone company. Collecting this information enables us to provide you these services. You can refer to the terms and conditions for your account or service to learn how your information is collected and used.</span><br><br>

		 <span id="personalInfoP4">The personal information you provide online is held by the Citi business that maintains your account or is processing your application for a new product or service.  You can access and/or change information in connection with your account or application by logging on to your account online or telephoning customer service.  </span><br><br>
		 <span id="personalInfoP5">Please see the <a href="#anchor5">Privacy Statement</a>, which we provide to all our customers, for a comprehensive explanation of how we collect, use and share personal information and what you can do to limit the use and sharing of your information. </span><br><br>

		 <strong><span id="useInfoP">2. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="useInfoP1">Citi uses the information we collect about and from you to manage our business and to offer an enhanced, personalized online experience on our site and <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">third-party websites</a>.</span><br><br>

	     <span id="adInfoP1"><a href="# " onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">Companies we work with</a> place and track advertisements on <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">third-party websites</a>. </span><br><br>
		 <span id="adInfoP2">Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers.  We place advertisements by developing and using our own <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">marketing segments</a> that may combine online and offline information about our current and prospective customers.  In addition, we may use <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">marketing segments</a> provided by online publishers and network advertising companies.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="adInfoP3">Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to <a href="#anchor4">avoid targeted advertising</a> provided by, or thru, them.</span><br><br>
		 
		 <a name="anchor4"></a>
		 <strong><span id="controlInfoP">4. Can You Control Your Information That's Collected and Used Online?</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="controlInfoP1">It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used online.</span><br><br>
		 <strong><span id="controlInfoP2">Cookies</span></strong><br><br>
		 <span id="controlInfoP3">You can control whether to accept <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> or not.  If you decide to not accept <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a>, some features and services on our site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Citi account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</span><br><br>
		 <span id="controlInfoP4">If you would prefer not to accept <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a>, you can: </span><br><br>
		   <ul>
	       	<li><span id="controlInfoL1">Change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookie</a>, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it</span></li>

	     <strong><span id="controlInfoP5">Targeted Advertising </span></strong><br><br>
	     <span id="controlInfoP6">If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information.  To do so please visit the <a href="/us/cards/opt_out.htm" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Page</a>. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.</span><br><br>
	     <span id="controlInfoP7">Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive.  The <a href="/us/cards/opt_out.htm" target="_blank">NAI Opt-Out Page</a> provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/us/cards/glossary_pop.htm','AddAccount','scrollbars,width=580,height=500')">cookies</a> on your browser and provides links to those companies. </span><br><br>
