         <a id="privacy" name="privacy"></a>Privacy statement
      </h2>
      <p>
         The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> defines personal information as
         'information or an opinion (including information or an opinion
         forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded
         in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is
         apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or
         opinion'.
      </p>
      <p>
         The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs
         (DIMIA) manages this website and treats personal information as
         confidential.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> is the key law designed to protect your
         rights and prevent misuse of personal information collected by
         government agencies such as this department.
      </p>
      <p>
         Also, information received by this department is protected from
         unauthorised use and disclosure by virtue of specific provisions in
         the <em>Migration Act 1958</em>, <em>Crimes Act 1914</em>, <em>Public
         Service Act 1999</em> and the <em>Public Service Regulations
         1999</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
         A breach of these laws may make an officer liable to criminal and/or
         civil penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
         As a general rule, we do not collect personal information about you
         when you visit this site. You can generally visit this site without
         telling us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.
      </p>
      <p>
         This website contains links to other sites. The immigration website is
         not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other
         websites and the department encourages you to read each site's privacy
         policies.
      </p>
      <h2>
         <a id="security" name="security"></a>Security of information
      </h2>
      <p>
         The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> has specific provisions that prohibit
         any officer of this department (or any other government department)
         from collecting, using or disclosing anyone's personal information
         except in performing their duties and in specific situations permitted
         by law.
      </p>
      <p>
         Your personal information will not be disclosed unless the law permits
         it or your permission is given.
      </p>
      <p>
         While the department provides a secure environment, you should be
         aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of
         information via the Internet.
