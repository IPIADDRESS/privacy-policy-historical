<li>gender;</li>
<li>login credentials;</li>

<em><a name="Information We Collect By Automated Means"></a>Information We Collect By Automated Means</em>

<p>In addition, when you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and web server logs.  The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Sites, and dates and times of visits to the Sites.  A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.  Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing the Sites.  As the visitor clicks through the Sites, a record of the action may be collected and stored.  We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you.  Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies.  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.  When you use the Sites, neither we nor any third parties collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites.  Our Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.</p>

<p>We may use third-party analytics services on the Sites, such as those of Google Analytics.  The information obtained for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" title="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Sites, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, Motivate is not responsible for these providers’ information practices.</p>
