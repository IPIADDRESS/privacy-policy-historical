<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The types of personal information we may collect include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone number);</li>
<li>date of birth;</li>
<li>gender;</li>
<li>login credentials;</li>

<li>your geographic location, in connection with your use of the Platform or the Service;</li>
<li>photographs, comments and other content you provide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your Mobile Application or device settings, we may collect your precise or approximate location information as determined through data such as GPS, mobile network, Bluetooth and WiFi. We may collect this location information when the Mobile Application is running in the foreground. We may also collect this information when the Mobile Application is running in the background of your device if this collection is enabled through your Mobile Application or device settings.</p>
<p>If you do not enable us to collect your location information, this may affect the functionality available on the Mobile Application.</p>
<p>In addition, when you use the Service, we may obtain trip data, including information such as your geographic location, trip duration, start and stop time and date, start and end station name, station ID number, station latitude and longitude, bicycle ID number and user type (such as annual member).</p>
<p><span id="automated"></span></p>
<h2 id="information-we-collect-by-automated-means">Information We Collect By Automated Means</h2>
<p>In addition, when you use the Platform, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, web server logs, and mobile SDKs. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics (such as hardware models, software, file names and versions, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, device motion information, and mobile network information), operating system and versions, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on the Platform, and dates and times of visits to the Platform. A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while using the Platform. As the visitor navigates through the Platform, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of the Platform. When you use the Platform, neither we nor any third parties collect personal information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites. The Platform is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.</p>
<p>We may use third-party analytics services on the Platform, such as those of Google Analytics. The information obtained for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><em>click here</em></a>.</p>
<p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on the Platform, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Motivate is not responsible for these providers’ information practices.</p>
