By using citiservi websites you consent to   the processing of your personal data by Google as described and for the purposes   mentioned above. </li><li><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use citiservi services, our servers   automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you   visit a website.

In some cases, we  process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may  process personal information to provide our own services.</p>  <p><strong>Personal  information</strong> <strong>choice</strong><br>When you sign up for a  particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal  information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose  for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such  use. <br>If we propose to use  personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy  and/or in the specific service notices, we will offer you an effective way to  opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will  not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those  described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have  obtained your prior consent. </p>  <p>You can decline to submit  personal information to any of our services, in which case citiservi may not be  able to provide those services to you. </p>  <p><strong>Sharing  of Information</strong> <br>citiservi only shares personal information with  individuals outside of citiservi if we have a good faith belief that access, use,  preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: </p>  <ul><li>satisfy  any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental  request,</li><li>enforce  applicable Terms of Use,  including investigation of potential violations thereof </li><li>detect,  prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or</li><li>protect  against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of citiservi, its users or  the public as required or permitted by law. </li>  </ul>  <p>If citiservi becomes involved  in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we  will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes  subject to a different privacy policy. </p>  <p>We may share with third  parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the  number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many  users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify  you individually. <br>Please contact us at the  address below for any additional questions about the management or use of  personal data. </p>  <p><strong>Securing  your information</strong> <br>We take appropriate  security measures to protect against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration,  disclosure or destruction of data.

These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject  to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to  meet these obligations. </p>  <p><strong>Accuracy  of Information</strong> <br>citiservi processes personal  information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance  with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.

We ask individual users to identify  themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before  processing such requests. We may decline to process requests that are  unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical  effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical  (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or  for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information  access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing  so would require a disproportionate effort. Individuals who wish to access  their personal data or have it corrected or removed may do by sending a request o such effect in  writing to <em>Plataforma de Gestión Publicitaria Citiservi S.L., Data Protection Department, Office 601, Avda Altos Hornos de Vizcaya 33, Edificio Ilgner, 48902 Barakaldo (Bizkaia), Spain</em>.
