<b>Citizens Bank Web Site Policy on Privacy</b>
<br><br>
Citizens Bank knows that our customers may share with us highly sensitive personal financial information.  We understand the need to keep such information secure.  As a result, we've developed the following policy so you'll know how we handle information we learn about you from your visit to our web site.
<br><br>
Anytime you visit, we may collect and store the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or uri.edu if you are connecting from the University of Rhode Island's domain); the date and time; the Internet address of the web site you left to visit us and the names of pages of our site you visit.
<br><br>
We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to different sections of our web site, and to help us make our site more useful.
<br><br>
If you submit an online application or send us E-mail:
<dir>
The application forms on the Citizens Bank web site use encryption to send your information across the Internet to us.  This is the case where confidential information, such as your account number or social security number is requested.  In some cases, we give you the option of sending the information to us in an unencrypted mode.  We will always inform you if we detect you are using a browser that does not support encryption.
<br><br>
If you send us e-mail, we may retain the content of the e-mail and your e-mail address in order to respond to questions or concerns that you may have expressed.
<br><br>
<b>E-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.  If your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as your account numbers, credit card number or social security number, you may want to call us or send it by regular mail instead.</b>
<br><br>
Citizens Bank <b>WILL NEVER</b> ask you for your Personal Identification Number (P.I.N.) for your Citizens Bank ATM card or Citizens Bank MasterMoney &amp; ATM card.  If you are asked for this information, please call 1-800-922-9999 and report it to a customer service agent immediately.

We want to be very clear:  We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 
<br><br>
For more information, call 1-800-922-9999.
