	<p class="subhead">Our Pledge Regarding the Responsible Use and Protection of Customer Information</p>
<p>Effective September 1, 2005</p>At Citizens Bank, one of our most important responsibilities to you, our 
customer, is the safekeeping of the nonpublic personal ("confidential") 
information you have entrusted to us and using this information in a 
responsible manner. Appropriate use of the confidential information you provide 
us is also at the heart of our ability to provide you with exceptional personal 
service whenever you contact us.
<br>
<br>
We are providing you with this important notice to inform you of how 
Citizens Bank uses and protects your confidential information. We encourage you 
to read and retain this notice, and to call or visit us if you have any 
questions. You do not have to respond to this notice in any way. By maintaining 
a customer relationship with us, you consent to our use of your confidential 
information in accordance with our pledge.
<br>
<br>
Citizens' pledge protects customers who have opened an account or 
obtained a financial service from us for personal, family or household 
purposes. This pledge also applies to former customers, and to consumers who 
have provided confidential information to us but have not entered into a 
customer relationship, for as long as information is retained. This pledge does 
not apply to business or commercial customers.
<br>
<br>
The following is our continuing commitment to the responsible use and 
protection of your confidential information-
<br>
<br>
<span class="subhead">Collection, Use and Retention of Confidential Information</span>
<br>
<br>
We limit the collection, use and retention of confidential information to what 
we believe is necessary to administer our business, to provide you with 
exceptional quality service, to comply with regulatory retention of information 
requirements, and to make available to you other accounts, services, and 
opportunities that may be of benefit or interest to you. For example, your 
information may be used to evaluate your eligibility for a loan or other 
service, to improve our accounts and services or the way we are able to deliver 
them to you, or to protect you from fraud.
<br>
<br>
Our online services use a feature of your Internet browser called a "cookie". 
Cookies are files that are placed in your computer's browser memory or placed 
on your hard drive. We may use cookies on our web site to verify your identity, 
remember personal settings including your preferences, to offer you additional 
options or enhance your online experience, and to improve our products and 
services. We also use them for marketing site personalization, and tracking of 
online applications and programs. Our server recognizes and records the domain 
name from which visitors to our site accessed the Internet and the names of the 
pages visited while at our site. It does not, however, collect and store your 
electronic mail address or other nonpublic personal information, unless you 
provide it to us. Finally, we also may use "cookies" to track the effectiveness 
of advertisements for Citizens Bank products and services, referred to as banner 
ads, that we may place on Citizens Bank and non-Citizens Bank web sites. Cookies 
used for tracking advertising effectiveness do not collect nonpublic personal, 
or confidential information.
<br>
<br>
The Citizens Bank web site may contain links to third party sites. Citizens Bank 
does not have access to the information you may provide to these third parties. 
You should review their privacy policy before you share any nonpublic personal 
information.
<br>
<br>
Citizens Bank respects the privacy of children (persons under the age of 13) 
online. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose any personally 
identifiable information from children. We do not knowingly market to children.
<br>
<br>
<span class="subhead">Information Collection</span>
<br>
<br>
We may collect information about you from the following sources-
<ul>
	<li>
		information we receive from you on applications, forms, or other information 
		that you provide to us-for example, your identification information, your 
		income, where you work, the accounts you have with other financial 
		institutions, the names of your beneficiaries on your insurance policy;
	</li>
	<li>
		information we obtain at your request-for example, your fax number, or 
		information that we need to complete a transaction that you authorized;
	</li>
	<li>
		information about your transactions and experiences with us-such as account 
		balances, the current value of your investments, account usage;
	</li>
	<li>
		information we receive from external sources, including from a consumer 
		reporting agency-such as your creditworthiness, your employment verification, 
		or your payment history; and
	</li>
	<li>
		information we receive from others, including public sources-for example, your 
		driving history from a state registry of motor vehicles for your automobile 
		insurance, real estate records, telephone numbers.
	</li>
</ul>
<span class="subhead">Our Protection of Confidential Information</span>
<br>
<br>
We will safeguard, according to prudent security standards, your confidential 
information. A fundamental element of safeguarding your confidential 
information is to provide protection against unauthorized access or use of this 
information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that 
comply with federal guidelines to guard your confidential information against 
unauthorized access or use. Our employees are limited in the access they have 
to information about you to what is reasonably necessary to complete their 
responsibilities, to maintain your accounts, to complete a transaction that you 
authorized, to notify you of new products and services, or otherwise meet your 
needs. They are subject to a corporate code of ethics and other policies that 
require maintaining the confidentiality of customer information.
<br>
<br>
Citizens Bank will continue to enhance and maintain prudent security standards 
and procedures to protect against unauthorized access or use of your 
confidential information and records. These security procedures also protect 
former customers and consumers who have applied for an account or service at 
Citizens Bank for as long as the information is retained.
<br>
<br>
Citizens Bank encourages you to help us protect your information and to keep your 
information accurate. Please do not disclose your social security number, your 
account numbers, your access codes, or personal identification number (PIN) to 
your accounts to anyone with whom you are not familiar or would not trust with 
this information. We also ask that you review your statements promptly. If you 
suspect someone has made unauthorized transactions on your Citizens Bank 
accounts, or if you believe that any information about you is not accurate, 
please call us anytime at <nobr>1-877-229-6430</nobr> (New England customers) 
or <nobr>1-800-255-6522</nobr> (PA, NJ, NY or DE customers).
<br>
<br>
<span class="subhead">Sharing Information within our Family of Companies</span>
<br>
<br>
We will not share any information about you within our corporate family, except 
as required or permitted by law or as expressly authorized by you and then in 
accordance with prudent security procedures. Specifically, we may share with 
the Citizens Bank family of companies:
<br>
<br>
information that relates to our experiences or transactions with you or your 
accounts, such as account balances, payment history and account usage;
<br>
<br>
information that facilitates our proper identification of you when we share 
information about you or to protect against fraud, such as your name and 
address; and
<br>
<br>
information we receive from you on applications and other forms or from third 
parties, such as your income, credit references and credit history, only:
<br>
<br>
- if the application or form discloses that we will share it, and we either 
give you an opportunity to tell us not to share this information or you 
expressly authorize us to do so, or
<br>
<br>
- as otherwise permitted by applicable law (such as to make credit decisions, 
service your account, process transactions that you request or prepare 
statements).
<br>
<br>
If you have given confidential medical information to us, such as for an 
insurance application or for other permissible reasons, we will not share your 
confidential medical information either within or outside the Citizens Bank family 
of companies except in a manner disclosed to you when the information was 
collected, or to which you have agreed.
<br>
<br>
Certain information, such as trust and fiduciary information, is subject to 
additional limitations regarding the sharing of information, both within the 
Citizens Bank family of companies and externally.
<br>
<br>
<span class="subhead">Sharing Information with Third Parties Outside our Family of 
	Companies</span>
<br>
<br>
We will not share your confidential information with any company or third party 
outside our family of companies except as required or permitted by law. This 
means, for example, that we can disclose your confidential information:
<ul>
	<li>
		to third parties that help us provide products or services to you, such as 
		companies that print your checks, data processors that work for Citizens Bank, mail 
		companies, or software vendors;
	</li>
	<li>
		to third parties that assist us in marketing accounts and services;
	</li>
	<li>
		to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements 
		to enhance our financial product or service offerings;
	</li>
	<li>
		to insurance companies that underwrite insurance we arrange for our customers;
	</li>
	<li>
		to investors or other financial institutions that purchase loans from us;
	</li>
	<li>
		to consumer reporting agencies;
	</li>
	<li>
		to third parties that process or service a financial product, service or 
		transaction that you requested or authorized;
	</li>
	<li>
		to respond to a subpoena, court order or judicial process;
	</li>
	<li>
		to pursue a sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or 
		operating unit;
	</li>
	<li>
		to our regulators and auditors;
	</li>
	<li>
		to protect against or prevent fraud, manage risk, or resolve customer disputes; 
		or,
	</li>
	<li>
		to a third party to whom you specifically authorize us to share the 
		information.
	</li>
</ul>
Whenever other companies or third parties provide services for us or on our 
behalf, we require them by contract to maintain the appropriate safeguards to 
ensure the security and the confidentiality of the information that we provide 
them.
<br>
<br>
Because certain disclosures of confidential information are specifically 
required or permitted by law, we can make these disclosures even if you prefer 
we do not do so. Therefore, you do not have to respond to this notice in any 
way.
<br>
<br>
<span class="subhead">SPECIAL NOTICE TO VERMONT AND CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS:</span>

If you have a Vermont or California mailing address, we will automatically

Citizens Bank family of companies to what is permitted by applicable law or 
regulation. You do not have to respond to this notice in any way.
