<b>Citizens Bank Web Site Policy on Privacy</b>
<br><br>
Citizens Bank knows that our customers may share with us highly sensitive personal financial information.  We understand the need to keep such information secure.  As a result, we've developed the following policy so you'll know how we handle information we learn about you from your visit to our web site.
<br><br>
Anytime you visit, we may collect and store the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or uri.edu if you are connecting from the University of Rhode Island's domain); the date and time; the Internet address of the web site you left to visit us and the names of pages of our site you visit.
<br><br>
We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to different sections of our web site, and to help us make our site more useful.
<br><br>
If you submit an online application or send us E-mail:
<dir>
The application forms on the Citizens Bank web site use encryption to send your information across the Internet to us.  This is the case where confidential information, such as your account number or social security number is requested.  In some cases, we give you the option of sending the information to us in an unencrypted mode.  We will always inform you if we detect you are using a browser that does not support encryption.
<br><br>
If you send us e-mail, we may retain the content of the e-mail and your e-mail address in order to respond to questions or concerns that you may have expressed.
<br><br>
<b>E-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.  If your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as your account numbers, credit card number or social security number, you may want to call us or send it by regular mail instead.</b>
<br><br>
Citizens Bank <b>WILL NEVER</b> ask you for your Personal Identification Number (P.I.N.) for your Citizens Bank ATM card or Citizens Bank MasterMoney &amp; ATM card.  If you are asked for this information, please call 1-800-922-9999 and report it to a customer service agent immediately.

</dir>

We want to be very clear:  We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 
<br><br>
For more information, call 1-800-922-9999.

				<p> <b>Protecting Your Privacy</b><br> At Citizens Bank we know
				  that our customers may share highly sensitive personal and financial
				  information with us. We understand the need to keep such information secure. As
				  a result, we've developed the following policy so you'll know how we handle
				  information we learn about you from your visit to our web site. </p> 
				<p> <b>When Information is Collected And Not Collected</b><br>
				  Anytime you visit, we may collect and store the name of the domain from which
				  you access the Internet (for example aol.com, if you are connecting from an
				  America Online account, or uri.edu if you are connecting from the University of
				  Rhode Island's domain); the date and time; the Internet address of the web site
				  you left to visit us and the names of the pages you visit on our site. We use
				  the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to different
				  sections of our web site, and to help us make our site more useful. </p> 
				<p> Some areas of our Web site require information, such as your
				  e-mail address or phone number, to enable you to correspond with us. In these
				  cases, we collect your information necessary to interact with you. If you do
				  not interact with us, any personal information, such as your e-mail address, is
				  not collected. </p> 
				<p> <b>Protecting Your Online Applications Or Enrollment Forms
				  </b><br> The application or enrollment forms on the Citizens Bank Web site use
				  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to transfer your information across the
				  Internet to us. This technology encrypts - or scrambles - the information you
				  provide so it's virtually impossible for anyone other than Citizens Bank to
				  read it. We use this technology whenever confidential information, such as your
				  account number or social security number is requested. However, in some cases
				  we give you the option of sending information to us in an unencrypted mode. We
				  will always inform you if we detect you are using a browser that does not
				  support encryption. </p> 
				<p> <b>How We Handle E-Mail</b><br> If you send us e-mail, we may
				  retain the content of the e-mail and your e-mail address in order to respond to
				  questions or concerns that you may have. </p> 
				<p><b> E-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If
				  your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as
				  your account numbers, credit card number or social security number, you may
				  want to call us or send it through the U.S. Post Office instead. </b></p> 
				<p> To help ensure secure transmissions, your e-mails to us should
				  be sent using the Citizens Bank Online "Talk To Us" page. Inquiries sent
				  through our "Talk To Us" page is secure and use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
				  technology. Since we can not ensure our response back to you is secure, we will
				  not include confidential account information in the response.
