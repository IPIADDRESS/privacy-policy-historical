<b>Cookies</b></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
cookie
is
a
small
data
file
that
certain
Web
sites
write
to
your
hard
drive
when
you
visit
them.
A
cookie
file
can
contain
information
such
as
a
user
ID
that
the
site
uses
to
track
the
pages
you've
visited.
But
the
only
personal
information
a
cookie
can
contain
is
information
you
supply
yourself.
Generally,
cookies
work
by
assigning
a
unique
number
to
the
user
that
has
no
meaning
outside
the
assigning
site.
A
cookie
can't
read
data
off
your
hard

or
read
cookie

created

This
random
number
lets
us
keep
track
of
"how
many"
times
customers
are
doing
specific
things-
like
visiting
our
site
each
month
-
without
really
knowing
who
those
customers
are.
We
also
use
cookies
to
keep
track
of
your

to
make
sure
you
don't
see
the
same

repeatedly.
We
use
cookies
to
deliver

specific

Additionally,
after
you've
entered
your

ID

during
a
session
on
our

we
save
that
information
so
you
don't

there
may
