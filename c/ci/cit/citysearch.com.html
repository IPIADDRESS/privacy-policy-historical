		<font face="arial" size="3">At CitySearch, we understand your need for privacy when using the Internet for your communication, shopping, exploration and play.  These are the Policies CitySearch.com adheres to in maintaining this site for your use.  Please note that each particular web site under the Ticketmaster Online - CitySearch, Inc. network (including
		<a href="http://www.citysearch.com">www.citysearch.com</a>,
		<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">www.ticketmaster.com</a>,
		<a href="http://www.match.com">www.match.com</a> and <a href="http://www.cityauction.com">www.cityauction.com</a>) may have particular privacy policies that apply only to that web site.  Therefore, you should refer to those individual web sites for their unique privacy policies.</font><p>
		__________________________________________________________________</p><p>
		<font face="arial" size="4"><b><a name="back" top="top" to="to">Privacy Policies</a></b></font></p><p>
		<font face="arial" size="3">
		<b>Policy 1.</b>
		We will explicitly ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("Personal Information").  Generally, Personal Information is requested when you register for a site, when you request a particular service or information from us or one of our merchants, when you purchase a product, when you fill out a survey, or when you enter a sweepstakes or contest.  When possible, we will give you a chance to make sure that your Personal Information is correct and up to date.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b>Policy 2.</b>
		We have important business relationships with certain third party service partners ("Service Partners").  These Service Partners allow us to offer you a broader array of services than we could provide to you on our own and assist us in the operation of our site.  Our Service Partners and we use your Personal Information to operate the site and services that we offer, and to inform you of new features, services, and products available to you.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b>Policy 3.</b>
		We may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site's service but are not necessary to its operation ("Other Companies' Use"). If we intend to use your Personal Information for Other Companies' Use we will provide you with instructions on how to decline giving your Personal Information. You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from us, or from other companies referred by us, by following the instructions on the email delivering the information.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b>Policy 4.</b>
		We do not believe that any portion of our site directly solicits children 13 years old or younger.  However, if we develop a portion of our site that does directly solicit children age 13 years old or younger, we will not directly solicit Personal Information from children, nor provide it for Other Companies' Use without first attempting to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian.  If possible, we will also endeavor to provide e-mail notice to parents that their children have provided Personal Information to the site.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b>Policy 5.</b>
		We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users, or (c) act immediately to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b>Policy 6.</b>
		If at any time you believe that we have violated these Policies, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacyinfo@citysearch.com">privacyinfo@citysearch.com</a> and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly investigate and remedy the problem.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b><a name="How do you collect Personal Information">How do you collect Personal Information?</a></b><br>
		Personal Information is collected by specifically requesting it from you.  Generally this occurs when you register at a site, request a service or information, fill out a survey, purchase a product, or enter an online contest or sweepstakes.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">
		
		<b><a name="What about Cookies">What about Cookies?</a></b><br>
		Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site.  The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers.  Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies.  However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site's functionality if you do so.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3"> 
		
		<b><a name="How do you use Personal Information">How do you use Personal Information?</a></b><br>
		Usually, we use your Personal Information to operate the site and to deliver services.  Personal Information may be shared between web sites that make up the Ticketmaster Online - CitySearch, inc. network of web sites and which currently include
		<a href="http://www.citysearch.com">www.citysearch.com</a>,
		<a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com">www.ticketmaster.com</a>,
		<a href="http://www.match.com">www.match.com</a> and
		<a href="http://www.cityauction.com">www.cityauction.com</a>. We may also use Personal Information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. If we intend to use Personal Information for Secondary Uses (see below), you will be provided with an opportunity to decline such contact.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b><a name="Do you share my Personal Information with other companies">Do you share my Personal Information with other companies?</a></b><br>
		We may have several necessary service partners who assist in providing the services or products associated with the site.  As part of the operation of the site, these companies may have access to your Personal Information.  These companies may provide routine services, such as credit card processing, or may provide essential elements of the site. These uses of Personal Information are primary to the operation of the site and are not considered Secondary Uses.  We may also partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers.  This type of use of Personal Information is called a "Secondary Use" because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site.  For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products.  In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to our users.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b><a name="What about the privacy of children">What about the privacy of children?</a></b><br>
		The safety and privacy of children under 18 on the Internet is essential.  We do not believe that any portion of our site is primarily directed at children.  If we develop an area of our web site that is primarily directed at children, particularly children 13 years old or younger, we will only collect the most minimal amount of Personal Information necessary for the operation of the service.  We will attempt to follow up our collection of Personal Information from children with a message to the user's e-mail address instructing them to seek parental permission for their use of the site.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b><a name="Do you collect other forms of information about your users">Do you collect other forms of information about your users?</a></b><br>
		In addition to the use of Personal Information to operate our site, we may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by us or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.  For example, we might use this anonymous information to inform our advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can measure whether the advertisement was effective.  This information is also used to generate advertising rates.  Generally this information is collected either through "traffic data" or direct surveys of our customers and may entail the use of "Cookies", "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer by which a user accesses our site.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b><a name="How do I correct or change Personal Information that I have given to you">How do I correct or change Personal Information that I have given to you?</a></b><br>
		Generally, you will have the opportunity to correct or change your Personal Information at any time.  When you use the Web site feature for which you have provided Personal Information, you will be able to access and edit your Personal Information for that feature.  For example, when you register to personalize CitySearch content, you are asked to provide us with a password.  You can change that password at any time from your personalized My CitySearch page.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">

		<b><a name="Can other users obtain my Personal Information from the Site without my consent">Can other users obtain my Personal Information from the Site without my consent?</a></b><br>
		Personal Information collected by us is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. In many instances, such as in the case of credit card numbers, the Personal Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction.</font></p><p>
