For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy"link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p><h2>How you can access your information</h2><p>If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by <a href="http://national.citysearch.com/saved/my_citysearch/?">logging into your account</a>. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.</p><h2 id="your_choices">Your choices about collection and use of your information</h2><ul>    <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented to you; register as a member or user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</li>    <li>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by logging in with your account information, clicking on the "My Citysearch" link, then clicking on the "My Newsletters" link and selecting those portions of your communication settings you would like to update.

It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. <i>Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</i></li></ul><h2 id="security">How we protect your personal information</h2><p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p><p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p><h2>Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms</h2><p>We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, as well as post reviews of businesses, products, establishments, contractors, and the like, or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our <a href="http://national.citysearch.com/saved/html/my_citysearch/terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.</p><h2>Children's privacy</h2><p>Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p><h2>Visiting our websites from outside the United States</h2><p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p><h2>No Rights of Third Parties</h2><p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</p><h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p><h2>How to contact us</h2><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail as follows:</p><p>	<a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.coolsavings.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"></a>Privacy Officer<br>	Citysearch.com<br>	8833 Sunset Blvd.<br>	West Hollywood, CA 90069<br>	<a href="mailto:legal@citysearch.com">legal@citysearch.com</a></p><h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2><p>If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information with third parties and the IAC companies for their direct marketing purposes.
