    <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>The following Privacy  Policy summarizes the various ways that Advameg, Inc. (“Service Provider,” “we”  or “our”) collects and uses the personally identifiable information garnered  through our website, www.city-data.com (“Website”). It is our goal to bring you  information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time,  protect your privacy.</p>
    <h2><strong>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THE WEBSITE COLLECTS</strong></h2>
    <p>Personally identifiable  information is collected by the Website with your specific knowledge and  consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, register for  our forum or business profile, you maybe be asked to provide information such  as your e-mail address, name, or phone number. Optional information such as  your age or gender may also be requested. By submitting such web form contained  on this Website, you agree to the processing and storage of your information by  the Service Provider.</p>
    <p>If you contact us by email  through the Website, we reserve the right to also keep a record of the email  itself and any personally identifiable information provided in that email and  any others that result, in order to respond to them and for any other purpose  described in this Policy.</p>
    <p>Our servers may also  automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the  Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the  operating system you are running, date and time of the visit, the website that  referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address  is usually associated with your Internet Service Provider, your company or your  university, and may identify your physical location.</p>
    <h2><strong>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>
    <p>We generally do not disclose your  personally identifiable information to third parties. However, we reserve the  right to disclose this information if we reasonably believe it is needed for  any of the following reasons:<br>
1. Pursuant to a subpoena or  other governmental request<br>
2. For any other reason required  by law<br>
3. In order to protect our  employees, independent contractors, affiliates, the users of this Website or  the public at large and their property, rights and safety<br>
4. To enforce any terms of  service on this Website<br>
5. To provide you with the  services or products requested by you</p>
    <p>Your personally identifiable  information may also be disclosed, without limitation, if the Service Provider  is acquired or in the event of any sale or transfer of assets of the Service  Provider.</p>
    <p>We use the personally  identifiable information that we receive to contact you about your requests to  us. We may also, from time to time, send you information that we feel that you  might be interested in. </p>
    <p>We will use your information only  as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not personally  identify you) may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine  information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from  other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most  attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our  advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you  individually.</p>
    <h2><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong></h2>
    <p>Website may use  "cookies," Flash objects or similar electronic tools to collect  information, such as the IP address of your computer, to enhance and customize  your experience with this Website. A cookie is a small text file that is placed  on your computer and which collects information about your use of this Website,  such as the Web pages visited, the date and the time of a visit, the Web sites  you visited immediately before, etc. Cookies may be stored on the user's hard  drive for an extended period of time. Cookies served by our Website do not  gather demographic information about our users. Cookies may also be used to  provide our advertisers with targeted advertising opportunities, and  advertising vendors that serve ads on our Website may also use their own  cookies. You may choose not to accept any cookies from any party by changing  the settings on your browser. However, if you set your browser to refuse  cookies, some portions of our Website may not function properly.</p>
    <h2><strong>SURVEYS AND CONTESTS</strong></h2>
     From time-to-time, our  Website requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation  in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has  a choice whether or not to disclose any information.
<h2><strong>HOW THE WEBSITE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</strong></h2>
     <p>We may use personally identifying  information you supply through the Website to provide you with the service you  have requested. For example, if you subscribe to our forum, we may use your  e-mail address to send you periodic e-mails. Similarly, if you enter an online  sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. If  you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail,  simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail.</p>
     <p>We also allow access to our  database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical  maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and  to the extent necessary to provide those services. We reserve the right to use  the information we collect about your computer, which may at times contain  sufficient information for us to be able to identify you, for any lawful  business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with  our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise  administer our Website. </p>
     <p>We reserve the right to use,  transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group  for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible  advertisers and partners. </p>
     <p>As our business changes, we may  buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned  or controlled by the Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or  affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another  company, the information from and/or about our Website users may be among the transferred  assets. </p>
    <h2><strong>AFFILIATED SITES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS</strong></h2>
    <p>We expect our partners,  advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.  However, third parties, including our business partners, advertisers,  affiliates and other content providers accessible through our Website, may have  their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example,  during your visits to our Website you may link to, or view as part of a frame  on a Website page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a  third party. Also, through a page on the Website you may be introduced to, or  be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests  or sweepstakes offered by other parties. We are not responsible for the actions  or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy  policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page  operated by a third party.</p>
    <p>While on our Website, our  advertisers, business partners or other third parties may use cookies or other  technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve  information about you. For example, some of our advertising may be served by  third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine  whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features  available on our Website, third parties may use cookies or other technology to  gather information. We do not control the use of this technology or the  resulting information and are not responsible for any actions or policies of  such third parties.</p>

If we discover we have received any information from a  child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information  immediately. </p>
    <h2><strong>SECURITY</strong></h2>
    <p>Because no data  transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical  or electronic security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the  security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or  databases, and by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection  with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website. We  take precautions to protect your personally identifiable information but no  computer system is completely secure. Due to this, we cannot guarantee the  safety of your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your  information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek  to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail  (provided we have your e-mail address). </p>
    <h2>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to  change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for  changes. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to  these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to  the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that  applied at the time the information was collected.</p>
    <h2><strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong></h2>
    <p>This policy and the use of this  Website are governed by Illinois law. The exclusive jurisdiction for any claim,  dispute, or litigation (“Litigation”) arising out of the operation of the  Website or this policy shall be vested in the federal and state courts located  in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, and such courts shall have exclusive  jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of any such Litigation.

If you are located outside the United  States, please note the information you provide to us will be transferred to  the United States. You hereby consent to this transfer.</p>
