		<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
			<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) 
			will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. If, however, you activate the Anonymize IP option on this website, Google will remove the end of your IP address so it only locates you as within the member states of the European Union or other members of the European Economic Area.
			Only in rare cases will the complete IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and then shortened there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.
			The operator of this website will use information gathered via interest-related advertising as well as third-party visitor data (e.g. age, gender and interests) for the purpose of evaluation in order to find out more about the users of this website. No person-related data shall be used here; only a statistical evaluation of anonymous data sets shall be carried out.
			Google will not associate your IP address as transmitted by Google Analytics with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. 
			Furthermore, you can prohibit Google from collecting and analyzing the data generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. 
			Should you wish to adapt or prevent the analysis of your demographic or interest-based information, you can disable Google Analytics display ads and adapt the ads in the Google Display Network: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Social Media Plugins</h2>
			<p>Facebook</p>
			<p>Embedded on our website are various Facebook links. This web presence is operated exclusively by Facebook Inc., 1601 S California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (Facebook).</p>
			<p>Within the scope of our web presence, these links are identified by the Facebook logo or by various facebook pluggins.</p>
			<p>Should a user click one of these links, then the Facebook plugins are activated and establish a direct connection via the user’s browser to a Facebook server.</p>
			<p>Provided that the user clicks one of the aforementioned links while visiting our website, and is logged into their personal Facebook account, the information will be forwarded to Facebook that the user has visited our website. Facebook can associate your visit to the website to your account.</p>
			<p>This data is transferred to and saved by Facebook. To prevent this, the user must log out of their account before clicking the link. The functions embedded in the links by Facebook, especially the transfer of data and user information, are not activated by visiting our website, but rather by clicking the corresponding links.</p>
			<p>The purpose and scope of data collection via Facebook, the processing and use of such data, as well as your rights thereof and personal settings regarding privacy protection can be found in the Facebook privacy settings section (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>).</p>
			<p>For further questions pertaining to the collection, processing or use of individual user data, as well as regarding disclosing, correcting, blocking or deleting data, please contact our data protection supervisors.</p>
			<p>Google Plus</p>
			<p>Our web presence also employs the Google Plus “+1” link, which is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (Google). The link can be identified by the “+1” symbol against a white or color background.</p>
			<p>If the user opens one of our websites containing such a link, the user’s browser establishes a direct connection to a Google server. The contents of the “+1” link are transferred directly to your browser, which then integrates said content in the webpage. We therefore have no control over the data whatsoever that Google collects via the link, but would expect user IP addresses to be collected.</p>
			<p>The purpose and scope of data collection via Google, the processing and use of such data, as well as your rights thereof and personal settings regarding privacy protection can be found in the Google privacy settings section <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/+/policy/+1button.html">http://www.google.com/intl/de/+/policy/+1button.html</a><br>
			If a user is a Google Plus member and does not wish to have their data collected and linked to their saved Google member data via our web presence, the the user must log out of their Google Plus account before visiting our websites.</p>
		
		<h2>Right of revocation, deletion of data</h2>
			<p>If you have given us consent to process personal data, you can withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
			<p>cannonsatoshi deletes your personal data insofar as it is no longer needed or required, or if you have requested the deletion of this data. Please note that data cannot be deleted if there are legal storage requirements or this data is required by us for the billing of our services.</p>
		<h2>Information, viewing, and deletion of data</h2>
			<p>At <a href="https://cannonsatoshi.com/contact/">https://cannonsatoshi.com/contact/</a>, you can request to see data which we have recorded, as well as request to have this data changed or deleted.</p>
			<p>Should you have any questions about cannonsatoshi’s Data Privacy Policy and data protection in general, please do not hesitate to contact us at support@cannonsatoshi.com.<br>
			Please remember to provide your user ID, e-mail address and, if necessary, the relevant game name(s).</p>
