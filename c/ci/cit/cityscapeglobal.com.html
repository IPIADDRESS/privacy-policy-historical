   	    <p><strong>Use of Cookies and other tracking technologies</strong></p>
   	    <p>Our website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes including cookies. A cookie is a small text file written to a user's hard drive that contains the User ID. The cookies record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. The use of cookies and tracking technologies is now widespread by sites in order to track traffic flows. We use cookies and other tracking technologies to enable us to offer certain time-saving features to our users such as, one-time log in, global-site shopping cart functionality and pre-populating name and address fields. If a user sets up his browser to reject the cookie or tracking technology, he or she may still use the site although functionality will be impaired.

   	    <p>We may combine your visitor session information or other information collected through tracking technologies with personally identifiable information in order to understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest to you.</p>
   	    <p>We also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send to our visitors for a number of purposes including: to determine whether our visitors have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails; to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after a visitor has closed an email; and to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular email.</p>
   	    <p>Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on our behalf.

   	    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
   	    <p>This website takes every precaution to protect and maintain the security of your information. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>

   	    <p>This site contains links to other websites. Their inclusion cannot be taken to imply any endorsement or validation by us of the content of the said website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices nor do we accept any liability in connection with the content of such websites. We may use third party advertisements on our site. Cookies may be associated with these advertisements to enable the advertiser to track the number of anonymous users responding to the campaign. We do not have access to or control of cookies placed by third parties.</p>

   	    <p>In the event that the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaserâ€™s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business.</p>
   	    <p><strong>Changes/Updates to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
