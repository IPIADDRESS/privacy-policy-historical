<h3>What information does Cityfos receive and how do we use it? </h3>
<p>When you register for Cityfos, we ask you for your name, contact information, and basic company information.
These information lets us provide you personalized services and communicate separately with you. 
We also use aggregated information about the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences and improve our programming. 
Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. 
Cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself.

<h3>What kind of security is used to protect my information?</h3>
<p>We store all user information in secure databases protected by a variety of access controls. 
Access to this data is limited to a minimum number of employees and this data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement. </p>

<h3>Who has access to my information?</h3>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies (apart from those acting as our agents in providing our Service to you, who agree to use it only for that purpose), 
except when it is necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested or you otherwise give us permission to do so. 
Cityfos may also share such information in response to the legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. </p>

<h3>What about other companies featured on Cityfos?</h3>
<p>You may separately agree to provide your information to other companies who provide content for various parts of our Service, 
in order to use their services or receive offers from them.
