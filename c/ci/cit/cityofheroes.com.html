            <p>“Personal Information”  is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including,  for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.  Personal Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself,  does not permit the identification of individual persons (like statistics about  how many persons visited our web site last month, or how many visitors are male  and how many are female).<br>
              This Privacy  Policy is a condition of acceptance on the Sites and their respective services,  including, without limitation, the services NCI performs on behalf of its  affiliates; by using the Sites and these services, you agree to be  bound by this policy’s terms and conditions. This Privacy Policy only addresses  activities from our servers. Other sites (including those to which we may link)  and other service providers may have their own policies, which we do not  control, and thus are not addressed or controlled by this policy.</p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li><a name="personal" id="personal"></a>Collection of Personal Information</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
              <p>You  provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) register to use the  services, (b) register for contests or giveaways, (c) complete questionnaires,  (d) order products and services from us, and (e) send email messages, submit  forms or send other information to us.</p>
              <p>Use of  Email Address:<br>
                Your  email address will be used to contact you regarding specific issues related to  your active account(s). You may also receive special notices and offers for  products and services offered by NCS. You will be given the opportunity to “opt  out” of any mailings which do not include critical information regarding your  active game account(s). Please see “Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions, and  Related Third Party Services” below for specific information on how your Personal  Information may be used by third parties in those special cases.</p>
              <p>Payment Method:<br>
                You will also be  asked to submit Personal Information depending on the payment method you choose  when subscribed to one of our services. For example, if you choose to pay for NCI  services by credit card, you will be required to provide us the name of your  credit card issuer, credit card number, billing address, CVV number, and  expiration date. If you choose to pay for NCI services and/or the services NCI  performs on behalf of its affiliates by using, without limitation,  check, PayPal, SMS, paysafecard, Game Time Cards, or  ELV, you will be required to provide us with applicable Personal Information in  order to permit us to process such payment.</p>
              <p>Non-personal  Information:<br>
                In addition to the  login information, we will automatically collect certain non-personal  information about your use of our Sites and services. We might collect, among  other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer  operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service  provider, your “click path” through the Sites, and the web site or  advertisement that was linked to or from the Sites when you visited. To do  this, we may use cookies and other technology (see below). Your visits to our  Sites, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous  unless you provide us with personal information or have provided such  information in the past. For example, if you’ve created a membership account, your  account information (including name, email address, and billing and shipping  information) may be linked to the items you purchased at our online store  (i.e., purchase order history).This information is only used for our internal  purposes (such as to improve the Site or to customize content). </p>
              <p>Cookies  and Related Technologies:<br>
                We use a feature  of your browser called a “cookie” to assign a unique number that automatically  identifies your computer when you visit the site. A cookie is a piece of  text-only data stored on your hard drive. By setting a cookie on our site, you  would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while  on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site. The only  drawback to this is that you will be limited in some areas of our site, or may  have to enter passwords or identifying information more than once.<br>
                Sweepstakes, Contests and  Promotions, and Related Third Party</p>
              <p>Services:<br>
                To participate in  some of our sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions, you may be  asked to provide additional personal information such as your mailing address.  In each such case, no new personal information will be collected from you  without your consent. This information may be collected by NCI or by third parties  such as co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion. Our use of any such  information will be governed by this Privacy Policy. The names of third parties  such as co-sponsors (other than vendors hired by NCI to conduct, administer,  and execute a promotion on behalf of NCI) will be disclosed to you when you are  asked to sign up for the promotion. You should review such third parties’  privacy policies to see how they may use any information that they collect.</p>
              <p>Certain NCI services,  sweepstakes and/or contests, may be provided to you in conjunction with a third  party, such as with Alienware. During the registration process for any such  sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions or service(s) related to  such games, you may be notified that such third party wishes access to some of  your Personal Information. In such a situation, you will be given an  opportunity to decline to share that information with that third party before  any such information is shared. If you decline to share such information with the  relevant third party, you may not be able to participate use and/or is such  sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions or service(s) for that  game. As described in the registration process, a third party’s (such as  Alienware’s) use of the shared Personal Information will be governed by any  privacy policy that company may have in place and our use of such information  shall, of course, be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You may  change your preferences concerning the sharing of your information by going to  the [INSERT NAME/LINK TO APPROPRIATE PAGE] page.</p>
              <p>Online  Communications, Games:<br>
                When you play any  of the games offered and/or served by NCI, or use any of the communication  features on the Sites, your IP address (the Internet protocol address from  which you access any of the above) may be stored in our records. When any game  is updated or “patched,” our patch routine may check your computer to see that  you have the most recent version of game-specific files; when you communicate within  any game or any other communication feature within any of our Sites (e.g. live  chat, instant message services and the like), even “privately” to another  person, you do so with the understanding that those communications go through  our servers, can be monitored by us, you have no expectation of privacy in any  of those communications and, accordingly, you expressly consent to monitoring  of communications (including technical support and customer service  communications) that you send and receive. When you log into one of our online  games, your system specifications (such as OS, RAM, video card, monitor, system  configuration, etc.) may be reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of  analyzing and optimizing your game experience and in order to provide you with  customer service.</p>
              <p>In-Game Advertising:<br>
Our games may incorporate dynamic advertisement serving technology offered by Double Fusion (“Ad Providers”), which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the game on your PC or console, and replaced while you play online. Ad Providers only log information that is needed to measure presentation of, and serve advertising to the appropriate geographic region, and to the right location within the game. Logged data may include Internet Protocol Address or player’s user name, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisements, and angle of view. Your game may be assigned an id number, which is stored on your PC or console, and used by Ad Providers to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic in game advertising. The id number is not associated with any personal data. No logged information is used to personally identify you. The servers used by the Ad Providers may be located outside your country of residence.&nbsp; If you reside in a Member  State of the European Union, the servers may be located outside of the European Union.&nbsp; This ad serving technology is integrated into the game; if you do not want to use this technology, do not play the game while connected to the Internet.&nbsp; For more information concerning Double Fusion, please visit <a href="http://www.doublefusion.com/" target="_blank">http://www.doublefusion.com/</a>.&nbsp; </p>

              <p>Personal  information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and  used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some  other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy.
