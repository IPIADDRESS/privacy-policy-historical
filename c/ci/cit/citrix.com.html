        <h2>Citrix Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><b><span class="size2">Information Collection</span></b><span class="size2"><br>
          Citrix deems privacy a central issue of Internet use. Citrix attempts 
          to have reasonable policy measures in place to assure the anonymity 
          of visitors to the Citrix web site. Citrix feels as part of responsible 
          disclosure that Citrix web site users are aware of what information 
          is being logged. </span></p>
        <p class="size2">To maintain and improve site quality and integrity, IP 
          addresses are logged (the Internet Protocol addresses of computers). 
          This log is a standard method of reporting to statistically find out 
          which parts of our web site are visited and how long visitors spend 
          there. We also log the type of browser and operating system you are 
          using. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p class="size2">Like many other commercial web sites, the Citrix web 
          site may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect 
          information about how you use the site. Cookies were originally designed 
          to help a web site distinguish a user's browser as a previous visitor 
          and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while 
          the user was browsing the site. A cookie is a small string of text that 
          a web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other 
          data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your 
          e-mail address. Currently, web sites use cookies to enhance the user's 
          visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, 
          personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited 
          or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart." It is possible 
          to set your browser to inform you when a cookie is being placed -- this 
          way, you have the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. 
        </p>
        <p class="size2">At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us 
          with personal information, such as your e-mail address, for purposes 
          such as corresponding with us, registering at a site, making a purchase, 
          entering a sweepstakes, registering a new product, or participating 
          in an online survey. </p>
        <p class="size2"><b>Information Use</b><br>
          When you supply Citrix with your personal information, we may use the 
          information to to learn more about you so that we can develop better 
          products and services or use the information, sharing it with our business 
          partners, to inform you about new products, services and offers that 
          may be of interest to you. </p>
        <p class="size2"><b>Declining E-mail Offers</b><br>
          Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of 
          these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with 
          choices. At any time after receiving an e-mail offer from Citrix, you 
          may request to discontinue receiving these offers. All e-mail offers 
          that you receive from Citrix will tell you how to decline further e-mail 
          offers. Our partners may have different policies. </p>
        <p class="size2"><b>Children</b><br>
          While Citrix's product ad campaigns and marketing materials may be viewed 
          by children, we do not wish to receive data from children. Citrix encourages 
          parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to 
          participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their 
          children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, 
          Citrix's web site by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent 
          of their parent or guardian. </p>
