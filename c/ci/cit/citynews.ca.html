Yes, we have found it convenient for some consumers to contact them by phone either to start new subscriptions or to renew an existing subscription.  The authorized agents who sell new subscriptions are required to make use of the national "Do Not Call" registry so that they do not call the phone numbers of people who have registered. You can get more information about the "Do Not Call" registry here <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/INFO_SHT/t1031.htm" target="_blank" class="bodylink">http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/INFO_SHT/t1031.htm</a>.  For telemarketing related to the renewals of existing subscriptions, you can update your contact preferences by logging in to your subscriber service page which can be found here. <br>

                                            Occasionally an advertiser may ask that we print the name of subscribers in their advertisement in our publications. When this is done, the subscriber's name is printed on the ad at the same time that the mailing label is printed on the cover of the magazine, and the subscriber's name appears only in their personal copy of the magazine. If you would prefer not have your name included in such advertisements, please contact us at Magazine Subscriber Service and specify 'Do Not Personalize'.</p>

                                            Our sites use industry-standard security measures to protect data against           loss, misuse and interception by third parties.

That goes for information disclosed on message boards, in chat areas           - or even in e-mail. Rogers is not responsible if that information is           intercepted.

Contest           entries generally include a way for you to indicate that you do not want           to be contacted based on the information on your entry. Because contests           may involve co-sponsors outside Rogers who have their own privacy practices,           it is always advisable to read the entry form and contest rules before           entering.<br>
