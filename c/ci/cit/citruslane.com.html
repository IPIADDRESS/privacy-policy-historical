  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 20, 2011</p>


    


  <h3>Our Policy:</h3>

  <p>Welcome to the web site (the “<em>Site</em>”) of Citrus Lane, Inc. (“<em>Citrus Lane</em>”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”).
  This Site is operated by Citrus Lane and has been created to provide information about our company and its product
  discovery and content community services (the “<em>Services</em>”) to our users (“you”, “your”). This Privacy
  Policy sets forth Citrus Lane’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable
  data (“<em>Personal Data</em>”), and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of
  the Services.</p>

  <h3>Information We Collect:</h3>

  <p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information
  from you, as further described below:</p>

  <h4>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</h4>

  <p class="indent">We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when
  you register for access to the Services (for example, your name, information about your child, your email
  address and mailing address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys.
  Wherever Citrus Lane collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. </p>

  <p class="indent"><em>
    By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
    transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Citrus Lane and the authorized third
    parties referred to herein located in the United States.
  </em></p>

  <h4>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</h4>

  <p class="indent">
    When you interact with Citrus Lane through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain personally
    non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies,
    cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Citrus Lane may store such information itself or such
    information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Citrus Lane affiliates, agents or service
    providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the
    total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our
    visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services.  Also, in an
    ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Citrus Lane often conducts research on
    its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to
    us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Citrus Lane may share this non-identifiable
    and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and
    aggregate information does not identify you personally. Citrus Lane may also disclose aggregated user statistics
    in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for
    other lawful purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that
    the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide
    additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may
    set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a
    password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect
    Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar.
    Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie
    and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage
    of some of the Site’s features.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>

  <p>
    Citrus Lane uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you
    provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which
    it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer
    your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the
    Services (for example, to have products shipped to you), we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access
    to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Citrus Lane and its subsidiaries and affiliates
    (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information
    collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our
    users and to improve the Services. Citrus Lane and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate
    with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. Further, if
    you are the recipient of a Box (as defined in our Terms of Service), we may use your Personal Data to respond to
    your requests for support, request feedback on Boxes and provide you with offers we believe may be of interest to
    you. Each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving
    future marketing communications. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative
    communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications.  In
    addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name
    deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
  </p>

  <p>
      In addition, if you initiate a purchase using the Service but do not complete the transaction, we may use the
    email address you provide to send you email for the purpose of requesting feedback on your purchase experience.
    You are not obligated to respond to such email, but if you do, we may use your feedback to improve our user
    experience.
  </p>

  <p>
      If Citrus Lane intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy,
      you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3>

  <p>
    Citrus Lane is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital
    part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal
    Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
  </p>

  <h4>Business Transfers:</h4>

  <p class="indent">
    As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
    reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
  </p>

  <h4>Related Companies:</h4>

  <p class="indent">We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with
  this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h4>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</h4>

  <p class="indent">
    Citrus Lane, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related
    functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, shipping and
    fulfillment, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature,
    we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
  </p>

  <h4>Legal Requirements:</h4>

  <p class="indent">
    Citrus Lane may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
    action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
    Citrus Lane, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public,
    or (iv) protect against legal liability.
  </p>

  <h3>Your Choices:</h3>

  <p>You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data,
  you may not be able to use certain Services.</p>

  <h3>Exclusions:</h3>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Citrus Lane other than Personal Data
    collected through the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you
    provide to Citrus Lane through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to,
    information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards, forums or blogs (collectively,
    “Public Areas”), any reviews, posts, ideas or designs for new products or boxes or modifications to existing
    products or boxes, feedback, suggestions and unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”).
    All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Citrus Lane shall be free to reproduce, use,
    disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.
  </p>

  <h3>Children:</h3>

  <p>
    Citrus Lane does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age
    of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal guardians to
    monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never
    to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under
    the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Citrus Lane through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor
    to delete that information from our databases.
  </p>

  <h3>Links to Other Web Sites:</h3>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or
    controlled by Citrus Lane (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to
    the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Citrus Lane endorses or has reviewed the Third
    Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h3>Security:</h3>

  <p>
    Citrus Lane takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and
    unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic
    transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information
    you send to us in this way.
  </p>

  <h3>Other Terms and Conditions:</h3>

  <p>Your access to and use of this Site is subject to the
    <a href="http://www.citruslane.com/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

  <h3>Changes to Citrus Lane’s Privacy Policy:</h3>

  <p>
    The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Citrus Lane
    to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Citrus Lane reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at
    any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before
    you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use
    of the Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of
    such revised Privacy Policy.
  </p>
