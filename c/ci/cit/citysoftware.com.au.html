            <p>CSW-IT respects your individual privacy. This Privacy Policy   ('Policy') embodies our commitment to its protection through adherence   to fair electronic information practices. This Policy puts you, the   individual, in control of how your personal information is processed.   You have our promise that we will not electronically process your   personal information in any way that is incompatible with this Policy.<br>
<br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the Web site.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy protects your privacy by Informing you about: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The types of personal information CSW-IT collects about you through its web sites </li>
              <li>How it collects that information </li>
              <li>The general purposes for which it collects such information <br>
              </li>
            </ul>            <strong>Assuring you that CSW-IT: </strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>Takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information from   loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or   destruction. </li>
  <li>Implements reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that   personal information is kept only for the purposes for which it has been   gathered; </li>
  <li>Uses reasonable measures to ensure that we have accurately and   completely recorded the personal information you have provided; and </li>

  </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Getting to Know Our Customers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong> CSW-IT is in the business of supplying goods and services to our   customers. That requires more than simply offering innovative technical   services. It also requires that we understand you, our customer, and   your needs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
We get to know you primarily through the information you provide to us   when you contact us to use one or more of our services. The information   you provide ranges from basic contact information and payment   information. All of the information we request from you when purchasing   our goods and/or services is obligatory. When you purchase our goods   and/or services, you agree to provide us with complete and current   information. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
After you have purchased any of our goods and/or services, we may   communicate with you about your account, answer questions you may have   about what we provided you, or any other relevant matter. Those   communications are essential to our relationship with you and to our   ability to provide you with quality service that is responsive to your   needs. At the same time, those communications give us helpful insights   about you, your preferences and the ways in which we might improve our   services. We therefore may maintain this information for future use by   CSW-IT. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems   designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,   alteration or destruction of that information. We also encrypt your   transmission of sensitive information to us (e.g., credit card numbers,   account passwords) in the interest of heightened privacy protection and   information integrity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Third Party Advertising and Cookies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong>We use links to some of our suppliers on our Web site. In the course of   providing these links, some of these companies may place or recognize a   unique 'cookie' on your browser, and may use information (not including   your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your   visits to their and other web sites in order to measure advertising   effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and services of   interest to you. Please also examine the Privacy Policies of these   companies. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Information Corrections or Changes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong> &nbsp;You have the ability to correct or change certain information in our   records, such as your address and contact information. The process for   changing your information begins at www.csw-it.com.au &lt;<a href="http://www.estore.com.au">http://www.estore.com.au</a>&gt;   . You may change this information at any time and as often as   necessary. If you need assistance or have questions about correcting   information, you can contact us via e-mail at <a href="http://www.cswit.com.au/sales@estore.com.au">sales@estore.com.au</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>How We Put Information to Good Use &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong> &nbsp;We use any information about you for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we:<br>
<ul>
  <li>bill you properly, </li>
  <li>administer your account in accordance with good and proper accounting practices, and </li>
  <li>properly supply the goods and/or services you have requested. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our   internal operations For example; we may correlate Web site traffic   information with data about individual users. This data helps us to   determine how much our customers use parts of the site, allowing us to   enhance it to fit the needs of as many of our customers as possible. We   may also break down overall usage statistics according to customers'   domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information   from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience of   users in our network of sites is our reliance on cookie files. We use   cookie files to make it easier for users to access our site or services.   A cookie file is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your   hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information   such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have   visited. However, the only personal information a cookie can contain is   information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard   disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to   track user traffic patterns (as described above) when you register for   CSW-IT services. When you register, we may use a cookie to store a   unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in   our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you   will receive the warning message with each cookie. You may refuse   cookies by turning them off in your browser. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important notices   and information affecting your account or services, as well as to   provide general information that may be of interest to you, including   newsletters, surveys, and information about our services or product   offerings. You may opt-out of receiving information from us simply by   notifying us of your desire in accordance with the opt-out instructions   contained in any information message you receive from us. Note, however,   that in order to fulfil our service obligations to you, we must   continue sending you notices and other important information affecting   your account or services. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>With Whom We May Share Information &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong> We value you as our own customer and we do not share or disclose any   information about you to any external company or organization. The   information that you supply to us is used to conduct business   transactions with you and to enable us to better meet your needs and   requirements. Your information is not sold or given to any other   organization. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
When you supply us with a credit card number that is used to make a   payment to us we securely transmit this to our bank where the credit   card transaction is either accepted or declined by the bank. We do not   store your credit card details on any of our sites or systems. The bank   stores any necessary details about our transaction/s with you, we do   store a payment authorisation reference number associated with your   transaction/s. It is not possible for this reference number to be used   for any other purpose other than recording the fact that we conducted a   credit card transaction with you. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Our Accountability to You &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong> By purchasing our goods and/or services, you obtain the protections of,   and consent to the data processing practices described in, this Privacy   Policy. When you purchase our services, you also represent to us that   you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party   individuals whose personal data you supply to us with regard to:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>the purposes&nbsp;for which such third party's personal data have been collected, </li>
  <li>the intended&nbsp;recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data, </li>
  <li>which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary, and </li>
  <li>how the &nbsp;third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our employees,   agents and business partners are independently responsible for ensuring   compliance with this Privacy Policy, as described below. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Employee Accountability &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong> Only those CSW-IT employees that have a legitimate business purpose for   accessing and handling information obtained by us are given   authorization to do so. The unauthorized access or use of such   information by a csw-it employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds   for disciplinary action. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a   way as to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that   they have no authority to access. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Notification of Changes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</strong>If and when we make any changes to any part of this Privacy Policy we   will amend the effective date displayed at the top of this page. </td>
