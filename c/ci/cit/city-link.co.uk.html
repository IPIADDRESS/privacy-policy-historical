<h1>Initial City Link Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We believe it is important to clearly state Initial City Link's Privacy Policy.
  For this reason we have used plain english (with a minimum of "jargon"-
  IT or legal). If you require clarification of any of these points then please
  email <a href="mailto:webmaster@city-link.co.uk">webmaster@city-link.co.uk</a> 
  . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions about our Privacy Policy</h2>
<h2><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies </h2>
<h3>So what are They?</h3>
<p> Cookies are small pieces of information "remembered" by your web 
  browser. We use standard "session cookies" in our site solely to store a "session id"
  for your visit to our web site. A session ID contains no personal information
  at all and is just a value would be something like: sfbeb2a41f49fdb8b001ed9416e45b733.
  The image below shows the a sample of our cookie contents.</p>
<p><img src="cookie.gif" width="405" height="435" alt="Cookie data example"></p>
<h3>So Why do City Link use Cookies?</h3>
<p>Because of the way the World Wide Web "protocol" works if we didn't
  do this the server would think you are were a different visitor every time you asked
  for a page from our site. This would make some elements of the site - particularly
  job booking impossible to use.</p>
<p>It would be especially annoying to many of our customers who stay logged in 
  throughout the day just so they can check the status of a job whenever they 
  want.</p>
<p>The session ID also allows us to monitor which areas of the site are most popular 
  with our customers.</p>
<h3>Why should you be Concerned? (or even remotely Interested?)</h3>
<p>The reason is simply that a cookie is a file just like all the others on your 
  hard disk. If it contained personal information then it could theoretically 
  be read by someone else if they could gain access to your computer. It is because 
  of this risk that all web browsers give you the option to"Turn Off" 
  cookies altogether or at least prompt before accepting a cookie from a site. 
</p>
<p>Whether you accept, reject or prompt before accepting cookies is a choice for 
  you and you Organisation. Initial City Link makes no recommendation about the 
  settings you should use. We merely state that the cookie we send to your browser 
  contains no personal information.</p>
<h3>What happens if the City Link Cookie is Rejected?</h3>
<p>If a cookie is rejected then our server will try to add the session ID to the 
  address of each web page send to you. Unfortunately this may not be possible. 
  Under those circumstances you would not be able to use our site.</p>
<p>If this is the case your local branch would be happy to assist you by phone 
  or fax.</p>

<h2><a name="ssl"></a>Secure SSL Encryption</h2>
<h3>What is SSL Encryption?</h3>
<p>SSL Encryption is a public key encryption technology that encrypts all data 
  sent to or from a website so that it cannot be read or changed by anyone else 
  on the Internet. It is the established standard for high security transactions 
  e.g. credit card payments via the Internet.</p>
<h3>Does that mean it is unsafe to access sites without SSL?</h3>
<p>This is a question which only you and your organisation can answer. There are 
  some companies and organisations who would use encryption for all their data 
  sent across the Internet and some who would use it very rarely (although most 
  people would agree that credit card data should always be encrypted).</p>
<p>Accessing a normal website is no more risky (and in some ways safer) than sending 
  information by Internet email.</p>
<h3>So why is SSL only an option on the City Link Site?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately there is no such thing as a free lunch and the trade off for 
  having such a very heavily encrypted data exchange is performance. </p>
<p>Your computer has to encrypt all data before sending it. The server then decrypts 
  it, processes the request, encrypts the reply and sends it back to you. Your 
  browser then decrypts the reply and displays it to you. Depending on the speed 
  of your computer the delay may be "quite noticeable".</p>
<p>By giving you the choice at logon time to use SSL or the unencrypted site we 
  are allowing you to choose the option which best meets your needs and security 
  policy of your business.</p>
<p>Whichever option you choose your password is always encrypted before it is sent.</p>
