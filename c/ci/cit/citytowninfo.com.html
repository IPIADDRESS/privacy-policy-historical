<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. &nbsp;In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). &nbsp;If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>

<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site. &nbsp;We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.
