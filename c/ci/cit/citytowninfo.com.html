<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site.

<p><strong>Third Party VENDORS</strong></p>
<p>We also work with vendors and partners in operating and improving the Site.&nbsp; These vendors and other partners include advertisers (including both banner and text advertising), retargeters and web analytics companies.&nbsp; These partners and vendors use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at the Site and at times other third party sites) in order to: help manage ad campaigns, understand user interests and trends and deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on the Site or on other sites.&nbsp; You can opt out of some of our vendors' use of cookies and other technologies to tailor personalized content or advertising to you by visiting <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</a>.&nbsp; Please note that if you delete all cookies, the opt-out cookie may be deleted and you will need to perform the opt out again.&nbsp; For more information, see &nbsp;http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/faqs.asp#question_11.</p>
