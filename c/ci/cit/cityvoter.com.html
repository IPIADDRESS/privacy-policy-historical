                            CityVoter, Inc. (”CityVoter”) is an online and mobile platform that helps people find products and

                            includes soliciting and aggregating votes and user recommendations. Our users vote, share their favorites, create 
                            lists, ask questions, invite friends, and write recommendations about local businesses. These recommendations 
                            are posted on our web site, mobile application, and web sites we create with sponsor partner (collectively 
                            the ”Platform”). We also interact with marketing partners to bring to the attention of our users 
                            products and services we believe the users will find interesting (sponsor partners and marketing partners are 
                            collectively referred to as the ”Partners”). We also engage with Merchants (the ”Merchants”) 
                            to make available discounted products and services to users on behalf of the Merchants. This privacy 
                            policy (”Privacy Policy”) outlines the types of personal information we may collect when you use 
                            the CityVoter service (”Service”), which is further described in the Terms of 
                            Service (”Terms and Conditions”) available at http://cityvoter.com/help/terms-and-conditions as well as some of 
                            the steps we take to secure it.

                            you a personal message). Our Partners may also send you emails with offers or information
                            believed pertinent to you, but you may choose not to receive these emails in accordance
                            with the Partner's opt-out process.

                        <h5>3. Transfer of Information</h5>

                        <p>
                            We share and/or license your information with our Partners, Merchants, and Payment Vendors and may transfer 
                            your information to these parties during the course of providing the Service or for marketing campaigns. We also 
                            may syndicate your questions, lists or voting results from your contests to third parties, in which case your screen name and any personally identifiable information you have included in your questions, lists or recommendations may be shown to users of such third party web sites.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            CityVoter will disclose information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes. Further, CityVoter may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of CityVoter, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, the personal information about you is transferred and may become subject to a different privacy policy. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            CityVoter will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>4. Use of Cookies</h5>

                        <p>
                            Like most websites, CityVoter requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user’s computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter our site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every time. You should be aware that CityVoter cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the CityVoter Platform. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>5. Controlling Your Personal Information</h5>

                        <p>
                            As a registered CityVoter user, you can modify your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing 
                            the ”Settings” section of the site. If you wish to have your information removed 
                            or your account terminated, you can contact CityVoter <a href="javascript:location='mailto:support@cityvoter.com';void%200">support@cityvoter.com</a>. CityVoter will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally remove you and your personal information from the Platform.  As with most websites, it may be impossible to remove your account and comments without some residual information being retained by CityVoter. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>6. Security</h5>

                        <p>
                            Your CityVoter account is password-protected. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0070\u0072\u0069\u0076\u0061\u0063\u0079\u0040\u0063\u0069\u0074\u0079\u0076\u006f\u0074\u0065\u0072\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void%200">privacy@cityvoter.com</a>. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <em>
                                You hereby acknowledge that CityVoter is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet or via mobile carriers, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.

                        <h5>7. Children</h5>

                        <p>
                            The CityVoter website is not directed to children. CityVoter does not knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or guardian) to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information. 
                        </p>

                        <h5>8. Third Party Links and Advertising</h5>

                        <p>
                            Our website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. CityVoter does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy polices on these third party websites. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you use our Platform. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="new">click here</a>.

                            Under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (the ”Act”), we are required to inform users of our Platform who reside in the state of California what information we have collected from you and information as to how to update or change that information. To receive this information, please send us a letter in writing at CityVoter, 2464 Mass Ave, Suite 210, Cambridge, MA 02140.

                            By using the Platform, you signify your agreement to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Platform.

If a material change is made to this Privacy Policy and/or the way we use our users’ personally identifiable information, then we will post a prominent notice of the nature of such change on the first page of this Privacy Policy and also on our home page. You are responsible for reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it. Your continued use of the site indicates your assent to any changes to this Privacy Policy.
