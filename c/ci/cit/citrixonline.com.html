		<b>2. What information does Citrix Online gather/track and how is it used?</b>
		<p>All information gathered at either <a href="http://www.citrixonline.com">www.citrixonline.com</a> or on <a href="http://www.workshifting.com/">www.workshifting.com</a> is done so on a voluntary basis. You need not provide us with any personal information to use these sites. Information submitted on these sites can include contact information such as email addresses, comments on blog postings and job and press inquiries.</p>
		<p>TRAFFIC PATTERNS: We track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our sites, .however, we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual users. We also track domain names, browser types and MIME type.</p>
		<p>COOKIES: A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. When you register for services at Citrix Online sites, we use cookies to store unique, randomly assigned user IDs that we generate for administrative purposes. These cookies enable you to enter the Citrix Online sites without having to log on each time. We do not store passwords or any Personal Information about you in the cookies.</p>
		<p>We continuously improve our Web sites and utilize different Web analytic tools to help us do so. We are interested in how visitors use our Web sites, what they like and dislike, and where they have problems. The Web beacons used in connection with our Web analytics services do not share any personally identifiable information about our Web site visitors with third parties. Our tools may gather data such as what browser a person uses, what operating systems are used and what content, products and services are reviewed when visiting or registering for services at one of our Web sites. This information is used solely to assist Citrix Online in maintaining more effective and useful Web sites for our customers.</p>
		<p>Citrix Online also partners with selected marketing companies to help us track the effectiveness of our Web sites, generate visitor traffic and as part of our affiliate referral program through Commission Junction (http://www.cj.com). When a partner refers a visitor to us from any of these sites, they set a Web beacon and a cookie on our site. An ad ID and a partner ID are stored in the cookie, but no personally identifiable information specific to the actual visitor is stored. Citrix Online does not see the cookie; we only include the Web beacon on our page, which results in a request to the partner's servers from the customer browser. We have no control over their use of the cookie after it is placed on our site.</p>
		<p>The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the Web site if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies in order to establish an account and to download and install Citrix Online products.</p>
		<p>SURVEYS: In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development. We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user. Such information will not be passed to third parties without your prior consent unless where required by applicable law.</p>
		<p>This privacy policy is subject to change at the sole discretion of Citrix Online. When we modify the privacy policy, we will post the changes in a revised policy statement.
