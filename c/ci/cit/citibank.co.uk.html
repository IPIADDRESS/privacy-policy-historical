              <br>
              You can visit this site and find out about our products and services, 
              read our Corporate reports, check on career opportunities, or use

              In order to provide better service or to address security hazards, 
              we will occasionally use a "<a href="/personal/banking/info/privacy/cookie.htm">cookie</a>". 
              A cookie is a piece of information which a web server may place 
              on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are commonly 
              used by websites to improve the user experience and have not been 
              known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. 
              None will contain information that will enable anyone to contact 
              you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. <br>
              <br>
              Many cookies last only through a single session, or visit. Others 
              may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until 
              you delete them. You can set up your Web browser to inform you when

              <strong>How We Use Cookies </strong><br>
              <br>
              We use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain

              of our website for research and other purposes. Our cookies will 
              track only your activity relating to our online promotions, which 
              may be located at our website or the websites of others. They will 
              not track your other Internet activity. Our cookies typically do 
              not gather personally identifiable information. However, if your 
              web browser is set to accept cookies, we may combine our cookie 
              data with personally identifiable information which you provide 
              to us (such as your email address), so that you may receive marketing 
              offers specifically suited to your needs. Please note that in order

              We occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our websites

              only use the information they gather for our purposes in accordance 
              with the terms of the contract they have signed with us. </p>
