                      <p><strong>Information Collection and Use </strong></p>
                      <p>Citizens Energy Group understands that security and privacy are important issues for visitors to our web site, CITIZENSENERGYGROUP.COM (the "Site") and recognizes our obligations to keep your information secure and confidential. That is why we maintain the standards outlined below to help protect information that personally identifies you. Citizens  Energy Group collects information from our users at several different points on our Site. We do this to understand how to better serve our customers. We will not sell, share, or rent this information collected on this Site to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. </p>
                      <p>You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, billing address, credit card information, phone number, utility account number, email address or other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to have access to some features of the Site. By using the Site and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to our use of such information as described in this Policy. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, and this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain products or services. We or our business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as your IP number (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) or the type of browser you are using ("Anonymous Information"), through the use of cookies or by other means. We hope that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the Site to make it more useful to you and other users. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Anonymous Information, without limitation.</p>
                      <p>Citizens  Energy Group uses your Personal Information for the following purposes: to access customer services, respond to or communicate with you, address issues you identify, further improve this Site, forward your e-mail or communication to another agency or entity for appropriate action, to provide Internet security; or to meet legal requirements. Information received by Citizens  from your communication with this Site, including your e-mail address, is not collected for commercial marketing purposes. </p>
                      <p><strong>Registration </strong></p>
                      <p>We require Citizens Energy Group customers to register so that we may create unique user ID and password (login) information. Residential customers may create their username and password, which allows them to gain access to their personal, protected account information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password and such use shall be deemed to be use by you. You will ensure that all use of your account fully complies with the Terms and Conditions set forth below. Transfer of the account by you to any other person or entity is prohibited. </p>
                      <p>During registration users must submit their contact and account information (such as name, email address and utility account number). This information is used to contact users about the services on our Site for which they have expressed interest so that we may complete their requests. </p>
                      <p><strong>Sharing </strong></p>
                      <p>We do not currently share any specific demographic information from this Site with unaffiliated third parties, nor do we provide specific credit or usage information to unaffiliated third party service providers. Citizens Energy Group may provide customer contact information to unaffiliated third party service providers. Such information exists independent from information collected from this Site. This type of information would not be associated with a user's personal information and would not be used to identify an individual person. </p>
                      <p>We may work with our business partners who may perform certain functions on our behalf, such as customer billing and payment, sending email messages, managing data, or providing customer service. These business partners have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these specific functions and may not use it for any other purpose. </p>
                      <p>In the event that we partner with another party to provide specific services, we will share names and other contact information when the user signs up for these services. These parties cannot use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these specific services. Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally required to do so. If Citizens Energy Group is involved in the sale of a substantial portion of its business assets, Anonymous or Personal Information maybe among the transferred assets. </p>

                      <p>In order for this Site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from outside sources.
