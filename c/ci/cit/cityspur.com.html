<p>4. We will NOT knowingly allow a child under the age of 13 access to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, or other services within CitySpur.com that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>5. We will NOT knowingly allow a teen between the ages of 13 and 17 access to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, or other services within CitySpur.com that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without first notifying a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>6. We will NOT knowingly ask a child or teen to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.</p>
<p>7. We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to Web sites that are unsuitable for children or teens.</p>
<p>8. CitySpur.com will not advertise on any site that does not comply with the regulations set forth under COPPA.</p>
<p>9. We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.</p>
<p>10. Upon request, CitySpur.com will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child or teen during a registration process for a program or service of our site. CitySpur.com only asks for a child’s or teen’s personal information if it is necessary to participate in the program or service. The site administrator also has access to the registration data but it is only used for site maintenance. Registration data that is provided about children or teens is not used for marketing and is never shared with any other party. If you would like to view your child’s registration data, request a change, or request that we delete any of your child’s personal information, please send an e-mail to info@cityspur.com which includes your child’s first and last name, school zip code, and your first and last name.</p>
<p>CitySpur.com urges parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our Kids’ Privacy Policy please e-mail CitySpur.com at info@cityspur.com.</p>
<p>Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent:</p>
<p>Certain areas and activities within CitySpur.com may ask visitors under the age of 18 to provide personal information such as their name, date of birth, e-mail address or school name. We only ask for the information that is necessary to participate in the particular activity.</p>
<p>Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child or teen is participating. Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child’s participation in the activity. If the child is under 13 years of age we require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as an e-mail to RealGM.com. If the individual is a teen between the ages of 13 and 17, CitySpur.com will notify the parent or guardian that his or her teen is participating and sharing personal information but we do not require consent.</p>
<p>When verifiable parental consent has not yet been obtained, we will use online contact information (such as an e-mail address) only as is appropriate to:</p>
<p>request the name or online contact information of a parent or guardian for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notification to the parent or guardian;<br>
respond directly to the child’s or teen’s request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular study question), not using that information to re-contact the child or teen for any other purpose;<br>
respond more than once directly to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription), not using that information to re-contact the child or teen for any other purpose.<br>
Third-Party Advertising:</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Please contact info@cityspur.com if you wish to inquire about these third-party agencies’ privacy policies.</p>
<p>Third-Party Cookies:</p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.</p>
<p>What are Cookies?</p>
<p>The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry; you’ll find them used on CitySpur.com, as you will at other major sites. “Cookies” are small text files written to your computer. They make our site easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you are at our sites (although we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which need a bit of improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members.</p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable information we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to RealGM.com may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies).</p>
<p>While browsing through CitySpur.com, you may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. CitySpur.com and its affiliated sites do not control these cookies.</p>
<p>What are IP Addresses?</p>
<p>An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers – the big computers that “serve up” Web pages – automatically identify your computer by its IP address.</p>
<p>CitySpur.com collects IP addresses for system administration; to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our site and to ensure compliance with the Terms of Use (and to address violations of the Terms of Use). When visitors request pages from CitySpur.com sites, our servers log the guests’ IP addresses. We normally do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses (and other personal information, but only to the extent necessary) to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or our Terms of Use, or to protect our service, site, customers, or other individuals.</p>
<p>Some features within RealGM.com, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message-poster’s visitor name and message. You should review each feature prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable sharing.</p>
<p>A Notice About Our Advertisers:</p>
<p>CitySpur.com uses outside advertising companies to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, CitySpur.com does NOT work with any partners who do not comply with our privacy policy guidelines.</p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
<p>A Notice About External Links:</p>
<p>Occasionally, you will find links from CitySpur.com to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed sites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you’ll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use CitySpur.com’s logo as part of a co-branding agreement.</p>
<p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We don’t control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our site, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.</p>
<p>CitySpur.com has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, while you may see CitySpur.com’s logo on another company’s site. CitySpur.com does not share any of your personally identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any information back with us. Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can’t find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site’s Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information.</p>
<p>We specifically recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking on to any new sites.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of CitySpur.com, or your dealings with CitySpur.com, please e-mail us at info@cityspur.com.</p>
