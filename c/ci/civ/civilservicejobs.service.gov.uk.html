<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purposes for which we are processing your personal data are: </p>
<ul>
<li>to manage recruitment for Civil Service organisations and non-departmental public bodies. This includes a job board, online application service, sift tests, interview scheduling, and pre-employment checking service</li>
<li>to assess your suitability for a role</li>
<li>to enable the creation of user accounts</li>
<li>for civil servant candidate accounts, to allow users to view and apply for internal and across-government vacancies</li>
<li>to offer a job alert email service</li>
<li>to offer a priority mover service to help civil servants find new roles when they are at risk of redundancy</li>
<li>to provide technical support to candidates and recruiters</li>
<li>to monitor the effectiveness of recruitment processes - this could include statistical analysis of system usage, or research into the experience of applicants and other system users, or analysing referral sources to see which provide the most diverse applicants</li>
<li>to undertake pre-employment checking and onboarding activity before you start in a role in the Civil Service (including health, pension questionnaire, character declaration)</li>
<li>to comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard" rel="external">Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</a> which consists of:
<ul>
<li>verification of identity </li>
<li>
verification of nationality and immigration status - including entitlement to undertake the work in question</li>
<li>
verification of employment history - through cross-referencing information against the HMRC PAYE system or through references </li>
<li>
verification of criminal record (unspent convictions) - for HMRC vacancies this check will also include spent convictions </li>
<li>
additional verification - only applies where additional verification or assurance is required</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal basis of processing </h3>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Contractual: it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party - an employment contract. This relates to information that we need to recruit and employ you.</li>
<li>Contractual: it is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract for employment. This relates to information that we collect as part of the application and selection process.</li>
<li>
Legal obligation: it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation placed on us as the data controller - we are required to report on equality of opportunity; and onboarding processes have specific requirements</li>
<li>
Public task: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller. In this case, Civil Service Jobs facilitates recruitment of high-quality candidates to roles across government departments, agencies and other public bodies. It provides recruitment tools and processes that support Civil Service recruitment strategy, and we also monitor the effectiveness of recruitment processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sensitive personal data is personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. </p>

<p>The legal basis for processing your sensitive personal data is: </p>

<ul>
<li>it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest for the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice; and an appropriate policy document is in place. Civil Service Jobs facilitates recruitment of high-quality candidates to roles across government departments, agencies and other public bodies. It provides recruitment tools and processes that support Civil Service recruitment strategy. </li>
<li>it is necessary for the purposes of performing or exercising our obligations or rights as the controller, or your obligations or rights as the data subject, under employment law, social security law or the law relating to social protection. External recruitment is required to follow the Civil Service Commission Recruitment Principles. Personal data is processed to ensure that these requirements are met. We are required under the Equality Act 2010 to make appropriate reasonable adjustments for candidates with a disability.  </li>
<li>processing is of a specific category of personal data and it is necessary for the purposes of identifying or keeping under review the existence or absence of equality of opportunity or treatment between groups of people specified (in paragraph 8(2) of Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 2018) in relation to that category with a view to enabling such equality to be promoted or maintained; and it is not carried out for the purposes of measures or decisions with respect to a particular data subject; and you have not declined consent; and you have not given notice that you do not wish your data to be processed for these purposes; and the processing is not likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual. Diversity and inclusion data is used anonymously: ethnicity, religion, community background (Northern Ireland vacancies only), and sexual orientation. </li>
<li>
it is necessary for archiving purposes, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, and it is in the public interest. Analysis of applications and recruitment outcomes (including online tests), impact on protected groups, timescales for recruitment, and other research may be carried out.</li>

</ul>

<p>The processing by us of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures is not carried out under official authority, but is authorised because it meets the following condition:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. This is ensuring that individuals with access to official information and assets will meet the required standards of propriety.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT infrastructure it will also be shared with our data processors who provide email and document management and storage services to us. </p>


<h3>Retention</h3>

<p>Your personal data will be kept by us for the following durations:</p>

<p>Application records and associated files (including CVs, letters, emails, comment and feedback) will be deleted 2 years after the vacancy is archived.  A vacancy becomes archived when there are no active applications and either:</p>
<ul><li>
the vacancy is manually archived by a recruiter; or </li>
<li>
the vacancy is automatically archived 1 year after the advertised closing date.</li>
</ul>

<p>Candidate accounts - you can, at any time, choose to close your account. This will:</p>
<ul><li>remove your ability to login to the account</li>
<li>withdraw any active applications</li>
<li>delete partially-completed applications which haven’t been submitted</li>
<li>disable the automatic sending of job alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Closed accounts are deleted and cannot be restored, however previously submitted applications will be retained until deletion for the period described above.</p>

<p>Candidate accounts that are active will remain in the system unless the candidate deletes them (or makes a request for deletion). An account will become inactive if the user has not logged in for two years.  </p>

<p>Vacancy manager accounts</p>
<p>ATS account holders are required to periodically reconfirm that they still require access, otherwise the account will become inactive.</p>
  <p>Inactive accounts will be deleted three years after the last time the user logged in. Active accounts will remain in the system.</p>

<h3>Automated decision making </h3>

<p>Your personal data will be subject to automated decision making when online psychometric tests are used.</p>

<p>Some vacancies use online psychometric tests in the early stages of recruitment.  Three tests are commonly used: Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Reasoning and the Civil Service Judgement Test. </p>
<p>Decisions are made on who to invite to later stages based on automated scoring and sifting processes.  In addition, test scores and other applicant data are regularly captured for statistical and research analysis purposes.</p>
<p>Your score is calculated from the responses you give during the test, and no other information about you is used.  We compare your score to those gained by a peer group who previously took the test, to give you a percentile. The vacancy will have a minimum percentile requirement, and if your score is lower than this, you will be rejected and your application will not be considered further.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to request information about how your personal data is processed, and to request a copy of that personal data. </p>

<p>You have the right to request a copy of any personal data you have provided, and for this to be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. </p>
