All e-mail mailing lists maintained by civic.com and its parent company, FCW Government Technology Group, contain
                  the names of people who requested to receive information from us.</p><p>
                  Currently, e-mail addresses may be used by FCW Government Technology Group  to
                  promote FCW and IDG products and services, surveys,
                  and for editorial consultations with users.  When a user has given us
                  explicit permission, his/her e-mail address may be rented to outside
                  firms for promotional purposes.  We allow users to "opt out" of
                  receiving e-mail from outside firms and/or from FCW Government Technology Group 
                  and its sister companies when e-mail information is collected. 
                  Users who later decide they want to change their preferences may
                  do so by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:subscriptions@fcw.com">subscriptions@fcw.com</a>.</p><p>

While FCW Government Technology Group  will seek to require third parties with whom it
                  has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not
                  bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third
                  parties.
