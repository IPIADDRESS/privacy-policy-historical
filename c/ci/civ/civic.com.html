<p>“Personal Information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<p>All individuals whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Information on behalf of Civic are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Policy. This Policy is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions.</p>
<h2><b>3. Collection of Information: Types of Information We Collect</b></h2>

<ul>
<li><b>To provide Services requested.</b> When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an account with Civic, requesting Services or information, verifying your identity through our Services, or contacting us directly, we may collect information from you such as your name, user name and password, email address, telephone number(s), mailing address, Social Security number, account numbers, payment information, government issued identification documents (e.g., passports, driver’s license, etc.), selfie image, biometric information, IP Address, utility bills, and statements to prove your current residence (e.g., bank statements).</li>

</ul>
<h3><b>Facial Biometric Identity Verification</b></h3>

From time to time, Civic may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage Third-Party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and Services we provide.

Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and Civic may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purposes.

<li><b>Information Submitted Via Services. </b>You agree that Civic is free to use the content of any communications submitted by you via the Services, including any ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services.

<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us, and Civic does not endorse or make any representations about Third-Party websites or social media platforms. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application that they interact with.

<h2><b>6. Sharing of Information</b></h2>
<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:</p>

In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Civic’s. Civic requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Civic provided it to them.</li>
<li><b>Marketing.</b> <b>Interest-Based Advertising and Third Party Marketing</b>. Through our websites (civic.com and other Civic-controlled websites), we may allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Civic related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable, or otherwise of interest to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Civic does not engage in interest-based advertising on its mobile app, and does not use information gathered from its mobile app for interest-based advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third-Party advertising partners, you may opt-out of such sharing at no cost by following the instructions below.</li>
<li><b>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures).</b> We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect yours’, ours’ or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iv) to enforce Civic policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Civic; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</b> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. Should such an event occur, Civic will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
<h2><b>7. Retention</b></h2>
<p>Civic retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p>
<h2><b>8. Security</b></h2>
<p>We take our responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your information, including Personal Information, very seriously. We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>
<p>By using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on <a href="http://www.civic.com">www.civic.com</a> or sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@civic.com">support@civic.com</a>.</p>
<h2><b>9. Your Choices</b></h2>
<h3><b>Communications Preferences</b></h3>

We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or Services you have requested.

<h3><b>Sharing Preferences</b></h3>
<p>We may give you choices regarding the sharing of Personal Information with affiliates and third parties. Choices you have about the sharing of your Personal Information will be described in the privacy policies or notices you receive in connection with the products or Services you obtain from us.</p>
<h3><b>Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</b></h3>
<p>You may inquire as to whether Civic is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend, or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to support@civic.com or use any of the methods set out in this Policy to request access to, receive (port), restrict Processing, seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Civic. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.</p>
<p>Although Civic makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Civic is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Civic determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Civic will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>
<h3><b>Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</b></h3>
<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
<h3><b>We tell you when our privacy policies and practices change.</b></h3>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by appropriate means such as by posting the revised policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date. All changes will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.
