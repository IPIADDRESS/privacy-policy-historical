<h2>Cisco Systems, Inc. Online Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>Cisco respects your privacy.  We want to make use of individual identifying information that you provide to us for purposes of serving you better. "Individual identifying information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title and address.  Cisco uses the individual identifying information  in order to personalize your experience on our website and also to be able to selectively send you communications that may be of interest to you, either electronically or otherwise.</p>

<p>Cisco's policy regarding use of your individual identifying information supplied to us or collected via your experience at our online website, CCO, covers these areas:</p>

<h3>1. Notice and Disclosure</h3>
<p>
This Online Privacy Statement is made available to you in order to make you aware of how Cisco collects and uses individual identifying information of visitors to Cisco's website.  
</p>
<p>
Cisco collects the following information regarding visitors to our website:  domain name,  name,  information regarding what pages are accessed, information volunteered by you, such as survey information, email address, or site registrations,  and your preferred means of communication.
</p>
<p>
Cisco does make individual identifying information available to third parties, including business partners, for marketing purposes.  Cisco also uses such information to contact people for marketing purposes.
</p>
<h3>2. Choice/Consent</h3>
<p>
New registrants to CCO have the choice to opt out of having individual identifying information provided in the registration process used for any purpose unrelated to the purpose for which the information was provided to us.   We are working on ways to enable you to communicate to us that your individual identifying information should not be used for additional purposes.
</p>
<p>
When you sign up for an email list, you will be given instructions at that time on how to remove yourself from that list.  
</p>
<p>
Access to certain of Cisco's webpages require a login and password   The use of those webpages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and Cisco.   Your individual identifying information may be retained by Cisco to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted,  to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on CCO.
</p>
<h3>3. Data Security</h3>
<p>
Cisco is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide to us.   
</p>
<h3>4. Data Quality and Access</h3>
<p>
The accuracy of your individual identifying information is important to Cisco.  We are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that Cisco maintains about you.  Registered CCO users can review their individual identifying information by accessing www.cisco.com/common/profile.shtml.
</p>
<h3>5. Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of CCO use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of CCO information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. Cisco Systems does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party. 
</p>
<p>
If you prefer not to receive cookies on CCO, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of CCO.
