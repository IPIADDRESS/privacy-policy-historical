This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for <a href="/index.asp">www.ciscopress.com</a>.</p>

<p>TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this Web site has agreed to notify you of:</p>

<ol>
<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personal identification is collected from you through the Web site.</li>
<li>The organization collecting the information.</li>
<li>How the information is used.</li>
<li>With whom the information may be shared.</li>
<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.</li>
<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Cisco Press's control.</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact our customer service department by e-mailing <a href="mailto:comments@informit.com">comments@informit.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html" target="_blank">http://www.TRUSTe.org/watchdog.html</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. However, please understand that the TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

<p>Cisco Press is operated from 800 East 96th Street, Suite 300, Indianapolis, IN, 46240, and is part of the Pearson Education family. You can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:information@ciscopress.com">information@ciscopress.com</a>.</p>

<p>Cisco Press and Pearson Education are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Ciscopress.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>

<p>Pearson Education recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of Personal Identifying Information about you as a user of our Web site. We consider the following information we collect from you to be Personal Identifying Information: e-mail address, name, password, mailing address, and credit card information.  This Web site does not collect Personal Identifying Information about a user other than information that is voluntarily provided to our Company; in this way, we can serve the user's needs as well as our own legitimate business purposes. (For example, we retain the Personal Identifying Information that a user provides when he or she registers with Ciscopress.com, part of the InformIT Network.)</p>

<p>If you choose to register a book with our site, this information will be tied to your Personal Identifying Information.</p>

<p>Our company uses a user's Personal Identifying Information in order to help us improve our Web site, or for our company's marketing and promotional purposes if you have opted to receive these kinds of communications. This information will be treated confidentially within our company. While our policy is not to share this information with third parties, we do share aggregate information with other companies within Pearson Education.</p>

<p>Cisco Press is a member of the InformIT Network. InformIT (<a href="http://www.informit.com" target="_blank">www.informit.com</a>) is also part of the Pearson Education family, and follows the same privacy guidelines outlined herein. InformIT is a member of TRUSTe, an online privacy verification company. We encourage you to <a href="http://www.informit.com/about/privacy.asp" target="_blank">read InformIT's Privacy Policy</a> and verify InformIT's participation in TRUSTe's program.</p>

<p>We make every effort to preserve user privacy, however we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p><p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to use certain areas of this site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to provide his or her e-mail address. This e-mail address is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which he or she has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic profile information (such as your job, technical interests, etc.), but encouraged so we can provide personalized services to the user, and learn more about our customers in aggregate.</p>

<p><strong>Order</strong></p>

<p>We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the customer.</p>

<p>Ciscopress.com uses a shopping cart that is shared by a number of business units within Pearson Education. This cart resides in a different domain, superlibrary.com, but is operated and controlled by Pearson Education, and follows our privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive tied to personal information about the user. Usage of a cookie is linked to personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes his or her browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to enter a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>

<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>

<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track individual users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>

<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>

<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p>We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>

<p><strong>Links</strong></p>

<p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Ciscopress.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects Personal Identifying Information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>

<p>If you have elected to receive e-mail newsletters but want to unsubscribe, simply visit the <a href="/u.asp">Newsletter Unsubscribe page</a> and uncheck the newsletters you'd no longer like to receive.</p>

<p><strong>Service Announcements</strong></p>

<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can remove their account information. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>

<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account. We reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes, when a user submits information through our <a href="/about/contact_us/index.asp">Contact forms</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as ZIP code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>

<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security Number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just browsing the web site.</p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Identifying Information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:comments@informit.com">comments@informit.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your e-mail address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by logging in and clicking "Edit Your Account" or by e-mailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:comments@informit.com">comments@informit.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong></p>

<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>

<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the ciscopress.com home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via an e-mail message. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if you have removed your personal information you will not be contacted, nor will your information be used in this new manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p></div></div>
