	<h2>CGSociety Privacy Policy</h2>
	<div class="divider closecut">
	<hr>
	</div>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>We are committed to respecting your privacy.
</p>
	<p>This document constitutes the Privacy Policy under which you may use CGSociety. Your use of CGSociety constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use CGSociety or any associated services. By using CGSociety, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
	<p>We are dedicated to providing a safe and secure user experience. This Privacy Policy tells you how we use personal information collected by us. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit CGSociety to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. </p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy is for CGSociety only. If you link to other websites, we encourage you to review their privacy policies so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other web sites to which you choose to link to from CGSociety. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information we collect via CGSociety and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion. 
</p>
	<p>Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access CGSociety outside the United States, your usage constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and to the United States. You also agree that your data may be transferred to any other country. 
</p>
	<p>We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents. 
</p>
	
	<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>

	<p>We may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number credit card number, social security number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. We may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favourites. Sometimes we may collect a combination of the two types of information. 
</p>
	<p>We may also gather certain information about your use of CGSociety's services, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that may be collected by us. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring web site addresses.We may ask to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioural, preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. </p>

	<h3>Public Information</h3>

	<p>Any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information. While we strive to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in public areas. 
</p>
	
	<h3> CGJobs Resumes and Profiles</h3>

	<p>We give you a number of options regarding the accessibility of your resume: 
</p>
	<ol class="privacy">
	<li>You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. </li>
	<li>If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential and hiding your contact information, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database will have access to your resume.</li>
	<li>If you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on CGJobs, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In addition, portions of your searchable resume may be made public in your CGJobs profile. 
</p>
	<p>We attempt to limit access to our resume database only to employers, recruiters, hiring managers, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. However, the portions of your searchable resume that are automatically made public in your CGJobs profile are accessible to anyone who uses the CGJobs service.
</p> 
	<p>You may remove your resume on CGJobs or delete your profile on CGJobs at anytime, but, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to the CGJobs resume database or to obtain a copy of that database or have paid for access to the CGJobs services, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access may have retained a copy of your resume or CGJobs profile in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles in these instances. 
</p>
<p>If you apply for a position on CGJobs, you may be asked to provide information on your gender, race or other protected status where permitted by applicable law. Some employers are required by law to gather this information from job applicants for reporting and record-keeping requirements. </p>

</p>

	<p>We may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to CGSociety to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be co-branded with our logo; however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner. 
</p>
	<p>We are not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for your convenience only.

In addition, in the event we may become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. 
</p>

</p>

<p>Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure we have put in place commercially reasonable and suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Only authorized employees, agents and contractors have access to this information. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. 
</p>
	<p>Your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. We use a service company to process credit card transactions and we do not store your credit card details. 
</p>
	<p>We will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access of your personal information. 
</p>
	<p>You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any CGSociety passwords and accounts. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other user or any other breach of security. 
</p>

<p>We may use cookies, applets, web beacons and other devices (collectively known as tracking technology). Personal information cannot be collected via tracking technology. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. If do not wish to receive cookies you can instruct your web browser to refuse them. However, doing so will prevent access to some areas of CGSociety and limit your use of some services. 
</p>

	<p>You may review, correct, update or change your information at any time. You may also opt out of receiving newsletters and certain other information from us. To change your information, simply log into your account and edit it with the options provided. 
</p>
	<p>We retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use of CGSociety more efficient, practical, and relevant. You can close and delete your information from our online database in which event we will remove all our copies of your information except for an archival copy which is not accessible on the Internet. 
</p>
	<p>You have a right to access most personal information we hold about you and if we deny access in some circumstances we will tell you why. To request access, please contact our privacy officer as set out at Contact Information. 
</p>


<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page. </p>
