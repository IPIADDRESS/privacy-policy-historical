<h3>CPACOREG.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, a property of Silvercarrot.com, has created this Privacy Policy 
to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your personally 
identifiable information at the <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> website (the "Website").  As part 
of our business, we collect and, in some instances, may disclose information about you - but only 
as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice 
explaining our personal information collection and use practices and the choices that you can 
make concerning the use of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy also applies to 
individuals that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> 
or one of our advertising partners, whether at the Website, via e-mail, on third-party websites or 
otherwise.</p>

<h5>Information Collected and Use of Your Information</h5>
<p>For each visitor to the Website, our servers automatically recognize only the visitor's domain 
name, but not the e-mail address (unless requested and supplied by the visitor as a part of 
registration).</p>

<p>You must register to become a member at <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> in order to qualify to 
receive the products and services available through our Website.  Some offers require a 
subsequent registration on the Milesource.com website.  To qualify and claim these offers, the 
instructions posted on the Milesource.com website must be followed.  The instructions may 
require the completion of a registration form, the completion of a survey and several weeks of 
active Milesource participation.  Please review the Milesource.com website for specific 
instructions as they apply to the individual offers.  If you wish to join Milesource.com to claim 
the offer and NOT join the Website please click here.  This link will direct you to a general 
Milesource.com registration page where you can begin the registration process.  On 
Milesource.com, you can view the offer of interest in the Milesource Award Center and the 
number of AwardMiles required to redeem that offer.</p>

<p>As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all visitors to the 
Website, we collect data from browsers to aggregate statistical information.  This includes the 
type of browser being used, its level of HTML support and what platform it is on.  This Privacy 
Policy also applies to visitors to the Website that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, but have not separately registered to become a 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> member.  The personal profile information that you submit to 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> remains your property, but by submitting that information to 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, its partners including, but not limited to, SilverNGold, 
Dealhighway.com, ConsumerValueDirect.com, SmartBrands, BargainSpot, SavingsAvalanche, 
Deal-zone.com, Couponandgifts.com, AskVinegarJoe.com, TVNewsDaily.com, 
AsmileADay.com, TensionBusters.com, YourDailySmile.com, YourSelfDaily.com, 
YourtimeDaily.com and/or any and all other affiliates, you grant .com the right 
to use that information for marketing purposes.    <span class="highlight">If you are a resident of the State of 
California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to 
any third party for marketing purposes, please click here or email us at: ______________.</span></p>

<p>When visitors elect to become members of <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, we request that 
they provide additional, personally-identifiable information.  This includes name, address, e-mail 
address, telephone number, age bracket, day and month of birth.  All registrants may receive e-
mail confirming their registration, and subsequent correspondence.  If you do not want to receive 
e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using the unsubscribe option on the bottom of 
every email.  Certain information, such as your e-mail address, is collected in order to, among 
other functions, verify your identity in the future within our database.  When you select to 
receive information about offerings from a third party company during the registration process, 
we will share your personal information with that third party company to carry out your 
information request.  <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> may also use such information to directly 
market certain offers to you (via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing), to monitor compliance 
with our Terms and Conditions and for content improvement and feedback purposes.  We may 
sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other 
businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members.  These businesses may include, 
but are not limited to:  (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including 
lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and 
(c) telemarketers. </p>

<p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. 
Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from 
customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis.  These agents have access to 
our members' personal information as needed to perform their functions for 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, but we do not permit them to use our members' personal 
information for other purposes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> reserves the right to release current or past member information 
in the event <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> believes that the membership is being or has been 
used in violation of the Website's terms and conditions, or to commit unlawful acts, if the 
information is subpoenaed, if <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> is sold or acquired, or when 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> deems it necessary or appropriate.  By agreeing to these 
conditions, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party, 
when .com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate 
including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression 
purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and 
Federal Trade Commission enabling regulations.</p>

<p>In addition, by registering at the Website, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or 
application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR ¤310 et seq.), as 
amended from time to time (the "Rule").  Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be 
listed at the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via 
telemarketing in accordance with the Rule.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from outside sources and add 
it to your existing registration information on file at the Website. We do this to improve 
personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising 
and/or special offers that we think may be of interest you).</p>

<p>We may also collect other information such as your IP address, domain names, access times and 
referring third party website addresses. This information is used by 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> for the operation of the Website, to maintain the quality of our 
offerings, and to provide general aggregate statistics regarding .com.  Such 
information is not personally identifiable. </p>

<p>We also collect information such as the identification of the server that your computer is logged 
onto and whether you opened a .com e-mail message delivered to you.  We also 
may compare our member list to various lists received from other third party companies, in an 
effort to avoid sending identical or similar e-mail messages to our members.</p>

<p>When you obtain any product or service directly from <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, we 
collect certain financial information, such as your credit card number, credit card expiration date 
and billing address.  Financial Information that you disclose to <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> 
is used to confirm your age and to bill you for shipping our products and services.  To the extent 
that customer credit card-specific information is collected by <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>, 
said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other 
than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> reserves the right to share with third parties the fact 
that we have credit card information on file for specific customers but we will not share the 
specific credit card information with third parties without your prior informed consent.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> may employ "cookies" to help customize your access to the 
Website and for the delivery of targeted advertisements.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on a 
your hard drive containing information about you.  Cookies have many benefits to enhance your

further enhance the experience on our Website and for advertising, tracking and/or delivery 
purposes.   To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.  To disable and 
reject cookies, click here.  At no time will we share cookie-related and/or data with third parties.</p>

<p>In addition to cookies, our Website pages and/or e-mails may contain electronic images known 
as "pixel tags" (also knows as clear gifs) to track the pages that visitors and/or members visit at 
the Website for purposes of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used 
in reporting statistics.  </p>

<p>Our Website may also contain pixel tags placed there by third parties to help determine the 
effectiveness of a joint promotional or advertising campaign. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of 
personal information under our control. Currently <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> uses Secure

information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the 
Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution 
available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 
100% secure.  Therefore, <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> cannot warrant that your information 
will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our Website is at your own risk.  
However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.  Our 
employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all 
<a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> user information.  Employees not adhering to our firm policies 
are subject to disciplinary action. </p>

<h5>Minors  </h5>
<p>Individuals under 18 years of age are not permitted to participate in obtaining products and/or 
services at <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a>. No information should be submitted to, or posted 
at, <a href="http://www.cpacoreg.com/">CPACoReg.com</a> by visitors under 18 years of age without the prior consent
