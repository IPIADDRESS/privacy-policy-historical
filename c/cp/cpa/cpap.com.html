To make such a request, please send an email to compliance@cpap.com or write us at: CPAP.com 13235 N.

Your information is protected by administrative, physical and technological security measures. We use many methods in good faith to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access. However, as you may be aware, third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions of your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet, and there is the possibility that users may mistreat or mishandle your personal information that they find or gather during your interactions on the CPAP.com website. Consequently, while we do our best to safeguard your privacy, we in no way guarantee, and you should not have the expectation, that your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet will always remain private. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information in transit to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. </p><p> We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) software, which encrypts personal information you send to Company. </p><p> Email messages are not typically secure so we do not recommend sending us any critical financial information such as credit cards numbers, bank account numbers, or similar information via email. If you choose to provide this type of information via email, you do so at your own risk. </p><p> We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing via a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection which encrypts your data. </p><p> The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards.

Be sure to sign off of your CPAP.com account when finished using a shared computer. </p><h2>Protected Health Information</h2><p> Because we do not electronically submit payment for our products using the HIPAA transaction code sets electronically, we are not required to comply with the federal Health Insurance and Portability Act. However, we believe that information related to your medical care or “Protected Health Information” (PHI) is sensitive and should be protected. For further information about how we use or disclose your Protected Health Information please see Our Protected Health Information Privacy Policy or contact our Privacy Officer, c/o U.S. Expediters, Inc., 13235 N Promenade, Stafford, TX 77477, or email compliance@cpap.com. </p><h2>General</h2><p> We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changes on CPAP.com.
