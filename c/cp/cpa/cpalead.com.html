														To the extent

														remains your property, 
														but by submitting that

														or Third Party 
														Advertisers, you grant 
														CPALead and/or Third

														right to use that

														CPALead or Third Party

														feedback purposes. We 
														may sell the personal

														supply to us and we may 
														join together with other 
														businesses to bring 
														selected retail

														These businesses may 
														include providers of 
														direct marketing 
														services and

														has been used in 
														violation of the Rules 
														or to commit unlawful 
														acts, if the information 
														is subpoenaed, if 
														CPALead is sold or 
														acquired, or when 
														CPALead deems it

														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.3 Third Party 
														List Information</strong><br>
														CPALead collects 
														information from 
														individuals when an 
														individual provides 
														information to a Third 
														Party and CPALead 
														subsequently purchases, 
														licenses, or otherwise 
														acquires the information 
														from the Third Party 
														(the "Seller"). Such 
														purchased information 
														may include, but is not 
														limited to, an 
														individual's name, email 
														address, street address, 
														zip code, telephone 
														numbers (including cell 
														phone numbers and 
														carriers), birth date, 
														gender, salary range, 
														education and marital 
														status, occupation, 
														industry of employment, 
														personal and online 
														interests, and such 
														other information as the 
														individual may have 
														provided to the Seller 
														(together, "Third Party 
														List Information"). When 
														acquiring Third Party 
														List Information, 
														CPALead seeks assurances 
														from the Seller that the 
														Seller has a right to 
														transfer the Third Party 
														List Information to 
														CPALead and that the 
														Seller has a right to 
														provide offers from 
														Advertisers to the 
														individuals whose 
														personal information is 
														included on the Seller's 
														list. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.4 Other 
														Information.</strong><br>
														Other occasions when 
														CPALead obtains 
														information from 
														individuals include (1) 
														when an individual is 
														making a claim for a 
														prize or seeking to 
														redeem an incentive 
														offered by CPALead or by 
														a Third Party, (2) when 
														an individual requests 
														assistance through 
														CPALead's customer 
														service department, (3) 
														when an individual 
														voluntarily subscribes 
														to a service or 
														newsletter; (4) when 
														private information is 
														provided by means of a 
														referral by a third 
														party to CPALead or a 
														Third Party Advertiser 
														(together, "Other 
														Information"). </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.5 Cookies, Web 
														Beacons, and Other Info 
														Collected using 
														Technology.</strong><br>
														CPALead currently uses 
														cookie and web beacon 
														technology to associate 
														certain Internet-related 
														information about an 
														individual with 
														information about the 
														individual in our 
														database. Additionally, 
														CPALead may use other 
														new and evolving sources 
														of information in the 
														future (together, 
														"Technology 
														Information"). <br>
														<strong>a.Cookies.</strong><br>
														A cookie is a small 
														amount of data stored on 
														the hard drive of the 
														individual's computer 
														that allows CPALead to 
														identify the individual 
														with his or her 
														corresponding data that 
														resides in CPALead's 
														database. You may read 
														more about cookies at 
														http://cookiecentral.com. 
														Individuals who use the 
														Websites need to accept 
														cookies in order to use 
														all of the features and 
														functionality of the 
														Websites. <br>
														<strong>a.Web Beacons.</strong><br>
														A web beacon is 
														programming code that 
														can be used to display 
														an image on a web page 
														(by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; 
														programming function -- 
														see http://truste.org 
														for more information), 
														but can also be used to 
														transfer an individual's 
														unique user 
														identification (often in 
														the form of a cookie) to 
														a database and associate 
														the individual with 
														previously acquired 
														information about an 
														individual in a 
														database. This allows 
														CPALead to track certain 
														websites an individual 
														visits online. Web 
														beacons are used to 
														determine products or 
														services an individual 
														may be interested in, 
														and to track online 
														behavioral habits for 
														marketing purposes. For 
														example, CPALead might 
														place, with the consent 
														of a Third Party 
														website, a web beacon on 
														the Third Party's 
														website where cosmetics 
														are sold. When Jane, an 
														individual listed in 
														CPALead's database, 
														visits the cosmetic 
														website, CPALead 
														receives notice by means 
														of the web beacon that 
														Jane visited the 
														cosmetics site, and 
														CPALead would then 
														update Jane's profile 
														with the information 
														that Jane is interested 
														in cosmetics. CPALead 
														may thereafter present 
														offers of cosmetic 
														related products and 
														services to Jane. In 
														addition to using web 
														beacons on web pages, 
														CPALead also uses web 
														beacons in email 
														messages sent to 
														individuals listed in 
														CPALead's database. <br>
														<strong>a.New 
														Technology.</strong><br>
														The use of technology on 
														the Internet, including 
														cookies and web beacons, 
														is rapidly evolving, as 
														is CPALead's use of new 
														and evolving technology. 
														As a result, CPALead 
														strongly encourages 
														individuals to revisit 
														this policy for any 
														updates regarding its 
														use of technology. <br>
														<strong>a.Usage 
														Tracking.</strong><br>
														CPALead tracks 
														information related to 
														the electronic mailings 
														and web pages viewed by 
														users and subscribers, 
														as well as the 
														hyperlinks clicked by 
														subscribers, while 
														viewing our emails or 
														visiting our websites.<br>
														<strong>a.Log Files.</strong><br>
														Log files are used to 
														track and monitor 
														subscriber usage. <br>
														<strong>a.Optional 
														Registration.</strong><br>
														CPALead may offer free 
														voluntary registration 
														to potential 
														subscribers. During such 
														registration, the 
														subscriber is required 
														to supply an email 
														address and other 
														personal information. 
														This information is 
														required if the 
														subscriber wants to 
														participate in Company 
														services or Third Party 
														Services. <br>
														<strong>a.Feedback and 
														Inquiries.</strong><br>
														You have the ability to 
														contact CPALead to 
														provide us with your 
														feedback. CPALead uses 
														this information to 
														respond to you and 
														analyze customer service 
														issues. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.6 Outside 
														Information</strong><br>
														CPALead may receive 
														information about 
														individuals from Third 
														Parties or from other 
														sources of information 
														outside of CPALead 
														including information 
														located in public 
														databases ("Outside 
														Information").</p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.7 Individual 
														Information</strong><br>
														As used herein, 
														Individual Information 
														means Survey 
														Information, Third Party 
														List Information, Other 
														Information, Technology 
														Information, and Outside 
														Information, and any 
														other information 
														CPALead gathers or 
														receives about 
														individuals. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.8 No 
														Information Collected 
														from Children.</strong><br>
														CPALead will never 
														knowingly collect any 
														personal information 
														about children under the 
														age of 18. If CPALead 
														obtains actual knowledge 
														that it has collected 
														personal information 
														about a child under the 
														age of 18, that 
														information will be 
														immediately deleted from 
														our database. Because it 
														does not collect such 
														information, CPALead has 
														no such information to 
														use or to disclose to 
														Third Parties. CPALead 
														has designed this policy 
														in order to comply with 
														the Children's Online 
														Privacy Protection Act 
														("COPPA"). </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.9 Credit Card 
														Information.</strong><br>
														CPALead may in certain 
														cases collect credit 
														card numbers and related 
														information, such as the 
														expiration date of the 
														card ("Credit Card 
														Information") when an 
														individual places an 
														order from CPALead. When 
														the Credit Card 
														Information is submitted 
														to CPALead, such 
														information is encrypted 
														and is protected with 
														SSL encryption software. 
														CPALead will use the 
														Credit Card Information 
														for purposes of 
														processing and 
														completing the purchase 
														transaction, and the 
														Credit Card Information 
														will be disclosed to 
														Third Parties only as 
														necessary to complete 
														the purchase 
														transaction. Although 
														CPALead takes all 
														commercially reasonable 
														action to protect Credit 
														Card Information, you 
														ultimately assume the 
														risk of any damage or 
														loss as a result of 
														transmitting such 
														information to CPALead, 
														including but not 
														limited to, identify 
														theft, credit card fraud 
														or credit card loss. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>1.10 Links to 
														External Websites.</strong><br>
														CPALead's emails and 
														websites contain links 
														to external websites. 
														You will be taken to 
														external websites if you 
														click on these links. 
														Your information may be 
														passed from CPALead's 
														database to the external 
														website, and/or external 
														database, for your 
														convenience (e.g. your 
														information may be used 
														to pre-fill a form at a 
														destination website). 
														CPALead is not 
														responsible for the 
														privacy practices or 
														content of any external 
														website owner. We 
														encourage you to review 
														the privacy policy of 
														any website they visit. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2. Use of 
														Individual Information.</strong></p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.1 Discretion 
														of Information.</strong><br>
														THE COMPANY MAY USE 
														INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION 
														FOR ANY LEGALLY 
														PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN 
														COMPANY'S SOLE 
														DISCRETION. <br>
														The following paragraphs 
														in Section 2 describe 
														how CPALead currently 
														uses Individual 
														Information, but CPALead 
														may change or broaden 
														its use at any time. As 
														noted below, CPALead may 
														update this policy from 
														time to time. CPALead 
														may use Individual 
														Information to provide 
														promotional offers to 
														individuals by means of 
														email advertising, 
														telephone marketing, 
														direct mail marketing, 
														online banner 
														advertising, and package 
														stuffers, among other 
														possible uses. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.2 Email and 
														Unsubscribe Policy.</strong><br>
														CPALead uses Individual 
														Information to provide 
														promotional offers by 
														email to individuals. 
														CPALead may maintain 
														separate email lists for 
														different purposes. If 
														email recipients wish to 
														end their email 
														subscription from a 
														particular list, they 
														need to follow the 
														instructions at the end 
														of each email message to 
														unsubscribe from the 
														particular list. To 
														unsubscribe from all 
														CPALead's email lists, a 
														person must send an 
														email to 
														network@cpalead.com. <br>
														CPALead's unsubscribe 
														process impacts only the 
														future delivery of 
														electronic mailings 
														disseminated by CPALead 
														on its own behalf. You 
														may still receive 
														electronic mailings sent 
														on behalf of Third 
														Parties and your 
														personal information may 
														still be shared with 
														Third Parties for use in 
														offline marketing and 
														data appends, including 
														email appends. <br>
														You should also note 
														that unsubscribing from 
														CPALead's electronic 
														mailings will not 
														automatically 
														unsubscribe the 
														subscriber's information 
														from any Third Party 
														associates and licensees 
														of the data. Since Third 
														Party associates and 
														licensee partners 
														maintain separate 
														databases from CPALead, 
														and you will need to 
														unsubscribe from each 
														source individually, if 
														desired. This allows you 
														the freedom to pick and 
														choose which 
														subscriptions to 
														maintain and which to 
														discontinue. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.3 Content of 
														Email Messages.</strong><br>
														In certain commercial 
														email messages sent by 
														CPALead, an Advertiser's 
														name will appear in the 
														"From:" line but hitting 
														the "Reply" button will 
														cause a reply email to 
														be sent to CPALead. The 
														"Subject:" line of 
														CPALead email messages 
														will usually contain a 
														line provided from the 
														Advertiser to CPALead. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.4 Solicited 
														Email.</strong><br>
														CPALead only sends email 
														to individuals who have 
														agreed on the Websites 
														to receive email from 
														CPALead or to 
														individuals who have 
														agreed on Third Party 
														websites to receive 
														email from Third 
														Parties. As such CPALead 
														does not send 
														unsolicited email 
														messages. As a result, 
														statutes requiring 
														certain formatting for 
														unsolicited email are 
														not applicable to 
														CPALead's email 
														messages. </p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.5 Targeted 
														Advertising.</strong><br>
														CPALead uses Individual 
														Information to target 
														advertising to an 
														individual. When an 
														individual is using the 
														Internet, CPALead uses 
														Technology Information 
														(see also Section 2.7 
														below) to associate an 
														individual with that 
														person's Individual 
														Information, and CPALead 
														attempts to show 
														advertising for products 
														and services in which 
														the person has expressed 
														an interest in the 
														Surveys, indicated an 
														interest by means of 
														Technology Information, 
														and otherwise. CPALead 
														may, at its discretion, 
														target advertising by 
														using email, direct 
														mail, telephones, cell 
														phones, and other means 
														of communication to 
														provide promotional 
														offers.</p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.6 Direct Mail 
														and Telemarketing.</strong><br>
														CPALead uses Individual 
														Information to

														telemarketing using 
														telephones and cell 
														phones.</p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.7 Use of

														Information (1) to match 
														a person's Survey 
														Information and Third 
														Party List Information 
														to other categories of 
														Individual Information 
														to make and improve 
														profiles of individuals, 
														(2) to track a person's 
														online browsing habits 
														on the Internet, (3) to 
														determine which areas of 
														CPALead's websites are 
														most frequently visited. 
														This information helps 
														CPALead to better 
														understand the online 
														habits of individuals so 
														that CPALead can target 
														advertising and 
														promotions to them.</p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.8 Profiles of 
														Individuals.</strong><br>
														CPALead uses Individual 
														Information to make a 
														profile of an 
														individual. A profile 
														can be created by 
														combining Survey 
														Information and Third 
														Party List Information 
														with other sources of 
														Individual Information 
														such as behavioral and 
														other information 
														obtained from public 
														databases. CPALead may 
														also publish personal 
														information in the form 
														of a testimonial if such 
														information is sent to 
														CPALead by you.</p>
														<p class="style15">
														<strong>2.9 Storage of 
														Individual Information.</strong><br>
														CPALead stores the 
														Individual Information 
														in a database on our 
														computers. Our computers 
														have security measures 
														(such as a firewall) in 
														place to protect against 
														the loss, misuse, and 
														alteration of the 
														information under 
														CPALead's control. Not 
														withstanding such 
														measures, CPALead cannot 
														guarantee that its 
														security measures will 
														prevent our computers 
														from being illegally 
														accessed, and the 
														Individual Information 
														on them stolen or 
														altered.</p>

														of Individual 
														Information.</strong></p>
														<p class="style15">
