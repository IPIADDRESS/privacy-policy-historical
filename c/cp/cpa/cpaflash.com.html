                   <p><strong>Company Practices <br>
                   </strong> The following statement describes the overall company practices of   Revenue Vision LLC., including advertising on our network of websites,   as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that   are offered by Revenue Vision LLC. This policy does not apply to the   practices of companies that Revenue Vision LLC does not own or control,   or to people that Revenue Vision LLC does not employ. </p>

                   </p>
                   <p><strong>Information Collected by Revenue Vision LLC </strong></p>
                   <p>&nbsp; </p>
                   <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data <br>
                   </strong> Revenue Vision LLC delivers advertisements across multiple channels   and media, including to web surfers who visit any of the thousands of   websites that are a part of Revenue Vision LLC 's network. With respect   to individuals who visit those sites, we, and/or one or more of our   third party advertising technology vendors, may collect what is known as   "Click Stream Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes   information such as a web surfer's IP address, web pages which have been   viewed by a web surfer, date and time, domain type, and responses by a   web surfer to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party   advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising   technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect   this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1   pixels). (Please refer to the FAQ section for more details). In addition   to the Click Stream Data collected across our web network, Revenue   Vision LLC owns numerous websites and services, and often runs   promotions and sweepstakes offers through various Internet channels   (collectively referred to as "Revenuevision.llc Properties"), and   collects information at those sites. As a part of the registration   process at the Revenue Vision LLC Properties, we may request and collect   additional non-personally identifiable information about the visitor.   Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested   include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information   (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by   itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific   individual. Web surfers may elect not to provide Click Stream Data by   following the Cookie Opt-Out procedures set forth below. In addition,   web surfers who have provided registration data to Revenuevision.llc may   elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from being   used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the   Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below. Personally identifiable   information that is collected at the Revenue Vision LLC Properties is   discussed immediately below. </p>
                   <p><br>
                   </p>
                   <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Consumer Data <br>
                     </strong> At some of the Revenue Vision LLC Properties, we ask people to   register and provide personally identifiable data. Revenue Vision LLC is   committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to   all consumers before the personally identifiable data is collected, and   that they have opted-in to our use of their data. Examples of personally   identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, and   email address. Web surfers who have provided personally identifiable   data may elect to have their data deleted from our files, or kept from   being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by   following the Data Opt-Out procedures set forth below. <br>
                   </p>
                   <p>&nbsp; </p>
                   <p><strong>Other Information that is Collected <br>
                     </strong> At some Revenuevision.llc Properties, including this one, Revenue   Vision LLC collects personal information on individuals and companies   who want to enter into business relationships with Revenuevision.llc   ("business information"). An example of this would include web   publishers who want to become a part of Revenue Vision LLC 's web   network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering   the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments,   etc. We may share business information with third parties who provide   administrative services (and they are required to maintain the   confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court   order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary   or appropriate. <br>
                   </p>
                   <p>&nbsp; </p>
                   <p><strong>How Collected Information is Used <br>
                     </strong> The non-personally identifiable data that Revenue Vision LLC and/or   its third party advertising technology vendors collect are used for   marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements to people   across the different websites they visit. Revenue Vision LLC may also   use the non-personally identifiable data to better target content to   individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for   each person. The data are also used to predict responses to   advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which   content is most appropriate for different individuals. If a consumer   elects to provide Revenue Vision LLC with personally identifiable data,   we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data   may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist   with targeting ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for   other Revenuevision.llc sales and marketing efforts. <br>
                   </p>
                   <p>&nbsp; </p>
                   <p><strong>Sharing With Third Parties <br>
                     </strong> All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained   in confidence by Revenue Vision LLC. There are instances, however, in   which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable   information is shared with third parties, as described below. The   non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners   of Revenue Vision LLC on an anonymous basis. <br>
                     <br>
                     With respect to personally identifiable information, Revenue Vision   LLC may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party   administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing   administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for   other services related to providing an Revenuevision.llc product or   service. Any third-party vendor so used will be required to enter into a   confidentiality agreement with Revenue Vision LLC. <br>
  <br>
                     Revenue Vision LLC may also share personally identifiable information   with third parties who enter into business relationships with us. These   business partners may include financial service providers (including   credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including   retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors,   direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing   services on our behalf, and others such as non-profit organizations. We   may also disclose information to a third party who provides   substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if   we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such   situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to   opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Revenue Vision LLC is very   careful about which companies it does business with. <br>
  <br>
                     In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that Revenue   Vision LLC, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or   merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or   merging) company will have access to your information. Finally, Revenue   Vision LLC may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to   comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law   enforcement officials. <br>
