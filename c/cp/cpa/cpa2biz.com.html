<h6>1. OUR COMMITMENT</h6>
<p>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), CPA2Biz, and Shared Services Limited Liability Company (SSLLC) understand how important the protection of your personal information is to you. We are committed to protecting your privacy. We want to make sure you understand how the personal information you provide to us is being used as well as the choices that you have regarding this information. The following policy discloses our procedures surrounding this commitment.&nbsp; 
</p>
<h6>2. ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW</h6>
<p>The AICPA is the premier national professional association for CPAs in the United States. Committed to member service and the public interest, the AICPA and its predecessors have been serving the accounting profession since 1887. The AICPA operates a Web domain under the URL <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.aicpa.org/</a> and has many Web destinations that link from this Web URL.</p>
<p>CPA2Biz is a separate, for-profit corporation. The AICPA has a partnership with CPA2Biz that calls for CPA2Biz to act as the exclusive online and offline marketing agent for AICPA products and services. In addition, through online and offline activities, CPA2Biz acts as a marketing and distribution agent for other third parties. <sup><a href="#sup1">1</a></sup> CPA2Biz also provides marketing and technology services to the AICPA for its wide array of products and services, such as continuing education, conferences, and literature to enhance CPAs' abilities to fulfill their professional needs. The CPA2Biz Web domain (sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as the CPA2Biz Site) is under the URL <a href="http://www.cpa2biz.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cpa2biz.com/</a>.<sup><a href="#sup2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>SSLLC is a 50/50 joint venture between the AICPA and the 50 state CPA societies, plus the CPA societies of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. SSLLC was established in 2000 and is a separate, for-profit, legal entity.  SSLLC negotiates agreements with service providers that allow the state CPA societies and the AICPA to reduce aggregate operating costs by securing savings on purchases and/or services by leveraging the collective buying power of its stakeholders and their members. SSLLC activities are conducted both online and offline. Related online activities result from activities connected to strategic sourcing providers.  The customers and related parties of SSLLC include the AICPA, CPA2Biz, and the state CPA societies (henceforth referred to as the Entities).</p>
<p>The AICPA, CPA2Biz and SSLLC are henceforth called the Organizations.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2003, the AICPA launched Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Human Resources Management System (HRMS) systems; hosted by a third-party hosting and application support provider. The member and other database information stored in the ERP, CRM and HRMS system can be collected and viewed by the AICPA and CPA2Biz </p>

<p>a.&nbsp;CPA2Biz will perform research on our end users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information we collect, for example, during registration, from our server log files, and from user surveys.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;If you are a member of the AICPA, CPA2Biz shares all the information collected about you, either as a result of your use of the Site or otherwise, with the AICPA and SSLLC.&nbsp; CPA2Biz will not disclose this information to any third parties unless the third party enters into a confidentiality agreement with CPA2Biz.

<p>(i)&nbsp;The AICPA does not disclose any individually identifiable purchase information or any personally &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identifying information about the member</p>

<p>(iii)&nbsp;The AICPA assumes responsibility for operation of the Site from CPA2Biz and disclosure is required in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order to operate the Site.

In addition, CPA2Biz will transmit your User ID to the AICPA so, in the future, if you elect to become a member of the AICPA, your User ID on the CPA2Biz Site will be available to you for use as a User ID on the AICPA Web site.

<p>d.&nbsp;CPA2Biz and the AICPA share Email and Web site usage information about visitors to the Site who have received a targeted e-mail promotional campaign from us with a third-party advertising company, Epsilon Interactive, for the sole purpose of targeting future e-mail campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, CPA2Biz and Epsilon Interactive track some of the pages you visit on our Web site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). This information is not shared with any third parties other than Epsilon Interactive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;CPA2Biz allows third parties to provide Site features and services. These third parties are prohibited from using personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;Our contractors, consultants, and professional advisers provide a service to us. For example, from time to time CPA2Biz may use third parties to help us collect information about our users. In those cases, CPA2Biz would prohibit the third parties from using the information they collect for any purpose other than providing the service to us </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;CPA2Biz will disclose personally identifiable information as we believe necessary to comply with the law and protect the rights, property, or safety of others </p>

</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp;With your consent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.&nbsp;To facilitate a transaction or communication with a third party that you initiate. For example, we will provide your information, including credit card information, to the third parties from whom you purchase services through this Site. Those parties' use of your information is subject to their privacy practices and agreement with you. </p>

<p>b.&nbsp;When it is inherent in the function you use on the Site, such as posting to a discussion area where your e-mail address automatically appears. </p></blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp;Supplementing of Information:&nbsp; </p>
<p>To provide better service to you on the Site, we may conclude it is necessary for us to supplement the information you provide us with information from third-party sources, which would require disclosure of your personally identifiable information to such third parties. </p>

<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a.&nbsp;If, when you register, you tell us that you are an AICPA member, we will verify that fact with membership information provided to us by the AICPA. </p>

<p>b.&nbsp;We may, from time to time, purchase third-party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in. We might use this information to enhance or overlay the "profile" of individual users, linking the supplemental information with your personally identifiable information.
</p></blockquote>

<p>AICPA members should understand that CPA2Biz acts as the AICPA's agent in a number of capacities that are governed by these privacy practices. For example, CPA2Biz may act as the AICPA's agent in the rental of certain member information to third parties. The rental is governed by the AICPA's privacy procedures, if different from those of CPA2Biz. Similarly, CPA2Biz may transmit to certain affinity partners of the AICPA certain information provided by the AICPA which may overlap with personal information you have also provided to CPA2Biz directly.  This information would be shared with affinity partners of the AICPA so they can provide you with special offers. The transmission of this data to the affinity partners is subject to the AICPA's privacy practices as well.  </p>
<p>The AICPA is able to view all the information collected about you in connection with the sale to you of any product sold on the portion of this Site targeted to CPAs. This includes transmission of your User ID to the AICPA so, in the future, if you elect to become a member of the AICPA, your User ID on the CPA2Biz Site will be available to you for use as a User ID on the AICPA Web site. </p>
<p>We do not currently sell e-mail addresses to any third party. Consistent with the AICPA’s historical practice, we do rent mailing address lists for one-time use per list purchase only to companies and organizations that offer products or services of interest to CPAs, other accountants, and business and financial executives. The products or services offered in the mail campaign must be relevant to a business environment.</p>
