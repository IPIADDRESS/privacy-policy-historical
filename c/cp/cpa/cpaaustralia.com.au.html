      <h1> Privacy statement</h1>
      <h2><br>
        Background</h2>
      <p>From 21 December 2001, the Privacy Act 1988 ('the Act') has extended 
        to private sector organisations, including CPA Australia (ABN 64 008 392 
        452) ('CPA'). The Act requires private sector organisations like us to 
        comply with 10 National Privacy Principles (NPPs). The NPPs establish 
        minimum standards in relation to the collection, holding, use disclosure, 
        management, access, correction and disposal of Personal Information about 
        natural persons. For a summary of the NPPs, <a href="/11_business_tools/14_privacy/11_14_0_17_npps.asp">click 
        here</a>.</p>
      <h2><br>
        Scope</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Statement applies to this website which is operated by CPA 
        Australia under the domain name www.cpaonline.com.au ('the CPA website'). 
        However this Privacy Statement is subject to any specific provisions about 
        privacy that may be contained in other sections of the CPA website. In 
        the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy 
        Statement and such other specific provisions, the latter shall prevail.</p>
      <h2><br>
        Commitment</h2>
      <p>CPA is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Personal Information 
        collected about you. This Privacy Statement explains how the Personal 
        Information collected about you online will be handled by us.</p>
      <p>From time to time we may amend information provided on this website, 
        including this Privacy Statement. Consequently you are encouraged to visit 
        the CPA website and this Privacy Statement on a regular basis.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>By visiting the CPA website, you are accepting the practices described 
        in this Privacy Statement.</b> </p>
      <h2><br>
        Personal Information</h2>
      <p>'Personal Information' means information or an opinion about an individual 
        whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information. 
      </p>
      <h2><br>
        Collection of personal information</h2>
      <p>The type of Personal Information that CPA collects about you online, 
        depends on how you use the CPA website. For example, we will collect Personal 
        Information about you if you register with CPA as a member; register with 
        CPA Online to use the PD Online service or enrol into an event online; 
        enrol in CPA Program and/or Public Practice Program, order a product; 
        post messages to forums; publish resumes; publish jobs or set up a job 
        alert in Recruitment and Careers; participate in a discussion group; communicate 
        to us via e-mail; or volunteer survey information.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking, the purpose of collection and the minimum information 
        which you must provide us, will be conveyed to you at the time of collection.<br>
      </p>
      <h2><br>
        Collection of information that is not personal information</h2>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to your browser 
        for identification purposes. CPA may send cookies to your computer while 
        you are accessing the CPA website.</p>
      <p>Cookies are used on the CPA website:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to reduce the need for members to re-enter their member ID and password 
          during visits to the CPA website;<br>
        </li>
        <li>for internal review; and</li>
        <li>to track progress through PD Online e-learning modules.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>CPA reserves the right to collect Personal Information through the use 
        of cookies in the future. If we do so, we will amend this Privacy Statement 
        to advise users that CPA is collecting Personal Information in this way, 
        and the purposes for which that Personal Information will be used.</p>
      <p>In the future, CPA may give third parties the ability to assign cookies 
        to users of the CPA website, for example, as part of an arrangement for 
        the CPA website to carry advertisements for other websites. If this occurs, 
        we will amend this Privacy Statement to advise users of the type of information 
        that such cookies collect, as well as the use to which such information 
        will be put.</p>
      <h3>Browser details</h3>
      <p>A user's Browser details are collected by CPA for statistical purposes.</p>

        </li>
        <li>when otherwise permitted by the Act.</li>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>We use industry standard encryption technologies (such as Secure Sockets 
        Layer (SSL) technology) when transferring and receiving data through CPA 
        Online. SSL is compatible with Netscape, Internet Explorer, AOL, Web TV 
        and most other browsers. If your browser is not equipped with SSL, or 
        if you are at all concerned about sending information such as credit card 
        details over the Internet, we encourage you to contact your local CPA 
        office to make alternative arrangements.</p>
      <p>We take reasonable steps to protect Personal Information from misuse 
        and loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Our personnel 
        are trained to treat Personal Information with the utmost confidentiality. 
        You can help by ensuring that you log out of the CPA Online website when 
        you have finished using it. If you become aware of any security breach, 
        please let us know as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Although CPA takes reasonable steps to protect Personal Information, 
        we cannot guarantee that the CPA Online website is 'hacker-proof'.</p>
      <p>When Personal Information is no longer required, reasonable steps are 
        taken to destroy or permanently de-identify the information. <br>
      </p>
      <h2><br>
