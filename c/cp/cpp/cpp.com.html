  <h1>Consent</h1>
  <p>By creating an account, using the Site, and/or submitting Personal Information to us, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you agree that we may collect, use, disclose, store, transmit, and/or process such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as required by law.</p>
  <p>If you reside in a country or territory that restricts the transfer of Personal Information out of that country or territory, you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your Personal Information to countries that may not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection as those that exist in your country of residence.</p>
  <p>Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Site without their parents’ or guardians’ consent.&nbsp; Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send Personal Information directly to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him/her that we must have parental consent before receiving his/her Personal Information.</p>
  <p>If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, we will promptly remove such Personal Information from our files.&nbsp; If the parent or guardian of a minor becomes aware that his/her child has provided us with Personal Information without his/her consent, he/she should contact as as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Links to External Sites</h1>
  <p>This Site may link to websites that are operated by third parties.&nbsp; Because such websites are not operated by CPP, they are not subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We recommend that you read the privacy statements that are posted on these third-party websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>What Personal Information We Collect and How</h1>
  <p>We collect only such Personal Information as necessary to (i) provide our Products or Services to you; (ii) inform you about our Products and Services; (iii) continue our research in the field; and (iv) improve our Site, Products or Services, and your experience interacting with us.&nbsp; We describe below the different ways in which we collect or obtain Personal Information.</p>
  <p><strong>If you visit the Site </strong>-- If you visit the Site, we automatically collect the related Session Data.&nbsp; Session Data is provided to us by your browser and through our log files, which record your activities while browsing our Site, such as when you click on a link.&nbsp; We may record some of this data in one or several cookies that we send to your browser (see “Cookies and Other Technologies”).</p>
  <p><strong>If you register or create an account </strong>-- If you register or create an account, we require that you provide certain Personal Information during account registration.&nbsp; We collect your name, contact information, and other information, and may ask you for other optional information that helps us serve you better.</p>
  <p><strong>If you complete an Assessment </strong>-- If a Respondent completes an Assessment, we collect the Respondent’s name, email address, contact information, Assessment responses, Session Data, and other information you may choose to provide or associate with your account.&nbsp; In some cases, we ask questions to which the response is optional (such as demographic questions), and these questions are identified as such.&nbsp; You are free not to respond to these optional questions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>If you participate in a survey </strong>-- If you choose to participate in one of our surveys, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and any other Personal Information that you may provide in your survey responses.</p>
  <p><strong>If you sign up to receive marketing communications </strong>-- If you sign up to receive our marketing communications, we may collect information on the open rate of the communications, and whether a specific individual has clicked on a link contained in a particular communication.</p>
  <p><strong>If you are a Customer or other business contact </strong>-- If you are a Customer or other business contact, or if you are an employee or agent of a Customer or business contact, we may collect your name, email address, telephone number, and contact information in the regular course of our interaction with you.</p>
  <p><strong>If you interact with third parties regarding our Products or Services </strong>-- We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such as from Customers, websites where we advertise, business partners, and service providers.&nbsp; Some of this information pertains to a specific individual; other information can only be linked to an access point or a device.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>How We Use Personal Information</h1>
  <p>We use Personal Information in order to provide and enhance the Products or Services that we offer as explained below:</p>
  <p><strong>To facilitate the use of the Site</strong> -- We use Session Data to ease navigation throughout the Site, to enhance navigation, keep track of login name and password in order to avoid requesting identity information when the visitor moves from page to page, and in general to enhance the quality of our Site and the content provided on the Site.</p>
  <p><strong>In connection with Assessments </strong>-- We use the responses to an Assessment to score the Assessment and to generate Reports and other data related to the Respondent.&nbsp; We sometimes combine data from multiple Respondents (for example, in Team Reports).&nbsp; We may also combine Respondent data with our general research data, or compare or associate Respondent data with other Respondent data.&nbsp; Certain subsets of this data are made available to our Customers, but your Personal Information is only shared with our Customers if (i) you have elected to do so using the features made available on the Site; or (ii) you complete an Assessment that has been sponsored by a Customer.</p>
  <p><strong>For research purposes </strong>-- We may use aggregated Session Data to better understand how our Site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, which pages or content attract more viewers, the length and frequency of stays at our Site, the different types of searches of our Site content and databases, the types of browsers and computer operating systems that our visitors use, and the IP addresses from which visitors connect to our Site, in order to improve our Site and enhance our content.&nbsp; We may use IP addresses to gather broad demographic information—information that is not associated with any individual, and is therefore anonymous.&nbsp; We also use aggregated Assessment responses and other data to improve our Products and Services.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>For maintenance purposes </strong>-- We may use IP addresses and Session Data to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site.</p>
  <p><strong>For marketing purposes </strong>-- We may use email addresses or other contact information to send mailings, newsletters, and other marketing communications regarding product information and releases.&nbsp; We may use your telephone number to contact you for marketing purposes.&nbsp; We may use pixel tags to monitor the open rate of our communications.&nbsp; This helps us understand the effectiveness of the communications that we send.</p>
  <p><strong>For survey analysis </strong>-- The information that we collect through our surveys is not used other than to garner survey results and statistical analysis.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>To Whom We Disclose Personal Information</h1>
  <p>From time to time, we may disclose Personal Information to someone other than the individual who provided the information as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>Customers </strong>-- CPP provides its Customers with the information that they need to properly complete or interpret Assessments.&nbsp; If you take an Assessment at the direction of one of our Customers, that Customer will receive from CPP a Report or Reports based on the Assessment you took and the responses you provided to that Assessment so that the Customer may properly counsel or advise you or provide you with other services.&nbsp; If you purchase Products or Services for use by another individual (for example, as a gift), then we may provide the recipient of such Products or Services with your Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Service providers </strong>-- We may engage certain third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, customer relationship management, contract management, order fulfillment, mass mailing, hosting and maintenance, database storage and management, business analytics, and direct marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Pursuant to written agreements between CPP and these service providers, each of these service providers only has access to such Personal Information as necessary to fulfill its obligation to CPP, is not permitted to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those directed by CPP, and is required to act in a manner consistent with the privacy principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p><strong>Foreign Distributors</strong> -- We may provide Personal Information to our distributors in foreign markets.&nbsp; We only do so when we believe that providing such information will permit us to improve the Products or Services provided to Customers in that distributor’s territory, and only when the distributor’s use of such Personal Information is in accordance with the privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p><strong>The Public</strong> -- If you are or become a Certified Practitioner, we may share information regarding your certification, such as your name, the instruments in which you are certified/qualified, the date(s) of your certification/qualification, and the current status of your certification/qualification with the public.&nbsp; In addition, certain Sites offer publicly-accessible blogs or community forums and any Personal Information you provide on these blogs or forums may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>Complaints and Disputes</h1>
  <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, you should first contact us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If our efforts to resolve your complaint through CPP’s internal dispute resolution mechanisms are unsatisfactory, you agree to first attempt to settle in good faith the dispute through mediation administered by JAMS, under its International Mediation Rules, which are accessible on the JAMS website at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/international-mediation-rules/">http://www.jamsadr.com/international-mediation-rules/</a>.&nbsp; The mediator may propose any appropriate remedy, such as publicity for findings of non-compliance, payment of compensation for losses incurred as a result of non-compliance, or cessation of processing of the Personal Information who has brought the complaint.&nbsp; The mediation will be held online and all documents and other correspondence will be transmitted through email.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If our efforts to resolve the dispute through mediation are unsuccessful, you agree to binding arbitration administered by JAMS pursuant to its International Arbitration Rules, which are accessible on the JAMS website at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/international-arbitration-rules/">http://www.jamsadr.com/international-arbitration-rules/</a>.&nbsp; Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered into any court having jurisdiction over the matter.&nbsp; The arbitration will be held online and all documents and other correspondence will be transmitted through email.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>EU Citizens may also direct complaints to local Data Protection Authorities or to the Ombudsperson designated by the U.S. government, which work with the Federal Trade Commission in the United States to resolve complaints. CPP is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Under certain conditions, EU Citizens may invoke binding arbitration by a Privacy Shield panel, as outlined in Annex I of the Privacy Shield Framework.  More information is available at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
