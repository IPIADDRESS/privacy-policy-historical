                            some cases be linked to personally identifiable information. We use the tracked

                            Our Web site uses an order form for customers to purchase products and services.
                            We collect customers' contact information (such as their name, address, and e-mail
                            address) and financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers).
                            We verify our customer-provided credit card information with a third party prior
                            to order processing.

                            Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers.
                            We also provide mailings and other marketing collateral regarding product information
                            and releases. We also conduct surveys during which non-personally identifiable information
                            is collected. This information will not be used other than to garner survey results.
                            Users may opt out of receiving any of the surveys by contacting CPP by e-mail, mail,
                            or phone as noted above or by selecting the appropriate option during account setup
                            or modification once they are logged into their account. We reserve the right to

                            CPP collects the name and e-mail address of the end user (the assessment taker)
                            for the sole purpose of providing CPP’s customers with assessment results. CPP does
                            not share this information with any third parties (other than the test administrator).

                            using industry-standard SSL encryption. SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer, a

                            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information

                            <br>
                            CPP recognizes the importance of children's safety and privacy on the Internet.
                            For that reason, and in compliance with applicable laws, we do not intentionally
                            collect personally identifiable information from, nor do we offer any content targeted
                            to children. We ask that children under the age of thirteen do not use our web site,
                            as it is not targeted to children.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>WILL CPP DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?</strong>
                            <br>
                            We do not share, sell, trade, or rent or otherwise give to any other entity or organization
                            the individual information our customers submit when placing an order or taking
                            an instrument on our sites except as noted in this privacy policy. CPP does provide
                            its customers with the individual information they need to properly counsel or advise
                            their clients. In other words, if you are taking an instrument on our site at the
                            direction of a consultant, counselor, or other individual, that consultant, counselor,
                            or other individual will receive, from CPP, individually identifiable information
                            so that he or she may properly counsel or advise you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From time to time, CPP will provide its approved distributors in international markets
                            with a list of customers, including name and contact information, residing in that
                            distributor’s CPP-approved area of distribution. CPP will do so only when it reasonably
                            believes that providing such information will permit improved service to CPP customers
                            in that distributor’s area, and only when the distributor’s use of such information
                            is in accordance with CPP’s privacy policies in general.
                        </p>

CPP has entered into a strategic alliance with ThinkWise, Inc. in order to provide Myers-Briggs® ThinkBox, CPP’s learning on demand portal to its customers.  ThinkWise has signed an agreement obligating it to abide by this Privacy Policy.  From time to time, CPP and ThinkWise may share your information to better market this solution to CPP customers.  CPP will also, by necessity, provide ThinkWise with customer information when customers have purchased licenses to Myers-Briggs® ThinkBox so that ThinkWise can support that purchase.</p>
    <p>CPP uses Salesforce.com for customer relationship management.  We provide customer data to salesforce.com so that it can provide us with customer relationship management services.  Salesforce.com does not use personally identifiable information for any purposes other than those directed by CPP, Inc.</p>                    
<p>
                            We use outside shipping companies to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing
                            company to bill you for goods and services. Similarly, from time to time CPP uses
                            third-party vendors to assist in the preparation and mailing of its marketing materials.
                            These companies do not use personally identifiable information for any purposes
                            other than those directed by CPP, Inc.

                            If a customer neglects to pay amounts due and owing to CPP, CPP may send that CPP
                            customer’s name, contact information, and account information to a third-party vendor
                            for collection of overdue payments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other than as stated above, if CPP provides a third party with client information,
                            it will be in the form of aggregate data and used for the purposes of product development,
                            research, or statistical analysis. The information will remain anonymous, stripped
                            of all personally identifiable data, and compiled among all of our visitors' answers
                            to survey questions and instrument responses as well as grouped on-site behavior.
                            Again, all identifiable individual information will be removed.

                            by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or
                            comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web
                            sites.

                        <p>
                            CPP may release account information when it believes, in good faith, that such release
                            is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law; (ii) enforce or apply the terms
                            of any of its user agreements; or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety
