<h2 id="Cookies">3. What "Cookies" Are and How They Are Used</h2>
<p>"Cookies" are simple text files that web browsers place on computer hard drives when sites are visited. Cookies cannot damage files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. The cookie, by itself, doesn't tell us your email address or who you are. When you participate in our activities, we do not store any personal information within cookies, nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information submitted online. This website uses cookies to help us measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics relating to use of our sites. As a convenience for users, this website also uses cookies to remember non-personally identifiable user-names so that the need for multiple log-ins is eliminated.</p>
<p>Please note certain features on our sites may not function if you do not accept cookies.</p>
<p>Log data collected on web servers supplies us with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. This website uses such aggregate information to improve access to content based on visitors' browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many visitors as possible. We do not link the log data collected to any personal information submitted online.</p>

<h2 id="ShareInfo">4. With Whom Your Information Is Shared</h2>
<p>In some instances, we use outside parties to administer contests, promotions and other online activities on our behalf. This may involve the collection of personal information. In such cases, we ensure that the way in which any outside party collects and retains personal information conforms to our privacy regime.</p>
<p>There may also be instances in which we are required by law to provide personal information without your consent. Such instances include emergency situations, or where required by governmental or other legal order.</p>
<p>Other than as indicated above, we will not sell, rent, share or otherwise make available your personal information to any outside parties without your consent. In such a case, we will tell you for what purpose such information will be disclosed and we will ask for your consent to "opt-in". If you want to share your personal information, you will have to respond affirmatively. If you do not respond, by default, we will assume that you do not want to be involved and your information will not be sold, rented, shared with or otherwise made available to outside parties.</p>
