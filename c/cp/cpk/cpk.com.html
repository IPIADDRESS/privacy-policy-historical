                                      is committed to treating the personal and 
                                      corporate information of our users with 
                                      respect and sensitivity. Our privacy commitment 
                                      is described in this Privacy Policy. As 
                                      our services evolve and we perceive the 
                                      need or desirability of using information 
                                      collected in other ways, we may from time

                                          <p><b>General Information</b></p>
                                          <p>1. We believe that you have the right to 
                                      understand how your information is stored 
                                      and used. We require that sites linked to 
                                      our Site contain a notice identifying their 
                                      privacy policies.</p>
                                          <p>2. You may have provided us with certain 
                                      registration information, including personal 
                                      identifying information ("PII"). 
                                      We do not disclose PII to third parties 
                                      except where we have so informed you or 
                                      as required by law. Our employees and contractors 
                                      may have access to personal identifying 
                                      information maintained on our system, but 
                                      all are required to keep it confidential 
                                      and to use it only as necessary to perform 
                                      their responsibilities. From time to time, 
                                      we may allow access to "co-branded" 
                                      pages on our Site - pages that are presented 
                                      to you jointly by CPK and another entity. 
                                      We will try always to indicate clearly, 
                                      through prominent placement of that entity's 
                                      name or logo or otherwise, whether a page 
                                      is co-branded. If you provide your information 
                                      on a co-branded page, your information may 
                                      be provided to our co-branded partner, as 
                                      well. In that event, the use and disclosure 
                                      of that information will be governed by 
                                      that partner's privacy policy. We require 
                                      that all of our co-branding partners maintain 
                                      their own privacy policies on their sites.</p>
                                          <p>3. You have the right, upon reasonable 
                                      notice, to view your registration information 
                                      and make any corrections that are necessary. 
                                      You also have the right, subject to otherwise 
                                      applicable law to request that your registration 
                                      information be removed from our system upon 
                                      termination of your registration.</p>
                                          <p>4. We encourage parents and guardians to 
                                      spend time online with their children and 
                                      to participate in the activities offered 
                                      on the Site. No information, including information 
                                      for registration in our CPKids program, 
                                      should be submitted to or posted at CPK 
                                      by users under 13 years of age without the 
                                      consent of their parent or guardian.</p>
                                          <p>Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, 
                                      we do not provide any personally identifying 
                                      information, regardless of its source, to 
                                      any third party for any purpose whatsoever 
                                      from our users under 13 years of age. All 
                                      registrants receive an e-mail confirming 
                                      their registration. In addition, when a 
                                      user under 13 registers, he/she is required 
                                      to provide the e-mail address of his/her 
                                      parent or guardian and that parent or guardian 
                                      receives an e-mail alerting them to that 
                                      registration. In order for the potential 
                                      user to receive any information from us, 
                                      the parent or guardian must validate the 
                                      registration, as described in the e-mail. 
                                      No information collected from users under 
                                      13 years of age is used for any marketing 
                                      or promotional purposes whatsoever, either 
                                      inside or outside CPK except as explicitly 
                                      stated during registration for each user's 
                                      participation in the CPKids program.</p>
                                          <p>Although users under 13 years of age may 
                                      be allowed to participate in some contests 
                                      and promotions, if such a user wins, notification 
                                      and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian 
                                      identified in the initial registration process. 
                                      Publication of names, ages, or images for 
                                      contest winners under 13 require parental 
                                      or guardian consent.</p>
                                          <p>We currently give all users, including 
                                      children, the option to send "electronic 
                                      postcards" to their friends. We ask 
                                      each user to submit their friends' email 
                                      addresses, their own email address, and 
                                      their first name. We only use this information 
                                      to send the postcard and do not include 
                                      the sender's email address in the postcard. 
                                      Both the friends' email addresses and the 
                                      sender's email address are deleted from 
                                      our system within 10 minutes.</p>
                                          <p>Teens between the ages of 13 and 17 are 
                                      required to provide the e-mail address of 
                                      a parent or guardian and a notification 
                                      message is sent to the parent or guardian 
                                      of all users who are 13 to 17 years of age, 
                                      which identifies the information supplied 
                                      upon registration and allows the parent 
                                      or guardian to be aware of and participate 
                                      in the user's online experience.</p>

                                      for you and to collect aggregate information

                                      cookie is a text file that our Site transfers

                                      purposes and to enhance the quality of your
