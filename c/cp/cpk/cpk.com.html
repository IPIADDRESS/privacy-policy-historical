		<div class="intro">
			<p><strong>Last Updated: April 2013</strong></p>
			<p>
				California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. and its affiliates (“we,” “us” or “our”) care about your privacy and treats the personal information of our customers with respect and sensitivity.

 Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe how we collect and use information from you. As our services evolve and we perceive the need or desirability of using information collected in other ways, we may from time to time amend this Privacy Policy. We post the effective date of our Privacy Policy on our website ("Site") and in the profile for mobile applications. We encourage you to check our Site frequently to see the current Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect and any changes that may have been made to them. If we make material changes to this Policy we will post the revised Policy and the revised effective date on this Site. Please check back here periodically or contact us at the address listed at the end of this Policy. By using the Site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Policy is part of our Terms of Use Agreement. Please <a href="http://www.cpk.com/terms/" title="California Pizza Kitchen - Terms of Use">click here</a> to see that Agreement.
			</p>
		</div>
		<ol class="terms">
			<li>
				<span class="section">Information You Provide Us.</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>a. Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
				<p>In general, you can visit CPK.com without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. If you choose to register or become a member of our loyalty program and are 13 years of age or older, we will collect your name, date of birth, email address, and street address along with other information you may choose to submit, and you will choose a password as part of the registration process ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). If you make a purchase on our Site we will also ask you for additional information including the credit card number and expiration date, billing address, shipping address, name on the account and telephone numbers for the billing and shipping addresses ("Credit Card Information").</p>

				<p>For your security we do not keep or store your Credit Card Information after your purchase transaction is completed unless you elect to create a profile containing your Credit Card Information or utilize our Google wallet function. We only use your Credit Card Information as necessary to complete your purchase transactions.</p>

				<p>We may combine information that we may collect from you from different means online as well as offline (or through mobile applications) into one customer database, and use that information in order to communicate with you and determine special offers to send to you.</p>
				<p>b. Social Networking Information</p>
				<p>
					Our Site may provide the opportunity for you to post information about you and/or your experiences with us. Remember, by posting any information, it will become publicly available, so please use discretion regarding posting your own personal information. We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalize your experience on the Site. This information may include PII such as your username or id and email address, as well as interests, activities, and relationships to other users of the Site or of social media.
				</p>
				<p>
					c. Contact information for email newsletters, emails and/or mobile offers
				</p> 
				<p>From time to time we send newsletters, emails and/or other communications to share information  or special offers about the Site, our restaurants or loyalty program. If  you have registered with our Site, loyalty program, a mobile application or another of our promotions you are likely to receive such communications. If you provide us with your mobile number or obtain a mobile application we may send communications to your phone or via the mobile application. </p> 

				<p>Remember, if you elect to receive texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your wireless carrier for details.</p>

				<p>You may opt out of receiving communications from us by following the instructions provided on the Site or by following the instructions or links contained in the communication. </p>
				<p>d. Entry information for Contests or Sweepstakes</p>

				<p>We may operate contests, sweepstakes or other promotions through our Site or social media outlets which may require registration in order to enter. The PII that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, your first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age and email address. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists.</p>

				<p>Winners of contests, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will often be required to provide additional PII in order to authenticate themselves or to fulfill the prize. Entry into a contest or sweepstakes or acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Your PII may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes.</p>

				<p>If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature’s terms of use. We urge you to review the official rules and privacy policy (if different) of the particular contest/sweepstakes  before participating. In the event that the Official Rules of a contest/sweepstakes conflict with this Privacy Policy, the Official Rules will govern.</p>

				<p>e. Information collected for Surveys or Voting</p>

				<p>From time-to-time we may request PII from you via surveys or voting polls. Most surveys will be anonymous and not request your PII. However, at times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.  All survey participation is, of course, voluntary, and you will be able to decide the information you provide.</p>

				<p>f. Information collected for “Send to a Friend” messages.</p>

				<p>The Site may allow you to send information on the site via email, social network, or other messaging system to recipients who you feel may be interested in receiving such information. To use this feature you provide us with certain information about the receiving party. Any PII you provide in connection with sending such other party the message, such as your name and your email address will, of course, be disclosed to such other party. While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's information may be retained in our systems as required for delivery and logging, we do not knowingly share it with third parties and we do not use this PII for any purpose except to send this one-time message (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of his/her PII). Recipients of these messages will not be opted in to any future communications from us unless they have previously given their consent to us through other means.</p>

				<span class="section">Cookies.</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>We use cookies to personalize our Site for you and to collect aggregate information about Site usage by all of our users.

				<span class="section">IP Addresses and Click-stream Data.</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors and/or other internal uses related to the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address.

Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="section">Use of Information.</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>We may use aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for our own research and commercial purposes. This information includes what areas/features our users visit most frequently. We use this information to improve the Site.</p>  

				<p>We use your PII in order to send communications and information to you regarding the Site, our restaurants and special offers. We also send you information about third-party products and services that we think you may find of interest, but we do not provide your PII to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

				<p>We reveal Personally Identifiable Information about you to unaffiliated third parties if: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) the information is provided as we may in our sole discretion determine is necessary or reasonably required to comply with the law, applicable regulations, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.); (4) the disclosure is done as part of an actual or contemplated purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets); (5) the information is provided to our agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, processing orders, etc.); or (6) to others as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="section">Choice and Access.</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>If you do not wish to receive offers or other notices from us in the future, you can "opt out" by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this policy or by following the procedures stated in any communication.</p>

				<p>To review your PII, make any changes or corrections or to request that we remove your information please contact us at the address listed below. We will try to complete your request as promptly as possible. Any changes will affect only future uses of your PII.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="section">Security</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>We store and process PII on servers and computers we control in the U.S. We use reasonable technical and administrative security measures designed to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>   

				<p>While we have implemented reasonable security measures please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and no transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any member name and password you use in connection with the Site or our mobile applications. If you believe that your account information is being used in an unauthorized fashion, you must contact us immediately.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="section">Protecting Children's Privacy.</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information  from anyone under 13 years of age (“Minors”) except as permitted by law. We are committed to protecting Minors' privacy online and meeting the requirements of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. While we offer programs, such as the CPKids Birthday Club, which are intended to appeal to Minors, only a parent or guardian may register a Minor in the program.</p>

				<p>We do not publish names, ages, or images of contest winners under 13 without first receiving parental or guardian consent.</p>

				<p>If you have knowledge that a child under the age of 13 has submitted Personally Identifiable Information to us inappropriately or if parents or guardians want to review, change or delete their child's registration information, simply contact us via email, by clicking on the link on the registration page or by writing us at the address below. Parents can also telephone us at 310-342-5000.  Parents will be required to provide verification in order to access or change information.</p>

				<p>If we are aware that a Minor who is not registered on our Site contacts CPK through an email, we will respond to that email on a one-time basis without obtaining parental consent and we will delete the email address. We will not use that email address to contact the Minor thereafter.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="section">Mobile Applications</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>Our customer mobile applications (each an “App”) are made available to you for use in connection with such activities as participating in our loyalty program, finding our locations and placing orders with us.  We collect and use non-personally identifiable (e.g. geo-location) and personally identifiable (e.g. name, phone number and e-mails) through each App solely for the purpose of providing you with the information you request in using the App as well as providing notifications and other information relevant to the App and/or special offers from us.</p>

				<p>Other than precise geo-location data,  passwords and Credit Card Information (when that functionality is available), we do not collect any sensitive information.</p>

				<p>Information we collect is used for the purpose of the App and communicating with you. Information is not disclosed to third parties for marketing purposes, but may be disclosed to service providers who assist us in completing transactions and helping us communicate with you.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="section">Limitation of Liability</span>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					By providing us with any personally-identifiable information you expressly and unconditionally release and hold us harmless from any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your PII. In addition, while we take efforts to ensure the proper and appropriate use of data by our service providers and third parties that may receive your information from us, we cannot be liable for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your PII caused by those service providers and third parties.
