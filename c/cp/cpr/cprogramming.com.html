Privacy policy:

Cprogramming.com collects information in a few ways.  First, our email list asks, but does not require, you to input personal information, except for an email address which is required.  Our message board allows you to register, but once again, this is not required.  Third, our guestbook asks for information which is, once again, not required.  For the information, we only use the general demographic information, such as age, to target our sponsors advertising.  On the guestbook, it is publicly available, although it is possible to make it a private message, in which case only we can read it.  The message board allows other to read your profile, and keeps a listing of different relevant factors about individuals in separate files, which we don't use for anything, actually.  Clearly, the message board allows people to post information which is available to everyone.  Ah, the message board keeps ip addresses, which are only available to moderators and administrators and which are used in case it becomes necessary to block certain members from using the message board.  We have disabled all non-flycast statistics (other than the above) utilities which could collect demographics data and ip-addresses (except the above message board).<br>

Aside from that, in working with flycast:<br>
