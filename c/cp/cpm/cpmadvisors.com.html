                    <p>The following describes the overall company practices of CPM Advisors, Inc. including all subsidiaries, affiliates and network (referred to as "CPM Advisors", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy was created to let you know what information we collect when you visit our web sites and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites, why we collect it and how it is used.
                    </p><h4>What Information Is Collected?</h4>
                    <h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data</h4>
                    <p>CPM Advisors may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a CPM Advisors Web site or the Web site of one of CPM Advisors' business customers, including advertisers and Web publishers (collectively "Business Customers"). This anonymous data includes information such as a web visitor's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a web visitor, date and time, domain type, and responses by a web visitor to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor. We, and/or a third party advertising technology vendor, may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and pixels. In addition, as a part of the registration process, users may provide us with additional non-personally identifiable information. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be provided with the users consent would include age, gender, and interests. None of the foregoing information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable data"), by itself, or together, can by its nature be tracked to a specific individual's personally identifiable information. Web visitors may elect not to allow us to use anonymous data by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth below.
                    </p><h4>Personally Identifiable Consumer Data (PII)</h4>
                    <p>To date, on our wholly owned properties we do not ask for personally identifiable information other than outlined below for business purposes. At some of CPM Advisors' partner properties, people may be asked to register and provide personally identifiable data. CPM Advisors is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.
                    </p><h4>Other Information that is Collected</h4>
                    <p>At some CPM Advisors properties, including this one, CPM Advisors collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with CPM Advisors ("business information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of CPM Advisors' web advertising network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information and sending payments. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.
                    </p><h4>How Is Such Information Used?</h4>

We may also share non-personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and third party partners for similar use.
                    </p><p>If a consumer elects to provide CPM Advisors with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to better serve consumers with offers that may be of interest to them. For example, you may register for a newsletter and provide us with your email, If a consumer elects to provide us with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described herein or may have such data deleted in its entirety at any time. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt Out process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the service in question.
                    </p><p>We collect PII from customers who are individuals or companies that wish to enter into business relationships with CPM Advisors, including websites and online marketers.
