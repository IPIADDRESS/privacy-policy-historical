<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We at Collective Media view the protection of individual privacy as critically important. Collective Media's combination of proprietary and partner technology allows us to deliver relevant, targeted content to individuals, but not at the expense of individual privacy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the web sites of Collective Media (including all our subsidiaries, affiliates, and networks) and when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites, why we collect this information, and how we may use and share this information. For more details on our practices, <a href="mailto:contactus@collective.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">contact us</a>.<br><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong><br>Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br></strong></span>Collective Media may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a Collective Media web site or when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites. This anonymous data includes, but not limited to, information such as your IP address, web pages which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and your responses to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor.&nbsp; This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and pixels.&nbsp; This information is not tracked to a specific individual's personally-identifiable information.&nbsp; You may elect not to allow us to use non-personally identifiable information by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth below.<br><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong><br>Personally-Identifiable Information<br></strong></span>Personally-identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number.&nbsp; We do not ask for personally-identifiable information other than as outlined below for business purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some of the Collective Media partner properties, they may ask people to register and provide personally identifiable information. None of this personally identifiable information will be combined with non-PII used for our anonymous ad serving. Collective Media is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.<br><strong><span style="font-size: larger;"><br>Other Information that is Collected</span></strong><br>At some Collective Media properties, including this one, we collect personally-identifiable information from you if you want to become a part of our network of web sites ("business information").&nbsp; We use this information to administer the network, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc.&nbsp; We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.&nbsp;<br><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong>How We Use Your Information<br></strong></span>Collective Media may use your non-personally identifiable information to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a more relevant experience for each person. The non-personally identifiable information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals, and to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients.&nbsp; This information may also be combined with information from other sources, and shared with our affiliates and partners for similar use.</p>
<p>We may retain such information for up to two years.&nbsp; Aggregate reports generated from such information may be kept longer.<br><span style="font-size: larger;"><strong><br>Opt-Out</strong></span><br>Collective Media is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative, a coalition of online advertising networks that provides an opportunity for consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising by member companies.
