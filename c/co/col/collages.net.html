Although this may interfere with and limit our ability to provide you with the services Collages.net offers, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

However, the use of this information by any Successor would still be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, including any amendment after such transaction, and you will continue to have the right to opt-out of sharing your information with third parties.</p>
<p>We may disclose any information you provide to us (i) when we believe disclosure to be appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, or governmental or law enforcement request, or to comply with judicial process; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate this Web Site or to process any orders or registrations or to conduct any promotions, contests, or sweepstakes you participate in; (iii) to protect the rights or property of the Company, its Affiliates,, users, customers, recipients, Members, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, or Merchants (as such terms are defined in the Terms of Use).</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<h2>Your Security</h2>
<p>If you place an order our Web site encrypts your credit card number you submit prior to transmission over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology works best when the site is viewed using Microsoft’s Internet Explorer® or Netscape Navigator®. However, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, we cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to have us provide personal information about you to third parties (other than our Affiliates, subcontractors, or agents acting on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy), please let us know by either:</p>

The use of information you have provided to these third party merchants is governed by their privacy polices and terms. Also, your instructions do not apply to “transactional or relationship” email messages which include, but are not limited to, registration, order status, confirmation or reply emails. (These email messages may also contain promotional items and offers however, that is not their primary purpose.)</p>
<p>Your instructions will only apply to the Collages.net® Web Site, not to our Affiliates and their web sites. Please refer to the policies and opt-out provisions of those other web sites.</p>
<p>Your instructions to limit the use of your information will be processed as soon as reasonably practicable and in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<h2>Your Consent and Changes to this Policy</h2>
