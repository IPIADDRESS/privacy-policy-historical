<h2><strong>PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></h2>
<p>This is the official privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) for this Internet Website (the "Site"), offered in cooperation with <u><a href="http://www.mtvu.com/">mtvU</a></u>, a business of MTV Networks On Campus Inc. and the mtvU Television Channel (together, “mtvU”, “Company”, “we”, “us,” or “ours”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Viacom International Inc. (Viacom International Inc., together with other subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities of Viacom International Inc., including, without limitation, MTV Networks, a division of Viacom International Inc., are referred to as "Affiliates").</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected;</li>
    <li>How we use your Personal Information;</li>
    <li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties;</li>
    <li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
    <li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Site is offered and made available only to users 16  years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its  territories and possessions (“<u>U.S.</u>”) and certain  features on this Site (including, but not limited to, user registration and  newsletter signups) may be subject to heightened age and/or other eligibility  requirements. <strong>If you are not  yet 16 years old or the required greater age for certain features, or do not reside in the U.S., and/or do not  meet any other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site  immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not  participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide  your Personal Information. </strong>This Privacy Policy is a part of  the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <b><u><a href="terms-of-use">Terms of Use  Agreement</a></u></b>. Any terms that are not  defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use  Agreement. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use  Agreement are legally binding on all users.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site’s homepage. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates. We may also e-mail you, at our discretion, about these changes.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting users' privacy.

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
<h3>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
<p>This Site qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <u><a href="mailto:suggestions@collegepublisher.com">suggestions@collegepublisher.com</a></u>, or you may contact us via regular mail at:</p>

We have no access to or control over these cookies. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information. <b>This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party Advertiser or ad server may collect from you.</b> We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. Use of Advertisers’ tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about these third party servers please <u><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a></u>.</p>
<p>Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update the Site and enhance the experience for all users, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. We use tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate the Site, enhance and improve our services, improve the look of the Site and display advertising and marketing information. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through your browser. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features of the Site that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable – like the features mentioned above – and some of our other services will not function properly.</p>
<p><b>5. Privacy of Your Postings:</b> We respect the privacy of the contents of any Personal Information related to or contained in a Posting, unless the information is intended to be disclosed (such Personal Information, except as intended to be disclosed, is called “Confidential Personal Information”). However, we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Site or Confidential Personal Information to a third party, if we believe such action is required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce this Privacy Policy or the terms of the <u><a href="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a></u> Agreement, or to protect the interests of our users, Advertisers, Parent Companies, Affiliates, suppliers, operational service providers, and others. Please see the Terms of Use Agreement for details regarding Postings.</p>
<p><b>6. Disclosure to Third Parties:</b> We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our Advertisers or that are not colleges and universities participating in or in connection with the Site (the “Colleges”), except in the limited circumstances listed below. As stated above, we will disclose Personal Information related to or contained in a Posting in connection with the display of and other services relating to such Posting as such Personal Information is intended to be disclosed. When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to Advertisers, we ask for you to opt in to do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the Advertisers’ own privacy policies. <b>For opt-out procedures, please see the section of this Privacy Policy above entitled “Use of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions and Offers; Opt-Out Procedures”.</b></p>
<p><b>a. Co-Branded Services and Features.</b> The Site may also offer co-branded services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another company or our Affiliates ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services and features may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner’s website. We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect and use your Personal Information provided during the registration process and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service. Registered or other users that participate in certain services relating to Postings, such as user video uploads, agree to have certain Personal Information posted on the Site or Platforms (as defined in the <u>User Content Submission Agreement</u> that relates to user video uploads) or, if such feature is offered in connection with a Co-Branded Partner, on our Co-Branded partner’s website in connection with the display of the uploaded video and posted on any platform that the uploaded video may be posted. Registered or other users that upload videos may also be required to submit additional Personal Information.</p>
<p><b>b. Operational Service Providers.</b> We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site’s services, features, functions and operations. We will refer to these third parties as “operational service providers”. We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with the Site or the mtvU Channel. Additionally, such operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
<p>c. Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We will make your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);</li>
    <li>If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, the <u><a href="terms-of-use">Terms of Use Agreement</a></u>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Site, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of the Site, the mtvU Channel, the Parent Companies, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party;</li>
    <li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or</li>
    <li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>7. Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information:</b> We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.</p>
<p><b>8. Phishing:</b> Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. <b> WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</b> If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <u><a href="mailto:suggestions@collegepublisher.com">suggestions@collegepublisher.com</a></u>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
<p><b>9. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information:</b> Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by this Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as your email address, cannot be deleted and can only be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information; certain Personal Information, such as email address, cannot be deleted but can be modified. Deletion of certain Personal Information, such as username, may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made. To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information collected by the Site, please send an e-mail to suggestions@collegepublisher.com or written mail to College Publisher; 100 City Hall Plaza, Level 2; Boston, MA 02108, including your name, email address and the information to be changed.</p>
<p>If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions such as contests and sweepstakes, you will need to contact the Site’s Privacy Administrator via email with a request at <u><a href="mailto:suggestions@collegepublisher.com">suggestions@collegepublisher.com</a></u> and be prepared to provide verification of your identity. Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.</p>
<p>Children under the age of 13 that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the <u><a href="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a></u> Agreement. Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child’s membership must use their child’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and select “EDIT ACCOUNT” or alternatively, you can send us an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID (please see above for how to change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If a parent does not have his or her child’s User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child. Company will send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s account and registration. The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Company will then terminate the child’s account but will notify the child of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.</p>
<p><b>10. Questions:</b> If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your Personal Information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to <u><a href="mailto:suggestions@collegepublisher.com">suggestions@collegepublisher.com</a></u>.</p>
<p><b>11. Sole Statement:</b> This document is the sole statement of the Site’s Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, is valid.</p>
