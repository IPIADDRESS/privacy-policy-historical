        <p><b>Disclosure Regarding Collection and Use of Personal Information</b></p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting COLLEGEXPRESS.COM, a website of 360 Youth, LLC. This notice explains
        our online information collection and use practices and the choices you can make about the
        way we use and share such information.  Please take the time to read and understand this
        policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information.  OUR ONLINE INFORMATION
        COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PRACTICES REGARDING INFORMATION OBTAINED OFFLINE.</p>

        <p>REMEMBER IF YOU REGISTER WITH COLLEGEXPRESS.COM, PARTICIPATE IN A SURVEY, PURCHASE
        SOMETHING FROM US, REQUEST A CATALOG OR OTHER INFORMATION, ENTER ANY OF OUR CONTESTS,
        SWEEPSTAKES OR PROMOTIONS, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. AS WE UPDATE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICES,
        THIS POLICY MIGHT CHANGE, SO CHECK IT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME.</p>

        <p><b>The Information We Collect.</b><br>
        At COLLEGEXPRESS.COM you can do a variety of things!  You may be able to request information,
        order products, enter contests, participate in surveys, vote in polls, subscribe to a service
        or participate in a chat room. The types of personally identifiable information (i.e.
        information that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted) that
        may be collected at these pages could include: name, address, age, date of birth, gender,
        grade level, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and
        information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services.
        You can view or change your information at any time. Click
        <a href="/registration/profile/reedit.do;jsessionid=C087E0BC0F1057150179965C43A8D23C?siteId=1">here</a>
        to edit your profile or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a
        person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift
        online and want it sent directly to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and address.
        The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at
        these pages may include: recipient's name, address, age, date of birth, grade level, e-mail
        address, gender and telephone number.</p>

        <p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e. generic
        information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web pages such
        as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of
        operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your
        Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink).</p>

        <p><b>How We Use Your Personal Information.</b><br>
        We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) you have
        submitted.  Examples of us using your personal information for the purpose(s) submitted
        include if you request information online, we will send to such information or if you have
        won a contest, sending to you an email notification that you have won.  In addition, we may
        send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested
        in or to ask you to participate in a survey.  For example, we may send to you an e-mail
        regarding special offers and announcements about products or services offered by us. We
        may also contact you offline.  For example, when you provide your mailing address, we may
        send to you in the mail special offers, promotions and announcements, which we think may be
        of interest to you. If you want us to stop using the personal information you provided in
        these ways, please go to

        at COLLEGEXPRESS.COM or contact us at <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.</p>

        <p><b>How We Share Your Personal Information.</b><br>
        We will not share the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s)
        you provided it;  (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think
        necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or
        subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is
        causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another);
        (d) with other persons or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations
        or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or  a promotional item that
        you have requested on the site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make changes to one of our
        subscriber agreements or this policy.</p>

        <p>Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you
        request information regarding financial aid, we may provide the information provided to a
        third party lender so that they can send to you directly the information you requested or
        if you enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, we may forward your
        information to such third party.</p>

        <p>We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either
        by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail).</p>

        <p>We do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties"
        for purposes of this policy.  Thus, we may also share personal information provided online
        with companies owned directly or indirectly by Alloy, Inc. Any of these companies may use
        and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal
        information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a manner
        that is consistent with this policy. If you want us to stop sharing your personal information
        among Alloy owned companies, please go to
        <a href="/registration/profile/reedit.do;jsessionid=C087E0BC0F1057150179965C43A8D23C?siteId=1">Edit My Profile</a>
        at COLLEGEXPRESS.COM or contact us at <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you provide online
        with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party companies) who want to market
        products or services to you or to ask you questions, both online and offline. If you want
        us to stop sharing your personal information with these companies, please go to
        <a href="/registration/profile/reedit.do;jsessionid=C087E0BC0F1057150179965C43A8D23C?siteId=1">Edit My Profile</a>
        at COLLEGEXPRESS.COM or contact us at <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.
        If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to
        communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their
        communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online.  In this instance,
        any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each
        company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not
        be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.</p>

        <p>If we do share personal information to a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical,
        we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy.
        We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal
        information.</p>

        <p><b>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.</b><br>
        We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the
        design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.
        We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how our site is used, as well
        as to offer you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information
        with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.</p>

        <p><b>Collection of Information by Others.</b><br>
        Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different
        than ours. You should check the other sites' privacy notices since we have no control
        over information that is submitted to or collected by them.</p>

        <p>We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored
        by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these
        third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that site visitors voluntarily
        submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over
        the use of this information by these companies.</p>

        <p><b>Cookies.</b><br>
        To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies
        are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences.
        Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable
        information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose
        to provide the personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the
        data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
        your computer.</p>

        <p>We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our site
        is used, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use
        cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information
        on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also
        may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services. You can opt to have your browser
        reject cookies. If you do that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit
        our site in order to participate in certain promotions and other stuff. You should also
        know that companies that advertise on our web site (and their agents) might use their own
        cookies. This policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies.</p>

        <p><b>Clickstream Data.</b><br>
        As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you
        visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be
        collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of
        computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which
        you linked to COLLEGEXPRESS.COM. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally
        identifiable information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each
        page of COLLEGEXPRESS.COM, how visitors navigate throughout the site and how we may
        tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be
        used to improve our site. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and
        aggregate.</p>

        <p><b>Supplementing Information.</b><br>
        From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources,
        such as information validating your address.  Thus, information we obtain through
        COLLEGEXPRESS.COM may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information
        obtained through sources other than COLLEGEXPRESS.COM, including both offline and online sources.</p>

        <p><b>Discussions and Community Tools.</b><br>
        We may, from time to time, make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and other
        community tools available to you.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in
        these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use.  For
        example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen
        name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by
        using COLLEGEXPRESS.COM and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and
        other community tools, you agree that we may do so.  You should exercise caution when deciding
