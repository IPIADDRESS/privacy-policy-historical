  <strong>Disclosure Regarding Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for visiting CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM, a website of 360 Youth, LLC. 
  This notice explains our online information collection and use practices 
  and the choices you can make about the way we use and share such information. 
  Please take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can 
  understand how we use your personal information. OUR ONLINE INFORMATION 
  COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PRACTICES REGARDING 
  INFORMATION OBTAINED OFFLINE.
</p>

<p>
  REMEMBER IF YOU REGISTER WITH CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM, PARTICIPATE IN A 
  SURVEY, PURCHASE SOMETHING FROM US, REQUEST A CATALOG OR OTHER INFORMATION, 
  ENTER ANY OF OUR CONTESTS, SWEEPSTAKES OR PROMOTIONS, YOU AGREE TO THESE 
  TERMS. AS WE UPDATE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICES, THIS POLICY MIGHT CHANGE, 
  SO CHECK IT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The Information We Collect.</strong><br>
  At CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM you can do a variety of things! You may be able 
  to request information, order products, enter contests, participate in 
  surveys, vote in polls, subscribe to a service or participate in a chat 
  room. The types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information 
  that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted) 
  that may be collected at these pages could include: name, address, age, 
  date of birth, gender, grade level, e-mail address, telephone number, 
  fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in 
  and use of various products, programs and services. You can view or change 
  your information at any time. Click here to edit your profile or send an 
  e-mail to <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you 
  might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic 
  greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly 
  to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and address. The types 
  of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other 
  people at these pages may include: recipient's name, address, age, date 
  of birth, grade level, e-mail address, gender and telephone number.
</p>

<p>
  We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information 
  (i.e. generic information that does not identify you personally) when you 
  visit any of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., 
  Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, 
  (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service 
  provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How We Use Your Personal Information.
  We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) 
  you have submitted. Examples of us using your personal information for the 
  purpose(s) submitted include if you request information online, we will 
  send to such information or if you have won a contest, sending to you an 
  e-mail notification that you have won. In addition, we may send to you an 
  e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested 
  in or to ask you to participate in a survey. For example, we may send to 
  you an e-mail regarding special offers and announcements about products 
  or services offered by us. We may also contact you offline. For example, 
  when you provide your mailing address, we may send to you in the mail 
  special offers, promotions and announcements, which we think may be of 
  interest to you. If you want us to stop using the personal information 
  you provided in these ways, please go to Modify Email Preferences at 
  CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM or contact us at 
  <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.
</strong></p><strong>

<p>
  <strong>How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong><br>
  We will not share the personal information you provide except (a) if it 
  is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be 
  required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others 
  from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to 
  a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing 
  (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property 
  of another); (d) with other persons or companies with whom we contract to 
  carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, 
  sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the 
  site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make changes to one of our 
  subscriber agreements or this policy.
</p>

<p>
  Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted 
  are if you request information regarding financial aid, we may provide the 
  information provided to a third party lender so that they can send to you 
  directly the information you requested or if you enter a contest or 
  sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, we may forward your information 
  to such third party.
</p>

<p>
  We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is 
  collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such 
  as sending to you an e-mail).
</p>

<p>
  We do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies 
  to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy. Thus, we may also share 
  personal information provided online with companies owned directly or 
  indirectly by Alloy, Inc. Any of these companies may use and further share 
  this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal 
  information to a family company, we require that it protect such information 
  in a manner that is consistent with this policy. If you want us to stop 
  sharing your personal information among Alloy owned companies, please go 
  to Modify Email Preferences at CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM or contact us 
  at <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you 
  provide online with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party 
  companies) who want to market products or services to you or to ask you 
  questions, both online and offline. If you want us to stop sharing your 
  personal information with these companies, please go to Modify Email 
  Preferences at CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM or contact us at 
  <a href="mailto:myinfo@360youth.com">myinfo@360youth.com</a>. If you 
  consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you 
  may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you 
  no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change 
  any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments 
  to your personal information must be given directly to each company who 
  communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will 
  not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.
</p>

<p>
  If we do share personal information to a non-affiliated company, to the 
  extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner 
  that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these 
  non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.</strong><br>
  We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we 
  collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us 
  to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information 
  in the aggregate to analyze how our site is used, as well as to offer you 
  products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information 
  with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Collection of Information by Others.</strong><br>
  Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices 
  may be different than ours. You should check the other sites' privacy 
  notices since we have no control over information that is submitted to 
  or collected by them.
</p>

<p>
  We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that 
  are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our 
  agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable 
  information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the 
  contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of 
  this information by these companies.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cookies.</strong><br>
  To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use 
  "cookies." Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web 
  server to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell 
  us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless 
  you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to 
  provide the personally identifiable information, this information may be 
  linked to the data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run 
  programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
</p>

<p>
  We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand 
  how our site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. 
  For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web 
  pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to 
  recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also may use cookies 
  to offer you products, programs or services. You can opt to have your 
  browser reject cookies. If you do that, you may need to re-register with 
  us every time you visit our site in order to participate in certain 
  promotions and other stuff. You should also know that companies that 
  advertise on our web site (and their agents) might use their own cookies. 
  This policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Clickstream Data.</strong><br>
  As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each 
  web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as 
  "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. 
  Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software 
  you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to 
  CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM. We may use clickstream data as a form of 
  non-personally identifiable information to anonymously determine how 
  much time visitors spend on each page of CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM, how 
  visitors navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web 
  pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only 
  be used to improve our site. Any collection or use of clickstream data 
  will be anonymous and aggregate.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Supplementing Information.</strong><br>
  From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information 
  from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, 
  information we obtain through CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM may be intermingled 
  with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other 
  than CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM, including both offline and online sources.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Discussions and Community Tools.</strong><br>
  We may, from time to time, make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news 
  groups and other community tools available to you. Please remember that 
  any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information 
  for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, 
  we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you 
  post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and 
  by using CAREERSANDCOLLEGES.COM and/or these chat rooms, forums, message 
  boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do 
  so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal 
  information in these areas, since anyone ? not just us ? may use publicly 
  posted information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Our Commitment to Security.</strong><br>
  We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and 
  managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, 
  maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online 
  as well as offline. When your personal information is passed onto 
  non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we require that they 
  also have in place the appropriate safeguards. We cannot, however, 
  guarantee that they do so.
</p>
