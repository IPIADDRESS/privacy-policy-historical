<h3>When We Share Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>College Confidential only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of College Confidential in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we have your consent;</li>
<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce the Terms of Service and/or Forum Rules, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of College Confidential, its users or the public as required or permitted by law; and</li>
<li>College Confidential becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, and information submitted by you, including your personal information, is transferred as a business asset.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may share non-personal information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share such non-personal information with our affiliates and third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine Website usage information we collect with other non-personal information we obtain from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, including business advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.</p>
<h3>Choices for Personal Information</h3>
<p>You can use the Website without providing any personal information, however, certain parts of the Website, such as the forums, require that you register as a user and provide some personal information as part of the registration process. </p>
<p>If we use your personal information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
<h3>Online Tracking</h3>
<p>We may allow third-parties, including advertising companies and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Website. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. These third parties may collect information about whether you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. </p>
<p>This Website does not track your online activities over time and across third-party websites.  Because we do not employ tracking technology, we offer no response to “Do Not Track” requests transmitted by web browsers.</p>
<h3>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. It also requires that we obtain parental consent before we allow children under the age of 13 to register as a member of the College Confidential community. The Website is primarily intended for use by high school and college aged teens and young adults and their parents, and is therefore not intended to be used by children under the age of 13. If you are a user who is under the age of 13, we must have permission from your parent or legal guardian before you can register as member of the Website. </p>
<p>A parent or legal guardian may ask College Confidential to provide them with the information we maintain about their child so that they may request corrections. This information will be sent via postal mail, which we believe is the most secure method of communication. Please contact College Confidential by email at <a href="mailto:admin@collegeconfidential.com">admin@collegeconfidential.com</a> or in writing at:</p>
<p>Attn: Security and Privacy Requests<br>
College Confidential<br>
1626 Placentia Ave.<br>
Costa Mesa, CA 92627</p>

<p>We will need to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child’s parent or legal guardian. </p>
<p>A parent or legal guardian may revoke consent to collect their child's personal information at any time, and they may also request to have their child's personal information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of such information by College Confidential. Please contact us using the process described above if you wish to have your child’s information deleted. However, please understand that, even after removal, your child's content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or by others if a user has copied or stored such content.</p>
<h3>Email Communications</h3>
<p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. For this reason, we try to keep emails to a minimum. We will send you email relating to your personal transactions, and we may send you service-related announcements on the rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. You may also receive certain marketing email communications from time to time, in accordance with your preferences, however, we will give you the ability to opt out of such email communications at any time. 
</p><p>Please understand that if you opt-out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with College Confidential.</p>
<h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
<p>When you are on our Website you may be able to visit or link to other sites not operated by us. We do not control such sites and we are not responsible for the information practices of these sites. This Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other websites, and we encourage you to read the posted privacy policies of such sites.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>We may disclose user information when compelled to do so by government authorities or otherwise as required or permitted by law, such as to respond to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interfering with our rights or property, other customers or users of the Website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as the forums, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public. Therefore, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information to such areas of our Website, including your full name, home address, phone number, financial information or any other information that would enable other users to locate you or contact you.</p>
<p>Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email, SMS messaging or similar communications.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>College Confidential regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or College Confidential's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this Website or by writing to us at College Confidential, 1626 Placentia Ave., Costa Mesa, CA 92627. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is our policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between College Confidential and an individual.</p>
<h3>Updating Personal Information</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Requests to change your user name or edit or delete posts will not be considered.</span> A user’s email address can be updated at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@collegeconfidential.com">Admin@collegeconfidential.com</a> with your user name, email address on file and new email address. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that require extraordinary technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical.</p>
<p>User accounts are personal to the registered user. In the event of the death of a user, the user’s account will be deactivated, however, existing content will not be removed from the forums. College Confidential cannot provide any personal information regarding the user or the account (including user name and password) to any family member, next of kin or legal representative without an order from a court of competent jurisdiction compelling College Confidential to do so.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page, however, College Confidential recommends that Website users review the most up-to-date version of the Terms of Service, Forum Rules and Privacy Policy periodically at <a href="http://www.collegeconfidential.com">www.collegeconfidential.com</a>.</p>
