			<p>This Statement was last updated on September 1, 2014.</p>
			<br>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">PRIVACY &amp; SECURITY</div>This Privacy and Security Statement (“Policy”) describes how CWC Direct LLC (“We,” “Our,” or “Company”) treat personal information on the websites where it is located. This policy does not apply to the websites and practices of Our subsidiaries or other affiliates.<p></p>
			<p>We may revise this Privacy and Security Statement at any time without notice by updating this page. By using this Site you agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this Site and page to determine the current terms to which you are bound. In the event we make a material change to this Statement, you will be notified of such changes and given the opportunity to opt-out of new or different uses of your personal information. When this Privacy and Security Statement is revised, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Statement.</p>
			<br>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">PRIVACY</div><p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">Do you sell or trade customer e-mail addresses?</div>No. We never sell, rent, or trade e-mail addresses.  Because we think that products of our affiliate, The Talbots, Inc. (“Talbots”), would be of interest to you, we may share your information with Talbots.  Talbots will use your information as described in its privacy policy, which can be found <a href="http://www.talbotsinc.com/brands/talbots/Privacy.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.<p></p>
			<p>We do occasionally share names and mailing addresses with other reliable companies. We may provide our trusted third party service providers with customer e-mail addresses, for use solely in connection with providing services to us, as explained in more detail below. If you prefer that we not share your name, e-mail address or mailing address, please email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com">customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com</a>.</p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">Does Coldwater Creek acquire names and addresses?</div>Yes. We may acquire names and addresses, as well as other information as described below, from various sources, including through this website and our pages on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, when you call or e-mail us or communicate with us through social media, when you participate in promotions, contests or surveys, or from third parties.<p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">What kind of information will I be asked to provide?</div>When you place an order, request e-mail updates, request a catalog, or participate in a promotion, contest or survey, we may ask for some or all of the following: your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. If placing an order, we may ask for credit card information.<p></p>
			<p>We maintain a record of your online, catalog and store purchases. If you ship your order to an address different from your billing address, we will ask you to enter the Ship To name and address. If you use Send-a-Hint, you will be asked for the e-mail address of the recipient. If you use Send-a-Hint or send an electronic gift card to someone, you will be asked for the e-mail address of the recipient. We never use these e-mail addresses for any other purpose except as stated in this Policy.</p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">How will Coldwater Creek use the information I provide?</div>Your information is used to process and deliver your order to the address you request. Your payment information allows us to bill your credit card company. If we have any questions regarding your order, we will contact you by phone or e-mail. If you make a purchase, we may send you information and updates about new products, special sales, customer surveys and promotions. We use both e-mail and postal addresses to share information with our customers. When you supply e-mail addresses in Send-a-Hint or to send an electronic gift card, we use those addresses only for the purpose you intend.<p></p>
			<p>We often use testimonials from our customers in printed material or on our website, but only when we have express permission to do so. Testimonials come from customer comments sent or e-mailed directly to us. We may use information we obtain about you to enforce our Terms of Use and to protect against and prevent fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims and other liabilities, and manage risk exposure, including by identifying potential hackers and other unauthorized users.</p>
			<p>We may share customer information with select third parties.</p>
			<p>From time to time we provide aggregate, statistical information about consumers and sales on our website and site shopping information. These statistics are used in communications, such as our annual report, and do not identify individuals.</p>
			<p>We may also share customer information with our trusted third party service providers who provide advertising services using information that our customers provide, such as name, street address, email address, and transaction history, as further described below. Our trusted third parties are contractually prohibited from using customer information for any purpose other than to provide services to Coldwater Creek. If you prefer Coldwater Creek not to share your information with our third party service providers, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com">customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com</a>.</p>
			<p>We may also disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
			<p>We also reserve the right to transfer information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy and Security Statement, except for information that is shared with Talbots, which will be used by Talbots as described in its privacy policy.  Following such a sale, merger or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.</p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">Do I need a password to order from Coldwatercreek.com?</div>No. However, you may find it more convenient if you sign up for an account with us. In your account we can store your name, address and credit card information so you don't have to enter that information during future shopping visits. Only the last four digits of your credit card numbers are displayed for easy identification.<p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">How do I update my personal information?</div>You can update your information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com">customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com</a>.<p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">How does Coldwater Creek respond to Do Not Track Signals?</div>Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to whether you want to allow websites to collect personal information over time about your online activities across different websites or online services. At this time our site does not respond to the preferences you may have set in your web browser regarding the collection of such personal information, and our site may continue to collect personal information in the manner described in this Privacy and Security Statement. We may enable third parties to collect personal information in connection with our site. This Statement does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any collection of personal information by third parties on our site.<p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">How do I discontinue promotional e-mails?</div>At the bottom of each e-mail is information about removing your name from our e-mail list. You may also remove your name or change the frequency of the e-mails you receive in My Account. Log in with your e-mail address and password. Select E-mail &amp; Password Information. On the next screen, make your selection, then save your changes. Our promotions are prepared in advance, so it may take a few days for the change to take effect, and you may receive e-mails during that time.<p></p>
			<p>After you make a purchase, for your convenience we will still send e-mail order confirmations and information about your order. We may also contact you by phone or mail if we have questions regarding your order.</p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">What About Children's Privacy?</div>Coldwater Creek does not direct its websites to children under the age of thirteen. If we learn that a user is under thirteen years of age, we will promptly delete any personal information that such user has provided to us.<p></p>
			<br>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">SECURITY</div><p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">What does Coldwatercreek.com do to protect my information?</div>We use a variety of industry standard technologies and processes to protect your personal and financial information.<p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">What if an unauthorized purchase occurs?</div>We will cover any liability imposed on you by your bank or credit card company, up to $50, in the unlikely event that your card is used without your authorization at Coldwatercreek.com. We will also do whatever we can to help resolve the situation. The Fair Credit Billing Act requires your bank or credit card company to hold you responsible for no more than $50 of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card. Most debit card issuers voluntarily adopt the same liability limitations as credit card issuers, but you may want to check with your bank to make sure. Remember: if unauthorized use of your credit or debit card does occur, it is your responsibility to notify your card provider as stated in your agreement with them.<p></p>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">What about spam?</div>Like hundreds of other companies, Coldwater Creek, Inc. has been the target of a spam e-mail campaign on the Internet; e-mail that is sent illegally and illegitimately to the mass public. The senders create enticing subject lines to make the recipient think the e-mail message is from or has something to do with a legitimate company or organization, when in reality, the sender has nothing to do with the legitimate company. We go to great lengths to ensure our customers' privacy, the integrity of Coldwater Creek, Inc. and our brand. We advise anyone receiving a spam e-mail to report it as abuse to their Internet Service Providers.<p></p>
			<br>
			<p></p><div class="privacyheader">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</div>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Coldwater Creek who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com">customerservice@coldwaterdirect.com</a> or write us:<br><br>Coldwater Creek c/o TG<br>5389 East Provident Dr<br>Cincinnati OH 45246<p></p>
