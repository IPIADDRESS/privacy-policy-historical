      <h5>CollabNet, Inc. New Privacy Policy</h5>
      <p>CollabNet, Inc. ("CollabNet") provides this Website Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process information relating to identifiable individuals ("Personal Information") that we obtain through our public websites at <a href="http://www.collab.net">www.collab.net</a>, <a href="http://www.collab.net">www.collabnet.com</a>, and www.team.collab.net ("Websites"). Personal Information that is not collected on these Websites is not subject to this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Safe Harbor Privacy Principles</strong><br> CollabNet adheres to the European Union Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor Privacy Principles") regarding Personal Information from the European Union that we obtain through the Websites. CollabNet also adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles that apply to agents with respect to Personal Information from the European Union that we obtain through websites that we host as a service to our corporate customers ("Hosted Sites"). In the context of Hosted Sites, we process Personal Information only as a processing agent, on our customers' behalf, and in accordance with our customers' instructions, who ultimately determine how data is processed on Hosted Sites and for what purposes. Thus, the remainder of this Website Privacy Policy does not apply to our data processing activities on Hosted Sites - only the applicable Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and our customers' instructions do. CollabNet's other websites, business units, service offerings, and data collection or processing activities are not covered by CollabNet's self-certification of adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. For further information regarding the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, please see the United States Department of Commerce website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br> In general, you can visit our Websites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. There are some activities, however, where providing Personal Information is required, such as downloading certain white papers or registering for certain services, as discussed below. </p>
      <p> If you wish to download or obtain white papers, newsletters, or certain other articles or materials, you often must register with us. Registration requires the provision of certain Personal Information such as your name, company name, email address and other contact information. The specific categories of Personal Information on the registration form that are required are marked with an asterisk (*). If you do not wish to provide the required information, you may not be able to engage in the particular activity at issue. </p>
      <p>For customers who wish to purchase our Team Edition services offered on www.team.collab.net ("Team Edition Services"), we require that you register and provide us with Personal Information such as your name, company name, address, phone number, email address, along with billing information such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within your organization that will be using such services. </p>
      <p> If you are a user of Team Edition Services - whether because your employer or another organization has purchased the services and invited you to participate in the forum - we will collect your email address in order to provide you with a user name and password. Depending on how your organization wishes to structure the data collections on the forum at www.team.collab.net, you may also be able to post or otherwise provide other Personal Information in the forum in the course of using the Team Edition Services. With respect to such Personal Information, CollabNet acts as a mere processing agent for your organization, and therefore will collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process such Personal Information in accordance with your organization's instructions. </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies and Passive Tracking</strong><br> The Websites use certain "cookies" and other tracking technologies. These technologies allow us to remember your interests as expressed by the pages you visit on our Websites. A cookie is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about your activities on our Websites. The cookie transmits this information back to our Websites' computer that, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Some cookies may serve to recall Personal Information previously registered by you. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You can also set your browser to block or remove cookies; however, if you choose to do so, certain features and functionality of our Websites may no longer be available to you.</p>
      <p> Our Websites also use other tracking technologies to record anonymous information, such as; (i) the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, (ii) the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, (iii) the browser software you use and your operating system, (iv) the date and time you access our Websites, and (v) the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Websites. CollabNet makes full use of data collected through the Websites that is not in individually identifiable form.</p>
      <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br> CollabNet uses the Personal Information collected on the Websites to provide you with requested products, services, articles, and other materials. We also use Personal Information to provide you with ongoing services and support, to customize your experience on our Websites, and to enhance our Websites' content. We also use Personal Information to communicate with you on a variety of topics such as product upgrades, special offers, and events of possible interest to you. To the extent we obtain credit card numbers from you in connection with the Team Edition Services, we use such information solely to confirm your qualification to pay for the Team Edition Services, and to perform and administer the payment transactions. </p>
      <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br> We may disclose Personal Information to service providers that assist us to perform tasks in connection with the Websites, such as to process credit card payment transactions or to contact you on our behalf with information about our products or services. We require such service providers to not use the Personal Information for any purpose other than those for which we provided the Personal Information to them, and require them to apply appropriate security protections for the Personal Information.</p>
      <p> We may disclose Personal Information to technology partners that may wish to offer their own products and services to you, or to resellers that may offer our products and services to you. You will be provided with the opportunity to opt out of having your Personal Information shared with such third parties before it is disclosed. Generally, this option will be available to you on the registration or other page where you provide Personal Information to us. You may also opt out of our sharing of Personal Information with such third parties in the future by sending us an email as described below in the paragraph below on "Opt Out Choice." </p>
      <p> CollabNet may also share Personal Information with government agencies or other third parties where required by or in connection with law enforcement actions, subpoenas or other litigation or applicable law. We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.</p>
      <p><strong>Opt Out Choice</strong><br> You may opt out of receiving newsletters and marketing communications from CollabNet in the future by sending an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@collab.net">unsubscribe@collab.net</a>. You may also opt out of any disclosures of Personal Information by CollabNet to technology partners and resellers in the future by sending us an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@collab.net">unsubscribe@collab.net</a>. These opt out choices do not apply to communications for the purposes of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings or driver updates, or other comparable activities.</p>
      <p><strong>Access and Accuracy</strong><br> To keep your Personal Information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified in the paragraph below on "Questions or Comments." We will make reasonable efforts to update or correct Personal Information that we maintain in our possession on our own behalf. </p>
      <p><strong>Security of Personal Information</strong><br> CollabNet takes appropriate and reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. </p>
      <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br> If we decide to change our Website Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Website Privacy Policy on this Website via a link from the home page. In the event that we change a significant or material term, we will notify you by temporarily revising the link to the Website Privacy Policy to read, for example, "New Website Privacy Policy." </p>
      <p><strong>Questions or Comments</strong><br> If you have any questions or comments regarding our Website Privacy Policy, please contact us at <span class="mailclr">privacy [at] collab.net</span> or send a letter to Mary Ann Moran, Associate General Counsel, Legal Department, CollabNet Inc., 8000 Marina Blvd., Suite 600, Brisbane, CA 94005.</p>
      <p><strong>Effective Date</strong><br> This Website Privacy Policy is effective as of October 1, 2005. </p>
