					<p><span class="H2">Privacy Policy Statement</span></p>
					<p>We at <strong>Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</strong> (referred to as "<strong>Coldwell 
							Banker</strong>," "<strong>We</strong>," "<strong>Us</strong>," or "<strong>Our</strong>") 
						recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information 
						collected about the <strong>users and visitors</strong> of Our Web Site 
						(referred to as "<strong>User</strong>," "<strong>You</strong>" or "<strong>Your</strong>"). 
						This Privacy Policy discloses what information We gather, how We use it, and 
						how to correct or change it. At Coldwell Banker, it is Our intention to give 
						You an understanding about how We collect Your information and the use We make 
						of it in the course of Our business.
					</p>
					<p>To that end, Coldwell Banker gathers two types of information about You: 1) data 
						that Users provide through optional, voluntary registration on Our Web Site, 
						and 2) data that Coldwell Banker gathers through aggregated tracking, mainly by 
						tallying Web pages that are viewed by Users throughout Our Web Site.
					</p>
					<p>However, be assured that Coldwell Banker will not disclose Personal Information 
						(as defined herein) to third parties without Your consent, except as may be 
						noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to You when the information is 
						submitted.</p>
					<span class="H2">How Does Coldwell Banker Collect Information?</span>
					<p><u>Optional Registration</u>:&nbsp; We collect information by specifically 
						requesting it from You. Generally this occurs when You register at the Web Site 
						or request information or a service. Usually, We and Our business partners use 
						Your information to operate the Web Site and to deliver services. Coldwell 
						Banker also uses Your information to inform You about other products and/or 
						services available from Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates.</p>
					<p class="H2">Use of Tracking&nbsp;Use of Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses:</p>
					<p>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to Your computer 
						whenever You are surfing the Internet so that Your computer can be identified 
						by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. This 
						allows Us to identify and gather general information and data about You, such 
						as the Web pages You view.</p>
					<p>Coldwell Banker collects IP addresses for the purposes of: helping Us diagnose 
						problems with Our main computers, for system administration, to report 
						aggregated information to Our business partners, and to audit the use of Our 
						Web Site. When Users request Web pages from Our Web Site, Our Web servers log 
						the User's IP address. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything 
						personally identifiable, which means that a User's session will be logged, but 
						the User will remain anonymous to Us. For example, We collect and/or track the 
						home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of Web browser used 
						by You to access this Web Site. Such collection and tracking information is 
						gathered by Us as You navigate through this Web Site, and shall be used by Us 
						for Our business purposes only.</p>
					<p>We can, and will, use IP addresses to identify You when We feel it is necessary 
						to enforce compliance with Our Web Site Terms of Use or to protect Our service, 
						site, Users, or others.
					</p>
					<p><u>Use Of Cookies</u>: What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information 
						that a Web site sends to Your computer for record-keeping purposes, which 
						information is stored in a file on Your computer's hard drive. Cookies make 
						Web?surfing easier for You by saving Your preferences so that We can use the 
						saved information to facilitate Your use of Our Web Site when You return to the 
						Web Site. Cookies do not tell Us Your individual identity unless You have 
						chosen to provide it to Us. We never save passwords or credit card information 
						in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, You will 
						find that most major Web sites use them.</p>
					<p>By showing how and when Users use the Web Site, cookies help Us see which areas 
						of the Web Site are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to 
						the Web Site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages 
						viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.</p>
					<p>Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or You can delete Your 
						cookie file at any time. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept 
						cookies. You can reset Your Web browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a 
						cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of Coldwell Banker and/or 
						Coldwell Banker-affiliates' services will not function properly or may be 
						considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, You 
						will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty 
						completing marketing transactions.
					</p>
					<p>Coldwell Banker and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates have two (2) primary uses for 
						cookies. First, We use them to specify a User's preferences. Second, We use 
						cookies to track Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps Us understand 
						Our Users' needs better and improve areas of Our Web Site. While both of these 
						activities depend on the use of cookies, You have the option of disabling 
						(refusing) the cookies via Your Web browser preferences.
					</p>
					<p>You may occasionally get cookies from Our business partners. Coldwell Banker 
						and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates do not control these cookies. The use of 
						advertising cookies sent by such third-party Web servers is standard in the 
						Internet industry.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<span class="H2">With Whom Does Coldwell Banker Share Information?</span>
					<p>As a general rule, Coldwell Banker will not disclose any specific personal 
						information that You submit to Us about You ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>") 
						in a manner that connects You with the Personal Information, except when We 
						have Your permission or under special circumstances, such as when We believe in 
						good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. 
						The following describes some of the ways that Your Personal Information may be 
						disclosed.
					</p>
					<p><u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: Coldwell Banker may disclose some or all 
						of Your Personal Information to business partners or sponsors, but this use 
						will be specifically described to You prior to data collection or prior to 
						transferring the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request 
						additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, You give 
						Coldwell Banker permission to transfer Your Personal Information to the sponsor 
						so they can fulfill Your request. In many instances, only Your e-mail address 
						will be shared. If more Personal Information will be shared with the sponsor, 
						You will be notified prior to the transfer.
					</p>
					<p><u>Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data</u>: From time to time, You may be offered 
						the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If 
						You opt to receive information from these third parties, Coldwell Banker will 
						(with Your permission) share Your name and e-mail address with such third 
						parties. Under confidentiality agreements, Coldwell Banker may match Personal 
						Information with third party data. Also, Coldwell Banker may keep track of what 
						portions of the Web Site Users are visiting and other User statistics, and 
						aggregate this information to help Us create a better experience for Users of 
						Our Web Site. This is all done without knowing Your name or other Personal 
						Information in order to describe Our viewers and services to prospective 
						partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
					</p>
					<p><u>Other</u>: Coldwell Banker may also disclose account information in special 
						cases when We have reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
						necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
						violating Our Terms of Use, or may be causing injury to or interference (either 
						intentionally or unintentionally) with any of Coldwell Banker's rights or 
						property, other Users, or anyone else. Coldwell Banker may disclose or access 
						account information when We believe in good faith that the law requires it and 
						for administrative and other purposes that We deem necessary to maintain, 
						service, and improve Our products and services.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<span class="H2">How Can You Control The Usage Of Information?</span>
					<p>In case You change Your mind or some Personal Information changes (such as Your 
						zip code or e-mail address), We will try to provide a way to correct, update or 
						remove the Personal Information that You give us. We also give You the 
						opportunity to control the communications We direct to You. If a User wishes to 
						update Personal Information or objects to any usage provided herein for any 
						reason, he/she may e-mail the requested change to: <strong>[<a id="hypWebmaster" class="Normal" href="mailto:webmaster@cbexchange.com">Coldwell Banker Online Webmaster</a>].</strong></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<span class="H2">What Happens When You Link To A Third Party Site?</span>
					<p>You should be aware that when You are on Coldwell Banker's and/or Coldwell 
						Banker-affiliates' Web site You can hyperlink, or be directed to, other Web 
						sites that are beyond Our control and/or outside Our service. For example, if 
						You "click" on a banner advertisement or a Coldwell Banker search result, the 
						"click" may transfer You off Our Web Site. These other Web sites may include 
						sites of advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Our and/or Coldwell 
						Banker-affiliates' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web 
						sites may send their own cookies to Users, collect data, or solicit 
						Information.
					</p>
					<p>Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates do not control such Web sites, 
						and, therefore, are not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or 
						advertising they choose to place on such Web sites. Coldwell Banker's and/or 
						Coldwell Banker-affiliates' inclusion of hyperlinks to these Web sites do not 
						imply any endorsement of the material on such Web sites or any association with 
						their operators. Our Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is 
						inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond Coldwell Banker's 
						and/or Coldwell Banker-affiliates' control.
					</p>
					<p>Please keep in mind that whenever You give out information on-line (for example, 
						via message boards or forums) that information can be collected and used by 
						people You do not know. While Coldwell Banker and Coldwell Banker-affiliates 
						strive to protect Users' information and privacy, We cannot guarantee the 
						security of any information You disclose on-line, and You disclose such 
						information at Your own risk.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<span class="H2">Is Information Secure From Others Using The Coldwell Banker Web Site?</span>
					<p>The security of all information associated with Our Users is an important 
						concern to Us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of Your 
						information from Your computer to Our servers. Unfortunately, no data 
						transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a 
						result, while We strive to protect Your information, Coldwell Banker and 
						Coldwell Banker-affiliates can't ensure or warrant the security of any 
						information You transmit to Us or from Our on-line products or services, and 
						You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive Your transmission, Coldwell Banker 
						uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of Your
