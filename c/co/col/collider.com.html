<br><br><strong> Overview </strong>
<br><br> This Privacy Policy explains Collider.com, LLC ’s (“<strong>Collider</strong>”) information-gathering and dissemination practices for our website: www.Collider.com (the “<strong>Site</strong>”). This Site provides users with access to entertainment and news about electronic devices along with links to pertinent breaking stories elsewhere on the web. 
 
<br><br> Collider takes your privacy rights seriously and has posted this Privacy Policy to let our users know what information we collect from you, why we collect it and what we do with it. Collider’s goal is to collect and use only that information that we think is necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to better understand you and to provide you with better service. 
 
<br><br><strong>Acceptance of These Terms </strong>
<br><br>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Collider Terms and Conditions for use of the Site. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Site. Your continued use of the Site in light of changes to this Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of the changes for information gathered after the date of the change.
 
<br><br><strong>Does this Privacy Policy apply to you?</strong>
 
<br><br>This privacy policy covers Collider’s information collection and use practices for anyone who uses the Site. 
 
<br><br>This Site, however, contains links to other websites, advertisers and other third parties. By clicking on any of these links, you are leaving the Site. Collider has no control over the information collected from or about you by any third party after you have left the Site. <em>This Privacy Policy does not cover the data collection and use practices of any third party web site linked to </em><em> Collider . </em> Collider assumes no liability and is not responsible for any practices of any third party web sites, including their privacy practices or content. 
 
<br><br>In order to provide users with certain information, the Site provides links to the web sites of certain other organizations and businesses. A link provided on the Site does not constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policies, products, services, or accessibility of that linked web site. Once you link to another web site from the Site, you are subject to the terms and conditions of that web site, including, but not limited to, its Internet privacy policy. <strong></strong>
 
<br><br><strong>What information, including personally identifiable information, does Collider collect from and about you?</strong>
 
<br><br>Our goal in collecting information from and about you is to provide you with the best web experience possible, including providing proper formatting for our web pages and to provide you with information on topics and gadgets of greatest interest to you. 
 
<br><br>In order to provide you with our services, Collider collects two types of information from its community: passive technical information and information you voluntarily provide to Collider, including personally identifiable information.
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Passive Collection of Technical Information. </strong></li>
</ul>
 
Collider automatically collects certain technical information about each visitor, including your IP address, the type of browser you use to surf the Internet, your screen resolution, the URL you visited prior to arriving at the Site, and your computer’s operating system, without you doing anything at all. Your IP address tells us both your Internet Service Provider ( ISP) and the general geographic location from which you are connecting. We may also use your IP address to track the date and time you accessed the Site, how long you stayed on the Site, and what pages you visited. This information is used internally by Collider to help us provide a good web experience, including proper formatting for our web pages. This information is also provided in the aggregate to third parties, including advertisers, to describe basic use patterns for the Site, but this information is not linked to any personally identifiable information before it is disclosed unless Collider has obtained your consent.
 
<br><br>Information, including IP addresses and domain names, is automatically logged to provide technical support for the Collider web site and its associated computer systems, to diagnose system performance or problem areas, and to detect attempts to damage or gain unauthorized access to the web site and its associated computer systems. <strong></strong>

<br><br>To better serve you, we use ‘cookies’ to enhance or customize your visit to this Site. Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser. These files provide a way to distinguish among visitors to this Site. Cookies created on the device you use to access this website do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security. We use the cookie feature to store a randomly generated identifying tag on the device you use to access this Site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet web sites. The software and hardware you use to access the Site allows you to refuse the cookie or delete the cookie file at any time. Refusing or deleting a cookie may, however, limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this Site. <strong></strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information You Provide. </strong></li>
</ul>
 
Collider does not require anyone to register and become a Collider member to use the Site. If you do register to take advantage of Collider’s membership benefits, however, Collider requires that you provide us your first and last name and your ZIP code. Collider will ask you to provide other optional information. Additionally, we ask for your address, gender, and phone number as optional information in registering to become a Collider member so that we can learn more about who our users are and what they want out of our Site. In order to better understand our users and to provide you with a better web experience, Collider may analyze the ages of our users in connection with the pages our users tend to visit and which shows they access. Collider’s use and disclosure of the information you provide us, including personally identifiable information is set forth below. <strong></strong>
 
<br><br>If during your visit to the Site you complete a transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form, the information, including personal information, volunteered by you is used by Collider and/or third-party advertisers. This information is collected by Collider and/or third-party advertisers and may be disclosed by Collider and/or third-party advertisers for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the survey, registration, or order form in which the information was submitted

<br><br><strong>What other organizations besides Collider</strong><strong>may be collecting information from you on the Site?</strong>
 
<br><br> Collider may use outside advertising companies to display banner advertisements on the Site. Banner advertisements may also contain cookies, and appear to be coming from Collider, but, in reality, they are coming from third parties who are serving advertisements on the Site. <strong></strong> Collider has no control over the privacy practices of any third party, and the manner in which any third party uses information it collects from you is not protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
 
<br><br><strong>What happens to my information after Collider collects it? </strong>
 
<br><br>When we collect personally identifiable information from you, we do not share any information with third parties outside of Collider without your consent. You can give this consent by “opting-in” to having your information shared with third parties when you register. These third parties may include our marketing partners, who may want specific information to better shape their marketing efforts. Additionally, we provide the community the opportunity to choose to be sent newsletters and other information. We will not send this information to you unless you “opt in” for these services and publications. 
 
<br><br>In addition, Collider will not sell, dispose, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except as specifically set forth in this paragraph and in the preceding paragraph. When you choose to supply Collider with your personally identifying information, Collider compiles this information in a database with other Collider community members’ information and Collider reserves the right to transfer this information to a successor, related entity or to a third party purchasing or otherwise acquiring Collider’s assets.<strong></strong>
 
<br><br><strong>How can you review and correct information you submitted to the Site, unsubscribe, or opt out?</strong>
 
<br><br>If you choose to provide us with personally identifying information, you may remove your information from our databases by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@dailyimpulse.com">info@Collider.com</a>. In this email, you must include your user name and password, and a description of the information you would like to change.

<br><br><strong>What kinds of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Collider’s control?</strong>
 
<br><br> Collider uses hardware firewalls to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Nonetheless, due to the inherent dangers of the Internet, we cannot guarantee the protection of such information against loss, misuse, or alteration. <strong></strong>

<br><br> Collider is strongly committed to protecting personal information collected through this website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Collider limits employee access to personal information collected through this website to those employees who need access to the information to perform their official duties. Employees with access to personal information are made aware of the need to follow appropriate procedures in connection with any disclosure of that information. <strong></strong>

 
<br><br><strong>Use of the Site by children under the age of 13. </strong>
 
<br><br>The Site is a general audience web site and is intended to be used by adults and teenagers interested in Collider. It is not intended for children, and Collider does not want to collect any personal identifiable information for users who are under the age of 13. The safety of children is very important to Collider, and Collider recommends that parents review this Privacy Policy and understand its terms, so that this Site is used only by persons age 13 and over. <strong></strong>

<br><br><strong>Modifications to this Privacy Policy. </strong>
 
<br><br> Collider reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time to comply with any applicable state or federal regulations, to utilize new technologies, or to improve your Collider experience, so please check back periodically to review our Privacy Policy. If Collider changes any portion of this Privacy Policy, the change will be posted in this document so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it. Collider will not change the use and dissemination practices related to information obtained under a prior version of this Privacy Policy without your prior consent. Please be sure to check this page periodically for changes. This Privacy Policy was last changed and posted on our Site on <strong>July 11 th</strong>2005. <strong></strong>

<br><br><strong>Disclaimer.</strong>
 
<br><br>The information provided in this Privacy Policy should not be construed as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided through the Site.
