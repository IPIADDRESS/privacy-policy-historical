<p>This section sets out how long we retain your information. We have set out specific retention periods where possible. Where that has not been possible, we have set out the criteria we use to determine the retention period.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for determining retention periods</strong></p>
<p>In any other circumstances, we will retain your information for no longer than necessary, taking into account the following:</p>
