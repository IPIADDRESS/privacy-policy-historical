								that College Info USA, Inc. collects and receives. Personal information is information
								you provide about yourself that is personally identifiable, like your name, address,
								email address, or phone number and that is not otherwise publicly available. This

								that College Info USA, Inc. links to, does not own or control, or to people that
								College Info USA, Inc. does not employ or manage.<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
								In order to ensure that consumers get the very best service, College Info USA, Inc.
								collects demographic information, web pages visited and other consumer-volunteered
								information from sources such as forms, and/or site registrations. College Info
								USA, Inc.' s request forms may require users to give us information such as your
								name, address, phone number, social security number, e-mail address and certain
								financial and credit-related information. This information gathering procedure allows
								College Info USA, Inc. to match you with a dealer or partner that we feel is best
								able to fulfill your request. This information also helps College Info USA, Inc.
								in the development or referral of products and services that we believe will meet
								the continuing needs of our customers. Collected information is used to improve
								the content of our website, customize the content and/or layout of our website for
								individual users, and to contact users for marketing purposes as well as route requests
								to our auto dealer network, fulfillment and marketing partners. . Should you request
								an auto loan quote such information will be distributed to our partners for credit
								checks and loan approval.<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Children's Guidelines</strong><br>
								Although this site is intended for the use of adults, and is not of likely interest
								to children, the forms on this site are capable of collecting online contact information
								from children who furnish it without prior parental consent or parental notification.
								Upon discovery that any such information may be supplied by children, such information
								shall be disregarded and deleted.<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Personalization</strong><br>
