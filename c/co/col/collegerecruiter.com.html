<h3>5. PUBLIC FORUMS  </h3>

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on the Services and other sites in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

<li><b>Tracking Across Third-Party Websites</b>. Some third-party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.

The Services does not respond to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals on your browser. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</li>
<li><b>Push Notifications</b>. We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
