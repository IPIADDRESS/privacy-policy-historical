   <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Services and other websites or online services.</p> 
   <p>Such advertisements are served based on your access to and use of our Services and other websites or online services on any of your devices, as well as on data received from third parties. Third-party advertising companies make this possible by placing or recognizing a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). They also use these technologies, along with data they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop. If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">http://optout.aboutads.info/#/</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/</a>.</p> 
   <p><strong>MINORS</strong></p> 
   <p>Unless otherwise indicated, the Services are not directed to minors as defined by applicable law. For example, in the US, minors are individuals under the age of 13, and in the EEA, we honor Member State laws, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from minors. If you provide us with Personal Data of minors, you represent that you have the appropriate authority to do so and that you can demonstrate such authority to us upon request.</p> 
   <p><strong>JURISDICTION AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER</strong></p> 
   <p>Your Personal Data may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and, by using the Services, you understand that your Personal Data will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, to business which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data.</p> 
   <p>Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>. For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, to protect your Personal Data. You may obtain a copy of these measures by clicking <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a><u>.</u></p> 
   <p><strong>SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA</strong></p> 
   <p>Unless we specifically request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Data (e.g., social security numbers, data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us.</p> 
   <p><strong>THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE</strong></p> 
   <p>We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the Services. If you wish to make a payment through the Services, your Personal Data will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third partyâs privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third partyâs collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data.</p> 
   <p><strong>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p> 
   <p>The â<em>LAST UPDATED</em>â legend at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services. Your use of the Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

   <p><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY, AND NOTE TO PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS</strong></p> 
   <p>We care about the privacy of children. We recognize that children's use of the Internet and E-mail raise special concerns regarding privacy and security of information.</p> 
   <p>It is our intention to adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and its rules on collecting personal information from minors. We remind and encourage all parents to check and monitor their children's online activities. Help us protect the privacy of your children by ensuring that they never send E-mail or submit personal information on this site or any other without your permission.</p> 
   <p>We do not condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. We do not share your children's personal information with third parties.</p> 
   <p>Parents have the right to review and have deleted any personally identifiable information we have collected from their children, and refuse to permit further collection of that information. To start this process, please send an email to&nbsp;<a href="/en-us/contact-us">Consumer Affairs</a>.</p> 
   <p>Your children can enjoy most of the content and activities in our children's areas without supplying any personal information to us at all. For example, the Kids World site at&nbsp;<a href="http://kids-world.colgatepalmolive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">kids-world.colgatepalmolive.com</a>&nbsp;offers interesting facts, 
    <g class="gr_ gr_239 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="239" data-gr-id="239">
      games 
    </g> and stories aimed at raising children's awareness of oral health. In addition,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.colgatebsbf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">www.colgatebsbf.com</a>&nbsp;provides oral educational materials designed for teachers,

      parents 
    </g> and kids, and has fun activities for kids. Only a few features collect your child's E-mail address, and then only for the purpose of responding to your child's request or answering your child's question. Once we have responded, we delete your child's E-mail address from our system. For example, our Tooth Fairy asks for your child's E-mail address to send children a special message when they've lost a tooth. This information is used only to respond to the child's request, and no further information is required. The information is captured and stored for twenty-four hours only. Once the Tooth Fairy responds to the child, the information is discarded and cannot be retrieved.</p> 
   <p>We sometimes solicit or accept submissions from children, some of which may be posted on our sites. Such submissions may only be made offline. If a child or parent wants us to post a photograph or any other personally identifiable information, we require a signed parental permission and release form. When children make submissions to us offline, such as by regular mail, we may choose to retain all of the information they submit to us. Unless we received a signed parental permission form, we screen all offline submissions before they are posted, and strip out any personal information they may contain.</p> 
   <p>As more fully described above, we use "cookie" technology, where our servers deposit special codes on a visitor's computer. This information is used to enhance your

    </g> visits. Under no circumstances do we use this information to personally identify visitors or cross-reference the information with any type of personal information that is voluntarily offered on or through the site.</p> 
   <p>For your children's enjoyment, we also link to other sites. We are not responsible for those other sites, and we advise you to check their privacy policies as well.</p>
