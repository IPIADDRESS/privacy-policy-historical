      <b class="gentitle">Privacy Statement
      </b> 
      <p><strong>Commitment to Protection of Individual Privacy</strong></p>
<p>The
  University of Colorado at Boulder (CU-Boulder) supports
  the protection of the privacy of individuals who
  visit official campus websites. It recognizes the
  numerous laws that govern the collection, storage,
    transfer, use and access to personally identifiable
    information. This statement extends to the collection
    of all personally identifiable information, regardless
    of source or medium. However, because CU-Boulder
    is a state institution, some information collected
    from official websites may be subject to the Colorado
    Open Records Act (C.R.S. 24-72-201 et.seq.). In
    addition, CU-Boulder may disclose information to
    third parties when such disclosure is required
    or permitted by law.</p>
<p>This&nbsp; statement does not apply to websites
  that are created and maintained for purposes other
  than conducting official university business by individual
  faculty, staff or students using resources made available
  within a university domain.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Information</strong> </p>
<p>It is
  the practice of CU-Boulder to collect the least amount
  of personally identifiable information required to
  fulfill its duties and responsibilities, to complete
  a particular transaction, or as required by law.&nbsp; A
  wide variety of colleges, schools, departments, divisions,
  and other units contribute to CU-Boulder’s
  official web pages. Any website collecting personally
  identifiable information must include a privacy statement
  and&nbsp; collect
    only personally identifiable information required
    to fulfill the unit’s duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Information you provide will only be shared with
  individuals within the university community who need
  to know it in order to respond to your request, to
  provide services and to carry out university business.
  For the same reasons, CU-Boulder may also share your
  information with other people or organizations that
  provide services to CU-Boulder or help us provide
  services to you. CU-Boulder requires
  these individuals and organizations to protect your
  information according to this statement and applicable
  law. </p>
<p>You may choose whether or not to provide personal
  information to CU-Boulder via the Internet. If you
  choose not to provide personal information, you can
  still visit most CU-Boulder websites, but you may
  be unable to access certain options, offers, and
  services.</p>
<p>For website administration purposes, information,
  other than personally identifiable information, is
  collected for analysis. This information is used
  to help diagnose problems, assess what information
  is most of interest, determine technical design specifications,
  and identify system performance and/or problem areas,
  and other administrative functions. This information
  includes logs of user visits to CU-Boulder websites,
  network traffic logs necessary to insure security
  and optimum performance, and small text files called “cookies” used
  to keep track of settings.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Comments and Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Send comments or questions to <a href="mailto:webcom@colorado.edu">webcom@colorado.edu</a>.
  If you send comments, please include a mailing address.
  Do not send attachments with the message. (Due to
  concern about computer viruses and the damage they
  cause, e-mail messages containing attachments will
  be deleted without opening them.)</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>The information provided in this privacy statement
  should not be construed as giving business, legal
  or other advice, or as guaranteeing the security
  of information provided through CU-Boulder’s
  websites.&nbsp; </p>
