<p><font class="BIG"><b>DISCLAIMER</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">The County of Los Angeles Public
Library endeavors to develop and support collections, resources, and
services that meet the informational, educational and recreational
needs of a highly diverse public. The Library utilizes ever-expanding
technology and information networks. The County of Los Angeles Public
Library does not monitor and has no control over the information
accessed through the Internet and cannot be held responsible for its
content. As with other Library materials and services, restriction of
access to the Internet is the responsibility of the individual, or, as
in the case of a child, the parent/guardian.</p>

<p><font class="BIG"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></font></p>

information submitted to the County of Los Angeles Public Library is
public information under the laws of the State of California. Under
some circumstances, we may be required to disclose such information in
accordance with the California Public Records Act or other legal
requirements.</p>

<p align="justify">The following describes how information
may be collected depending on your activities at this Website:</p>

Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using or your
browser software and operating system. This information does not
identify you personally.</p>


<p><b>If you send E-mail to this Website:</b></p>

<p align="justify">By sending us an electronic mail

<p align="justify">The County of Los Angeles Public

submitting e-mail via our "feedback form" may be asked to provide their
names, addresses, e-mail addresses and other pertinent information to
ensure we can process and deliver the information requested. Other
information may be collected at these sites through questionnaires,
feedback forms or other means to enable us to determine a visitor's
interests with the goal of providing better service.</p>

the Website containing that document.</p>

<b>
