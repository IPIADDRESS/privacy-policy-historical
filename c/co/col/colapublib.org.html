    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This is the website for  the County of Los Angeles Public Library.&nbsp; We recognize the public's concern about  privacy on the Internet. This privacy statement establishes how information  gathered about you from your visit to our website will be used by this  website's operators.</p>
    <p>The following describes how information may be collected depending on your activities at this website.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Subject to Public Records Laws and Other Legal Requirements</h2>
    <p>As  an initial matter, please be advised that we are subject to the public records  laws of the State of California  ("California Public Records Act") and that much of the information  you submit to Los Angeles   County is public  information under these laws.&nbsp; Under some  circumstances, we may be required to disclose such information in accordance with  the California Public Records Act or other legal requirements.</p>
    
    <h2>If you read or download information:</h2>
    <p>We  may collect and store information for statistical purposes. For example, we may  count the number of visitors to the different sections of our site to help us  make them more useful.&nbsp; We may also use  this information to monitor your compliance with the <a href="/aboutus/termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a>.&nbsp; The  information collected may include such items as the name and domain of the host  from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the  computer you are using or your browser software and operating system.

    <p>Some  County department or agency websites may ask visitors who request specific  information to fill out a registration form. For example, vendors requesting  access to Requests for Bids, Requests for Proposals or homeowners or businesses  requesting Permits, may be asked to provide their names, addresses, e-mail  addresses and other pertinent information to ensure we can process and deliver  the information requested. Other information may be collected at these sites  through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, to enable us to determine  a visitor's interests, with the goal of providing better service.&nbsp; Please note that these methods also may not  be transmitted securely.</p>
