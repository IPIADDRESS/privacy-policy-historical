<p align="justify">The County of Los Angeles Public
Library endeavors to develop and support collections, resources, and
services that meet the informational, educational and recreational
needs of a highly diverse public. The Library utilizes ever-expanding
technology and information networks. The County of Los Angeles Public
Library does not monitor and has no control over the information
accessed through the Internet and cannot be held responsible for its
content. As with other Library materials and services, restriction of
access to the Internet is the responsibility of the individual, or, as
in the case of a child, the parent/guardian.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></font></p>

<p align="justify">The Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles

some circumstances, we may be required to disclose such information in
accordance with the California Public Records Act or other legal
requirements.</p>

ensure we can process and deliver the information requested. Other
information may be collected at these sites through questionnaires,
feedback forms or other means to enable us to determine a visitor's
