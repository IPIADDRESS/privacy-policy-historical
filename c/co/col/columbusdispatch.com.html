<h2>Dispatch Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>The Columbus Dispatch respects the privacy of visitors to our
Web site. We do not resell, trade or share any information provided by
our visitors with any other entity. All information, other than
information intended for publication, is confidential. Following is a
list of types of information that may be recorded on our site and the
purposes for which the information is used:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Cookies:</b> The Dispatch Web site sets cookies (<a href="cookie.html">what is a cookie?</a>) to track unique
viewings of advertisements. This helps us determine, for example,
whether an ad has been viewed 10 times by one person or 
one time by 10 different people. No user information is saved or
tracked as part of this effort. At other times we
may set other cookies for different purposes on our Web site. If so,
we will update this information to advise our visitors about the use
of those cookies. Other sites that we link to from our pages may set
their own cookies. The Dispatch has no control over these cookies, and
we suggest you contact the site in question if you have concerns. One such site is the Dispatch-Bloomberg personal finance page, which uses cookies as passwords for users who wish to take advantage of the portfolio feature.<br>
    It
should be noted that cookies <b>cannot</b> in any event contain
information other than that which you voluntarily provide. We cannot
use cookies to directly determine any private information about
you.</li>

<!--
<li><b>Guestbook:</b> We save guestbook entries as useful feedback from
our visitors. We do not publish or share any information from the
guestbook without consent of the author. All entries in the
guestbook are voluntary. Because of the volume of entries, we cannot
guarantee a response to any individual guestbook entry.</li>
-->
<li><b>Letters to the Editor:</b> Letters to the Editor are presumed
to be intended for publication. Identifying information provided with
the letter is used only for verification of the letter's
authenticity. Letter authors' real names, cities of residence, and
title (where applicable) are published along with the letter. Due to
the volume of letters we receive, we cannot guarantee either
publication or a personal response to any given letter.</li>

<li><b>Advertising submissions:</b> Personal information provided with
online classified advertising submissions is used only for
verification and billing purposes.</li>

<li><b>Electronic mail to staff members and departments:</b> Staff
members have broad discretion as to the handling of mail sent to their
individual accounts. The company does not have a policy of tracking or
recording such correspondence, except by the specific request of the
staff member in cases such as harassment. Electronic mail sent to
departments within The Dispatch, such as the Circulation Department,
is handled at the department's discretion. The Dispatch does not have
a policy of sharing contents of e-mail with any other entities. 
However, we reserve the right to disclose such correspondence as
necessary to protect the company's legal interests.</li>

<li><b>Standard Web server log files:</b> All accesses to our Web
servers are recorded by software standard to our Web server platform.
Machine IP address, file accessed and time of access are recorded.
This information is  used only for system load and
activity accounting. No user-based tracking records are kept.</li>

</ol>


<b>Shopping on Dispatch.com</b><p>


<b>Thank you for your interest in <i>Dispatch</i> <a href="http://shop.dispatch.com">products.</a> We want to make your credit-card purchase as secure as possible, and to ensure your privacy. Please read the following before you make a purchase:</b></p><p> 

</p><li> To process your order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, and telephone number. <p>
                                    
                                    The e-mail address and the password you choose will become your "identifier" -- we will use it to process and fulfill your order and to welcome you back to the site for future purchases. IF you choose to receive future e-mail notices about more Dispatch products, we will save your e-mail address for that purpose. If you do not choose to receive future e-mail notices, we will not use your information for anything other than to process your order. Your telephone number is needed in case we are unable to notify you by e-mail of any questions about your order. </p><p>

</p></li><li> <b>We will not</b> share any of the personal information you provide us with any other parties; nor will we sell or trade it. This data is solely the property of The Columbus Dispatch and is stored on a separate server that is accessible only to authorized personnel. <b>We do not</b> track individual behavior of our customers while they are using our shopping site. We will record only aggregate numbers of products purchased and general traffic patterns on the site; that information will be used only to help us continue to improve. Again, it will not be shared with or sold to any other parties.<p>

</p></li><li> Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology is used to encrypt and protect your credit card account information, and transactions are carried out on a secure server (please be sure that your own Web browser, such as Netscape or Explorer, is able to handle secure transactions). Products are billed to your account when they are shipped.<p>
  

</p></li><li> By ordering from our Web site, you consent to terms of this privacy policy. If you have concerns about this policy, please e-mail <a href="mailto:pcoffman@dispatch.com">Pam Coffman,</a> electronic publishing editor of The Dispatch, or phone her at 614-461-8869. We value your patronage and your privacy. <p>
