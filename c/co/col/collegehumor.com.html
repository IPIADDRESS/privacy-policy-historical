<p> <strong>Introduction</strong> </p>

<p>Connected Ventures, LLC and it parent companies and their affiliates (collectively, “Connected Ventures”) respect the privacy of the visitors to this web site and any co-branded, mirrored, or successor sites (the "Website") and are committed to protecting their privacy. Connected Ventures has established this Privacy Policy Statement to inform you of our policies and practices regarding how we collect personal identifiable information from you, how we use and disclose it, and your rights with respect to such information. By using this Website, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions of this Connected Ventures Privacy Policy Statement (“Privacy Policy”). If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this Website.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change or modify our privacy practices that are described herein from time to time simply by posting a revised Privacy Policy on this Website. Any such change shall be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy on this Website. We reserve the right to make the revised or changed Privacy Policy effective for information we already have about you, as well as any information we receive in the future. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy practices.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Policy </strong></p>

<p>Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use this Website. In general, you can visit many of the web pages on this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We, however, may track your Internet Protocol (IP) address and other anonymous information from your web browser for trends and statistics (including, but not limited to, browser version, pages requested and pages visited), but you will remain anonymous unless you provide us with personal information during your visit to this Website or during an earlier or subsequent visit and we are able to link your IP address between your current visit and one of these other visits.<strong></strong></p>

<p>We also work with service providers who use tracking technologies to serve ads across the Internet or track email communication response rates on our behalf. These companies may collect personal information<strong></strong>about your visits to this Website and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.<strong></strong></p>

<p>In addition to anonymous information, we also collect personal information from you at this Website when you voluntarily submit it to us.

<p>This Website may now or in the future include web logs (<em>i.e.</em>, blogs), chat rooms, post-it boards, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues, which you do at your own risk.
