Connected Ventures has established this Privacy Policy Statement to inform you of our policies and practices regarding how we collect personal identifiable information from you, how we use and disclose it, and your rights with respect to such information. By using this Website, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions of this Connected Ventures Privacy Policy Statement (“Privacy Policy”). If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this Website.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change or modify our privacy practices that are described herein from time to time simply by posting a revised Privacy Policy on this Website. Any such change shall be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy on this Website. We reserve the right to make the revised or changed Privacy Policy effective for information we already have about you, as well as any information we receive in the future.

<p>Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use this Website.

<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard and secure the transmission of your personal information from your computer to our computers.

<p> To help protect your computer and personal information, make sure you have current anti-virus and firewall software installed on your computer and update such software on a regular basis. Also, please review your credit card statement carefully and verify that all transactions are authorized and report any discrepancies immediately to your credit card company. </p>

<p><strong> Chat Rooms and Forums </strong></p>

<p>This Website may now or in the future include web logs (<em>i.e.</em>, blogs), chat rooms, post-it boards, forums, message boards, and/or news groups. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues, which you do at your own risk. If you do so, you may receive, among other things, unsolicited emails or "spam" from others. Connected Ventures cannot safeguard the privacy of personal information that is disclosed online in this manner. <strong></strong></p>
