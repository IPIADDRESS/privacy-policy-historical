<p>This Privacy Policy is effective on October 25, 2017.</p>

<p>Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy details Colorescience’s commitment to respecting the privacy of our customers and visitors to our Website and our other Services.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Colorescience collects, discloses, and uses the information you provide to us on our Website and our other Services. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. When we make revisions, we will post them on the Services and update the “Last Revised” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Revisions will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>

Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings set forth in the Terms of Use.</p>

We may combine the information we receive from and about you, including the information you provide to us, with information we receive from third parties, information we automatically collect (as explained above) and information provided or collected offline including when you use the Services.</p>

<p>For example, by registering for an Account, you may have the option to sign in using third party social networking websites ("Social Networks"), such as Facebook or Twitter. You may also have the option of connecting to Social Networks to complete your profile information and populate your Account with information from these networks. If you choose to sign in through these Social Networks or connect your Account to these Social Networks, we use the information you have already provided to such Social Networks in registering for an account with such Social Networks and which you have allowed such Social Networks to share with Colorescience, including, but not limited to, your first name, your user profile picture, your friends and contacts list, your gender, and the networks to which you belong (collectively, your "Submitted Information"). You expressly authorize us to collect and use your Submitted Information in connection with your use of the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that Colorescience may, but is not obligated to, maintain copies of your Submitted Information indefinitely, or delete any or all Submitted Information, at our sole discretion. We advise you to carefully read to the terms of use and privacy policies of Social Networks. It is your responsibility to read and accept the respective Social Networks policies prior to creating or signing into your Account through a Social Network.</p>

<p>As is true of most websites and similar services, we automatically gather information about your computer or device from which you access the Services, such as your IP address, browser type, time and date of visit, referring/exit pages and operating system.

This information does not directly personally identify you or any user. If Colorescience engages in a joint promotion with an affiliate and/or partner, we may share your personal information with our affiliate and/or partner to be used in relation to the promotion, and you will have the opportunity to opt-out out of such promotional communications.</p>

<p>If Colorescience is involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event that Colorescience goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, your personal information may be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by the third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Colorescience or its assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

<h3>Web Tracking Technologies</h3>

<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Services, or interact with our emails on or from our Services or other websites. This information may include your IP address, browser type, geolocation data, unique user ID, cell phone model, operating system and carrier, and Internet Service Provider.

These technologies (including cookies on the Website) allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on our Services, recognize registered users when they visit, and provide registered customers with information and advertising that is more relevant to them. If you register with or order from us, we may use cookies or other technology to monitor and maintain information about how you use our Services and what you buy. If you do not register with or order from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of the Website in order to improve your shopping experience and provide you with more relevant products, content and advertising.

We may use cookies to collect browsing data to keep track of your preferences and profile information and to collect general usage and volume statistical information. You may set your Internet web browser to refuse cookies or to remove cookies from your hard drive.</p>

<h3>Web Beacons</h3>

<p>Our Services contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>We may use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Services. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our Services are used.</p>

<p>We may partner with third party ad network(s) to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our ad network partner(s) may use cookies and/or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Services and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests. Our system may not respond to Do Not Track requests or headers from some or all browsers.</p>

<p>We may also use services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to assist in providing the Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Services. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Services (including your IP address) will be transmitted to, and stored by, Google on their servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Services, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Services. By using these Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We will not store your complete credit card information on our servers, but will only use an incomplete identifier (e.g., last four digits of your credit card number) to identify your Account. Any complete credit card information you choose to store in connection with your Account will be stored by our third party payment processing service providers such as Authorize.net.</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us at the address listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>

<p>Targeted Advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. We may work with third parties by placing or accessing cookies in your browser when you visit this, or other, websites and thus being able to better serve you relevant, targeted advertising to you based on your viewing history.</p>
