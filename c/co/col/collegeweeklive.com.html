</p>

When you share social media information with us by connecting your social media account to our Site, you will be given a description of what may be collected. Each social network provides different types of information. For example, Facebook may provide your username, likes, public posts, and other basic data, while Twitter may offer your username, tweets, and basic profile. When you sign in to your account or mobile application with your social media account information, or otherwise connect to your social media account with the Services, you consent to our collection, storage, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of the information that you choose to make available to us through the social media interface.

</p>
<p><u>Information Collected Passively, Through Technology</u>
</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
  <br> We collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, when you visit our Site. The information we collect in this manner includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Site (such as what pages you view, and what links you click on), and dates and times of Site visits.
</p>
<p>A cookie is a text file that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag or pixel tag, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Using these tools, we obtain clickstream data, which is a log of the content you visit while browsing our Site.
</p>
<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can often change your browser settings to prevent these cookies from collecting your personal information. Disabling cookies does not necessarily disable the use of pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies that collect information about your use of the Site.
</p>
<p><strong>Locally Stored Objects</strong>
  <br> The Services may employ locally stored objects ("LSOs") and other client-side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website, or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Adobe's website</a> directly. In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.
</p>
<p>2. Our Use of the Information
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may use the Information you provide to us for the following purposes:
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>By collecting information through cookies, web beacons and other automated means, we learn how to improve and customize this Site for our visitors. We may use cookies and similar technologies to customize your visit to our Site and deliver content consistent with your interests and the manner in which you browse the Site. We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Site. We also may use IP addresses to help identify visitors to our Site for the duration of a session and to gather demographic information about our visitors. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each web page of our Site, how visitors navigate through the Site, and how we may tailor our Site to better meet the needs of our visitors. We also use the information for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including the enforcement of our Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>We may use any of the above Information in de-identified, anonymized or aggregated form for online marketing, including to show you (or help other companies to show you) display ads that may be more relevant to you. Sometimes, this involves sharing de-identified or anonymous identifiers with partners, such as advertising or other media platforms.

<ul>
  <li>We may share the Information with service providers who help us deliver the services you request, such as (but not limited to) hosting providers, chat room personnel and operators, credit card processors, technology and customer support services, analytics providers, market research and data management or data enhancement services. We furnish service providers with the information needed for them to perform these services.</li>
  <li>We may share the Information with our corporate affiliates, advertising and marketing companies and platforms that may wish to target you with products that may be relevant to your described interests or demographic profile, and other institutions that may wish to market to you directly (such as through direct mail, display media or email channels). For instance, this may include (but is not limited to) colleges and universities you have expressed an interest in, colleges and universities that are similar to those institutions, and other marketers that sell products related to the college and university experience.</li>
  <li>We may share with third parties certain anonymized or aggregated statistics about our users and their behavior while visiting our Site. We may include such data in reports made available to third parties, or to the general public. These reports will not identify individual users.</li>

We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose any Information to the requesting agency in doing so.</li>
  <li>If we or all or substantially all of our assets, are purchased by another company (such as in a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of stock and/or assets, or other corporate change or financing transaction), the Information in our possession will likely be transferred to the successor entity. We also may share the Information during the course of any due diligence process.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>4. Information About Other People
</p>
<p>On some pages, you can submit information about other people. such as your parent or guidance counselor. We may use this information to contact these people about content, opportunities and events that may be relevant to (as applicable) you or them.
</p>
<p>5. Your Choices
</p>
<p>We may offer you certain choices in connection with the information we collect, use and share. As noted above, some information that we collect from you is required to enable you to register with and use the site. Other information is optional. Where practical, we may enable you to control the types and frequency of marketing and promotional materials you receive from us. However, unless otherwise expressly agreed, you should presume that we collect, use and share your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You may "opt out" of receiving or unsubscribe to marketing and promotional materials via email at any time by calling us at 1 (888) 697-0050, emailing us at support@collegeweeklive.com or by clicking on the Unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you and following the resulting instructions.

</p>
<p>We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks, servers and platform) to serve tailored advertising to you on the Services or on other websites or in other mobile applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device you use to access the Services. We may also use third parties to retarget ads to you about our own Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed by third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
</p>
<p>6. Children Under 13
</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not use our Services. If you learn of someone under 13 that has submitted personal information to us, please contact us, so that we may delete that personal information from our database.
