<h3>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS: MARKETING AND "DO NOT TRACK"</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may opt-out of our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To opt out, please contact us at <a href="mailto:CAprivacy@collegebound.net">CAprivacy@collegebound.net</a>.</p>

<p>California residents may choose to opt-out of the sharing of their personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request in writing to The CollegeBound Network, Compliance Department, 1200 South Ave., Staten Island, NY 10314 or by e-mailing us the request at: <a href="mailto:CAprivacy@collegebound.net">CAprivacy@collegebound.net</a>. We honor all such opt-out requests and it is our policy not to share personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes where you have submitted such a request. It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes.</p>

<p>California law requires that we disclose how our site responds to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals from browsers and other mechanism that express the user's preference not to be tracked.  Currently, there is not an industry-wide accepted definition of what is a DNT signal. For this reason, we currently do not respond to such signals.</p>

<h3>COOKIES AND DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p>We may use third party advertisements to support our Site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (collectively, "Data Collection Technologies") when they advertise on our Site, which may send these advertisers information including your non-personal information.</p>

<p>You are free to set your Internet browser to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>

<p>Our Site also uses Data Collection Technologies to help manage our online advertising program. These Data Collection Technologies are provided by our ad management partners and other third parties.</p>
 
<p>In addition, we and our ad management partners may use these Data Collection Technologies to track the actions of users of the Site, to improve our products and services, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver advertisements on our Site or on other websites across the Internet that may be more relevant to individual consumers.</p>
 
<p>We support the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Interest-Based Advertising ("Principles").  This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes.

If you delete cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again.</p>
<p>Please note that when you "opt-out" of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on the Site.
