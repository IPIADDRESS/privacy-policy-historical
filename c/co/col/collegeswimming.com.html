about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded
Partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to
both us and the Co-Branded Partner; or we may share your
information with the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the

your information.</li>
<li>CollegeSwimming continues to expand its online presence in
order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences.
Where permitted by law, we may share information we collect
about you with any affiliate companies, so that we can provide
you with information about products and services that might
interest you.</li>
<li>We may share your information in connection with a substantial
business transaction, such as the sale of CollegeSwimming, a
merger, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
bankruptcy.</li>
<li>We may disclose your information when we have a reasonable and
good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce
the terms of use of the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding,
court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or
protect CollegeSwimming’s rights under applicable law, including
without limitation, CollegeSwimming’s intellectual property
rights. In this situation, we will use reasonable efforts to
provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the
extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.</li>

CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left:0in;mso-add-space:auto; text-align:justify"><br>
CollegeSwimming is committed to protecting the privacy of
children who use our sites and applications. This Children’s
Online Privacy Policy explains our information collection,
disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to
information provided by children under the age of 13 (“child” or
“children”), and uses terms that are defined in our general
Privacy Policy. This policy is in accordance with the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). For more
information about COPPA and general tips about protecting
children’s online privacy, please visit <a href="http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online">OnGuard











Online</a>.<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM
CHILDREN, HOW WE USE IT, AND HOW AND WHEN WE COMMUNICATE WITH
PARENTS. CollegeSwimming offers to its users a range of
activities and services, some of which may collect information
from children. Below, we summarize potential instances of
collection and outline how and when we will provide parental
notice and/or seek parental consent. In any instance that we
collect personal information from a child, we will retain that
information only so long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill
the activity request or allow the child to continue to
participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our
users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we
discover we have collected information from a child in a
manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will use
commercially reasonable efforts delete the information or
immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Registration. Children can, in many cases, register with
the Site and applications to view content, play games, log
information, provide results, input data, participate in
contests, and engage in special features, among other
things. During the registration process, we may ask the
child to provide certain information for notification and
security purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email
address, the child’s first name and gender, the child’s
member or account username, and password. We also may ask
for birth dates from children to validate their ages. Please
note that children can choose whether to share their
information with us, but certain features may not function
without it. As a result, children may not be able to access
certain features if required information has not been
provided. We will not require a child to provide more
information than is reasonably necessary in order to
participate in an online activity.</li>
<ul>
<li>Collection of parent email addresses: Consistent with
the requirements of COPPA, in any instance in which we ask
for age and determine the user is a child, we will ask for
a parent or guardian email address before we collect any
personal information from the child. If you believe your
child is participating in an activity that collects
personal information and you or another parent/guardian
have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking
your consent, please feel free to contact us at privacy
@swimcloud.com. We will not use parent emails provided for
parental consent purposes to market to the parent, unless
the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or
has separately participated in an activity that allows for
such email contact.</li>
</ul>
<li>&nbsp;Content Generated by a Child. Certain activities on
the Site and applications may allow children to create or
manipulate content and save it with CollegeSwimming. Some of
these activities do not require children to provide any
personal information and therefore may not result in notice
to the parent or require parental consent. If an activity
potentially allows a child to insert personal information in
their created content, we will either pre-screen the
submission to delete any personal information, or we will
seek verifiable parental consent by email for the
collection. Examples of created content that may include
personal information are stories or other open-text fields,
drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information,
or photo submissions. If, in addition to collecting content
that includes personal information, CollegeSwimming also
plans to post the content publicly or share it with a third
party for the third party’s own use, we will obtain a higher
level of parental consent.</li>
<ul>
<li>About Verifiable Parental Consent:</li>
<ul>
<li>Email Consent. In the event CollegeSwimming wishes to
collect personal information from a child, COPPA
requires that we first seek a parent or guardian’s
consent by email. In the email we will explain what
information we are collecting, how we plan to use it,
how the parent can provide consent, and how the parent
can revoke consent. If we do not receive parental
consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the
parent contact information and any other information
collected from the child in connection with that
activity.</li>
<li>High-Level Consent. In the event CollegeSwimming
collects personal information from a child that will be
posted publicly, we will seek a higher level of consent
than email consent. Such “high-level” methods of consent
may include, without limitation, asking for a credit
card or other payment method for verification (with a
nominal charge potentially involved), speaking to a
trained representative by telephone or video chat,
requiring a signed consent form by mail, email
attachment, or fax, or checking a form of
government-issued identification against databases of
such information, provided that the parent’s
identification shall be deleted promptly after such
verification is complete. After providing high-level
consent, a parent may have the opportunity to use a pin
or password in future communications as a way to confirm
the parent’s </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>CHAT. Certain activities may allow users to communicate
directly with other users by means of a chat system. We may
employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag
inappropriate communications to prevent the communication of
both personal information and age-inappropriate words and
phrases. We strongly encourage children who use these
interactive features never to provide personal information
about themselves or any third party, and certainly never to
attempt to circumvent our moderation. We recommend that
parents carefully supervise their children when the children
participate in online activities.</li>
<li>CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES. For contests and sweepstakes, we
typically require only the information necessary for a child
to participate, such as first name (to distinguish among
family members) and parent email address (to notify the
parent where required by law). We only contact the parent
for more personalized information for prize-fulfillment
purposes when the child wins the contest or sweepstakes. Of
course, some contests and sweepstakes ask the child to
submit their own created content along with the child’s
entry. In those instances, we may require parental consent
prior to submission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall
not condition a child’s participation in a contest or
sweepstakes, the offering of a prize, or another activity on
the child’s disclosing more personal information than is
reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.</li>
<li>EMAIL CONTACT WITH A CHILD. On occasion, in order to
respond to a question or request from a child,
CollegeSwimming may need to ask for the child’s online
contact information, such as an email address.
CollegeSwimming will delete this information immediately
after responding to the question or request. In connection
with certain activities or services, we may collect a
child’s online contact information, such as an email
address, in order to communicate with the child more than
once. In such instances, we will retain the child’s online
contact information to honor the request and for no other
purpose such as marketing. Whenever we collect a child’s
online contact information for ongoing communications, we
will simultaneously require a parent email address in order
to notify the parent about the collection and use of the
child’s information, as well as to provide the parent an
opportunity to prevent further contact with the child. On
some occasions, a child may be engaged in more than one
ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to
“opt-out” of each communication individually.</li>
<li>PERSISTENT IDENTIFIERS. When children interact with us,
certain information may automatically be collected, both to
make the Site and applications more interesting and useful
and for various purposes related to CollegeSwimming.
Examples include the type of computer operating system, the
child’s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web
browser, the frequency with which the child visits various
parts of our Site or applications, and information regarding
the online or mobile service provider. This information is
collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies,
web beacons, and other unique identifiers. This information
may be collected by CollegeSwimming or by a third party.
This data is principally used for internal purposes only, in
order to:</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->provide users with access to
features and activities on our Site and applications</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the event we collect (or allow
others to collect) such information from children on the Site
and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and
obtain consent prior to such collection.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->WHEN INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM
CHILDREN IS AVAILABLE TO OTHERS. In addition to those rare
instances where a child’s personal information is posted
publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we
also may share or disclose personal information collected from
children in a limited number of instances, including the
following:</li>
<ol>
<li>We may share information with our service providers if
necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or
technology support function for us.</li>
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->We may disclose personal
information if permitted or required by law, for example, in
response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal
information collected from children (a)&nbsp;in response to
a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or
children services) request; (b)&nbsp;if we believe
disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime,
facilitate an investigation related to public safety or
protect the safety of a child using our Site or
applications; (c)&nbsp;to protect the security or integrity
of our Site, applications, and other technology, as well as
the technology of our service providers; or (d)&nbsp;to
enable us to take precautions against liability.</li>
</ol>
<li>PARENTAL RIGHT TO REVIEW PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CHILD. Upon
request of a parent whose child has provided personal
information, we will provide the following:</li>
<ol>
<li>A description of the specific types or categories of
personal information collected from children by
CollegeSwimming, such as name, address, telephone number,
email address, hobbies, and extracurricular activities;</li>
<li>The opportunity at any time to refuse to permit our
further use or future online collection of personal
information from that child, and to direct us to delete the
child’s personal information; and</li>
<li> A means of reviewing any personal information collected
from the child.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify">Prior to disclosing any such
information, we shall use reasonable procedures to
(a)&nbsp;ensure that the requestor is a parent of that child,
and (b) not be unduly burdensome to the parent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">If a parent has refused to permit
CollegeSwimming’s further use or collection of personal
information from his or her child or has directed
CollegeSwimming to delete the child’s personal information, we
retain the right to terminate any services provided to such
child.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><!--[if !supportLists]-->CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY AND
INTEGRITY. We have established and will maintain reasonable
procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and
integrity of personal information collected from children. We
will also take reasonable steps to release children’s personal
information only to service providers and third parties who
are capable of maintaining the confidentiality, security and
integrity of such information, and who provide assurances that
they will maintain the information in such a manner.</li>
<li>PARENTAL CHOICES AND CONTROLS. At any time, parents can
refuse to permit us to collect further personal information
from their children, and can request that we delete from our
records the personal information we have collected from their
children. Inquiries may be directed to:</li>
