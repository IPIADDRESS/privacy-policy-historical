                        <h2>Collective Media</h2>
                        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>We at Collective Media view the protection of individual privacy as critically important. Collective Media's combination of proprietary and partner technology allows us to deliver relevant, targeted content to individuals, but not at the expense of individual privacy.</p> 
                        <p>What follows is a description of Collective Media's overall policy. For more details on our practices, please <a href="mailto:privacy@collective-media.com" title="Contact Us">contact us</a>.</p> 
                        <p><strong>Company Practices</strong><br>
                        The following statement describes the overall company practices of Collective Media, including advertising on our network of websites, as well as across other internal sites, and products and services that are offered by Collective Media. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Collective Media does not own or control, or to people that Collective Media does not employ.</p>
                        <h4>Information Collected By Collective Media</h4>
                        <p><strong>Non-Personally-Identifiable Consumer Data</strong><br>
                        Collective Media delivers advertisements across multiple channels and media, including to users who visit any of the websites that are a part of Collective Media's network. With respect to individuals who visit those sites, we collect what is known as "Click Stream Data." Click Stream Data is anonymous, and includes information such as a user's IP address, web pages which have been viewed by a user, date and time, domain type, and responses by a user to an advertisement delivered by us. We use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels).</p>
                        <p><strong>Other Information that is Collected</strong><br>
                        At some Collective Media Properties, including this one, Collective Media collects personal information on individuals and companies who want to enter into business relationships with Collective Media ("business information"). An example of this would include web publishers who want to become a part of Collective Media's site network. We maintain business information for purposes of administering the program, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc. We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.</p>

                        <p><strong>How Collected Information is Used</strong><br>
                        The non-personally identifiable data that Collective Media collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a personally relevant experience for each person. The data is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.</p> 
                        <p>If a consumer elects to provide Collective Media with personally identifiable data, we may utilize such data for marketing purposes. In addition, that data may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to that consumer's preferences and behaviors, and for other Collective Media sales and marketing efforts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sharing With Third Parties</strong><br>
                        All personally identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in confidence by Collective Media. There are instances, however, in which personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.</p> 
                        <p>The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Collective Media on an anonymous basis.</p>
                        <p>With respect to personally identifiable information, Collective Media may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing a Collective Media product or service. Any third-party vendor so used will be required to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Collective Media.</p>
                        <p>Collective Media may also share personally identifiable information with third parties who enter into business relationships with us. These business partners may include financial service providers (including credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors, direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and others such as non-profit organizations. We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Collective Media is very careful about which companies it does business with.</p>
                        <p>The ads appearing in this network may be delivered to you by DoubleClick, one of our Web advertising partners. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad, is used to serve ads to you. In the course of serving advertisements, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click here.</p> 
                        <p>In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that Collective Media, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Collective Media may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.</p>
                        <p><strong>Security Precautions</strong><br>
                        Collective Media makes significant efforts to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. We use various technologies, including, in certain instances, encryption, to ensure the high security standards. Any data that is stored on Collective Media's servers is treated as confidential and is not generally available to the public. Collective Media has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who we reasonably believe need to know such information for the purpose of performing their jobs. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium. Therefore, although we use reasonable efforts to protect information, the possibility of somebody defeating our security measures does exist.</p>
                        <h4>Consumer Choice</h4>
                        <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Data - Use of Cookies &amp; Opting-Out</strong><br>
                        Collective Media uses technology, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels), to deliver better, targeted marketing messages to the user. These tools are used to collect anonymous data, and in some instances where personally identifiable information has been provided by a user, to provide better and more relevant services and messages to that user. We believe that the use of such tools assists in providing a more meaningful web-browsing experience, but you may opt-out of the use of Collective Media cookies if you would like. To do so, you can disable cookies on your browser.</p> 
                        <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Consumer Data - Opt-Out</strong><br>
                        If a consumer elects to provide Collective Media with personally identifiable data, he or she has the right to tell us not to make some of the uses of such data described herein or may have such data deleted in its entirety at any time. Simply contact us and provide the name of the service for which you provided information and let us know what level of opt-out you would like to exercise. These include: (1) Do not share information about me with business partners, (2) Do not solicit me with special offers other than those related to the service I signed up for, or (3) Remove my data from your database for such service completely. Once we receive this instruction, we will promptly take corrective action. Please note that we will need you to provide your email address or other previously provided personal identifier in order to identify you in the Data Opt-Out process. Also, please remember that if you choose to delete your information completely you will no longer receive the Collective Media service in question.</p>
                        <p><strong>Access to Data</strong><br>
                        Collective Media allows consumers who have voluntarily provided personally identifiable data access to their data to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes. <a href="/contact.php" title="contact us">contact us</a>.</p>
                        <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
                        <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong><br>
                        Collective Media is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy. Collective Media's websites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. If you believe your child has provided Collective Media with personally identifiable data, or registered at one of Collective Media's websites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.</p>
                        <p><strong>A Special Note About the European Union</strong><br>
                        European Union users understand and consent to the processing of personal information in the United States. 
                        </p><p><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                        The issue of privacy is an evolving one. Collective Media is committed to the constant monitoring and examination of its privacy practices, and may, from time to time, institute changes to its Privacy Policy. In the event that any material changes are made to the company's privacy practices, we will promptly make changes to this privacy policy that discloses the changes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effective Date</strong><br>
                        This Privacy Policy has been in effect since August 1, 2005.</p>
