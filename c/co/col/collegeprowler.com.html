<p><b>III.</b> <b>With whom we share your information</b></p>
<p><b><i>A. Per your instruction or use of the Services/Consents:</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share all categories of your personal information to selected outside companies, either by selling it or otherwise transferring it, to advertisers and other business partners that assist us in providing you with meaningful and relevant Services (each, collectively an “Advertiser”). Our Advertisers include realtors, loan providers and other complementary service companies, schools, work places, and social media platforms such as Facebook. The sharing of your personal information with these Advertisers is conducted in accordance with the contact preferences that you set when you create your user profile, or when you express an interest in any content displayed on our Site, or when you enter a response to any affirmative authorization that you provide by typing it in a space provided or clicking on an icon designed to show your interest in an item on the web page or in the app.&nbsp; In certain cases, we may ask on behalf of an Advertiser that you have expressed an interest in for your express written consent to receive marketing autodialed or pre-recorded calls or text messages at a phone number you designate. Your consent to such requests is not required as a condition for use of the Niche Services and you can opt out from such calls or texts at any time by following the instructions in such calls or text messages, or by contacting the particular Advertiser directly. Standard message and data rates may apply to calls or texts based on your plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, any personal information you share publicly through our Site may be indexed through third party search engines, such as Google or Bing. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your information, including any outdated information. You acknowledge that personal</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">information that you submit when you participate in an opinion survey or user review, a blog or any online message board that we provide through our Site or Services may be available, via the Internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such personal</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">information by others, nor can we ensure it is deleted if you later ask us to delete your personal information as provided for in this Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i>B. Third party processors:</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use third party processors (including contractors and service providers) to provide our web and app services and to help with our operations on our behalf (“Processors”). These Processors need access to and use of your personal information, and include third parties to provide us with technical support, to give us additional personal data about you, and to perform analytics and other work that we may need to outsource. These Processors are bound by law and/or contract to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.&nbsp; They only process your personal information to provide requested services for us, and only act on our documented instructions. In addition, we use certain third party Processors, such as Google’s reCAPTCHA service, to validate login credentials of individuals and to frustrate bots; in these cases, your privacy rights are determined by the Processor’s privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also share all categories of your personal information with other business partners that perform certain functions for us (“Business Partners”).&nbsp; These Business Partners are themselves responsible to determine the purposes and/or means of the processing your personal information and for the lawfulness of that processing.&nbsp; They include insurance companies, financial institutions, and other professional advisors.</span></p>
<p><b><i>C. Third party websites</i></b><b>:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide links to other websites, such as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter and Google), or our third party partner websites (such as scholarship providers, schools, and Business Partners), and these other websites may provide links to our Site. Third party sites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies and Niche has no control over these third party websites.</span><b><i> If you wish to opt-out of any information sharing conducted by any third party website that you link to from us, or to us from them, you must do so in accordance with their specific opt-out policies and procedures.</i></b> <b><i>By using our Site and Services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of such third-party sites, and do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites. You further acknowledge and agree that Niche will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>D. De-identified information about you</i></b><b>:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also share aggregated or de-identified information (i.e., information that does not personally identify you directly), or statistical information about you, including statistical data and historical use data, with others for a variety of purposes, including for their own uses, for example, for improving their services for you and others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i>E. As required by law or legitimate business interest</i></b><b>:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we may disclose any or all categories of your personal information where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person. Likewise, we may disclose all such categories of your personal information to our professional advisers as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. Further, we may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger or similar transaction involving sale or transfer of some or all of our business or assets. If another company acquires our company or assets, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><b>IV. Your choices and opting out</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to request that we do not sell your personal information to Advertisers. If, at some point after giving us your personally identifiable information, you wish to limit the sale of your information to our third party Advertisers, or you no longer desire to continue to receive additional information from us about Niche and our Advertisers, you may have the ability to “opt out” by emailing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support@niche.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and putting the words “remove my name” in the subject line of your email. In the case of our email newsletters, you may opt out by clicking on the “opt out” link at the end of each email. If you agree to receive autodialed or pre-recorded calls and/or text messages from an Advertiser and later wish to opt-out, you should follow the direction in such call(s) or text message(s) or contact the school or other Advertiser directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, you cannot opt out of our sharing of your personal information with our Processors or Business Partners, or our sharing of deidentified information, or your personal information as required by law or legitimate business interests, as described in Sections III.

<p><b><i>A special note about your telephone number</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – By providing your telephone number to us, you agree that this action constitutes an “inquiry” for purposes of telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or mobile number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry or your State Do-Not-Call list, </span><b><i>you are providing your express written consent to receive future information (including telemarketing) about products and services from us, and you hereby agree and consent to our contacting you using the information you have provided and will provide to us.

You are not required to agree to this consent in order to obtain Services through us. This consent may be revoked by you at any time and by any reasonable means, including by emailing us at support@niche.com and putting the words “remove my telephone number” in the subject line of your email, or by telephoning us at 1-(844)-452-7758</i></b><b><i>.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please refer to the <a href="https://www.niche.com/about/terms/">Niche User Agreement</a> for additional information regarding telephone consent.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Special rule for users under 16 years of age</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – So long as we have actual knowledge that you are under the age of 16, we will not sell your personally identifiable information to our Advertisers unless you “opt in” by requesting us to do so. You can opt in to information sharing with Advertisers by requesting that we share your information with schools for which you have expressed an interest or with parties that you wish to be considered for a scholarship.

<p><b>X. A note about Children</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Niche Site or Services and we do not intentionally collect or maintain personal information from those who are under 13 years old.

By using the Niche Site or Services, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents’ permission to use the website and any Services offered by us.</span></p>
<p><b>XI. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</b></p>
<p><b>(AS PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1798.83)</b></p>
<p><b>A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHO HAS PROVIDED PERSONAL DATA TO A BUSINESS WITH WHOM HE/SHE HAS ESTABLISHED A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP FOR PERSONAL, FAMILY, OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES (A “CALIFORNIA CUSTOMER”) MAY REQUEST INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THE BUSINESS HAS DISCLOSED PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTIES FOR THE THIRD PARTIES’ DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES. IN GENERAL, IF THE BUSINESS HAS MADE SUCH A DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA, UPON RECEIPT OF A REQUEST BY A CALIFORNIA CUSTOMER, THE BUSINESS IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A LIST OF ALL THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM PERSONAL DATA WAS DISCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, AS WELL AS A LIST OF THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA THAT WERE DISCLOSED. CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS MAY REQUEST FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW BY CONTACTING US BY EMAIL AT</b> <b><i>support@niche.com</i></b><b>, OR BY WRITING TO US AT </b><b><i>2840 Liberty</i></b><b><i> Avenue, Suite 202, Pittsburgh, PA. 15222 C/O “CA PRIVACY”</i></b><b>, or by calling us at the toll free number </b><b>(844)-452-7758.</b><b> PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO UP TO TWO REQUESTS PER CALIFORNIA CUSTOMER EACH YEAR AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS MADE BY MEANS OTHER THAN THROUGH THIS E-MAIL OR STREET ADDRESS OR TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE NUMBER.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except as provided in Section III, above, we do not share your personal information collected by us with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without giving you the opportunity to opt out as more fully described above in Section IV. If you are a California resident, you may request information about our compliance with California law by calling us toll free at (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">844)-452-7758</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, emailing us, or by sending a letter to us at the number and/or address shown above in Section IX, addressed to “Attention: California Privacy Matters.”&nbsp; Any such request must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the subject line and include your name, street address, city, state and ZIP code.

We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason, including our business reasons or in order to comply with changing privacy laws.
