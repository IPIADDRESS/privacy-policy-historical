Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.</p><p>We use cookies to understand Site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Site. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.</p><p>We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Site. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising.</p><p>The Adobe Flash Player is a powerful application and web tool that allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. This Site may employ locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) in certain situations where we use Flash to provide special content such as video streaming, video on demand, video clips or animation. Flash (and similar applications) use this technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Adobe’s websit</a>e&nbsp;directly.</p><p>We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Site or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Site or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Site. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).</p></div><h3>HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>At this time, this Site does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at the Site. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.</p></div><h3>ANALYTICS</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and website and mobile application analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may also place web beacons or similar technologies for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.</p></div><h3>AD CHOICES</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>Our goal at the Site is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Site is known. Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience on the Site. As part of this process we, the Turner Affiliates, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners may collect information about your online activities on the Site and other sites, and supplement such information with information from third parties, in an effort to make inferences about your interests and deliver to you advertisements targeted to those interests.</p><p>For example, if you often visit content on another Turner site about travel, we may use “web beacons” to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these technologies use anonymous identifiers within the “cookies” stored in your browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our&nbsp;Ad Choices&nbsp;page.</p></div><h3>TURNER'S PARTICIPATION IN THE INDUSTRY SELF REGULATORY PROGRAM FOR INTEREST BASED ADS; ADDITIONAL CHOICE OPTIONS</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>Turner is a participant in the online industry’s self regulatory program administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (the “DAA”) and has agreed to adhere to the DAA’s principles applicable to interest-based ads. Please visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Self Regulatory Program</a>&nbsp;for more information about the DAA, the self regulatory principles and choices you can make regarding interest-based ads.</p><p>You may also find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">NAI site</a>.</p><p>The tools provided on the&nbsp;Ad Choices&nbsp;page, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">DAA opt-out page</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">NAI opt-out page</a>&nbsp;are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.</p></div><h3>MOBILE DEVICE ADVERTISING AND TRACKING</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners may also be collecting identifiers designed to enable advertising on your mobile device. However, depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, when using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.</p></div><h3>LINKED SITES</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>Our Site may contain links to or integrations with other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p></div><h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>Turner operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using this Site you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this privacy statement.</p></div><h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.</p><p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy statement.</p></div><h3>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION</h3><div class="rich-text"><p>Access to personally identifiable information that is collected from our Site and that we maintain may be available to you.
