If you are under 13, please do not use our Website. If we find out we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information about a child under 13, we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible.</p>
        <h2>3. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
        <p>The Company and/or our third-party advertising or technology vendors may collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information using various tracking technologies described in this privacy policy. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is anonymous and includes information such as IP address, web pages which have been viewed, search queries that have been submitted, education interests, date and time, domain type, and responses by a visitor to an advertisement and content delivered by us or a third party advertising or technology vendor. The Company and our business partners may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1x1 pixels). Additionally, when registering for the site or requesting education information from one of our business partners on the Website, we may collect additional non-personally identifiable information about the individual. Examples of the non-personally identifiable data that may be requested include gender, ethnicity, military status, education background, geographic location and other information. None of this information (collectively referred to as "non-personally identifiable information"), by itself, or together with other non-personally identifiable information, can by its nature be matched with a specific individual. We have no access or control of third party tracking technologies.</p>
        <h2>4. Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
        <p>Personally Identifiable Information, as used in this Website Privacy Policy, means any information or set of information that identifies a specific individual. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address and email address, and phone numbers (home, mobile, office, and/or fax numbers). The Company generally collects this information on the Website to match you with educational opportunities, personalize content and to allow the user to request contact from educational institutions. Providing your personal information is always voluntary, and you can always choose not to provide your personal information by choosing not to use our Website. By providing your personal information, you acknowledge and consent to our use of such information in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>5. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
        <p>During the course of the visitor's use of the Website, we automatically collect certain information on the Website through cookies, web beacons, log files, and other common Website data collection techniques and we receive information from third parties.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Website Cookies:</strong> The Website may place "cookies" on a visitor's computer. Cookies are small text files. Our Cookies save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing the Website to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions. </p>
        <p>The Website uses both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until they expire or are manually deleted.</p>
        <p>The Website also contains coding from our business and technology partners which generates third-party cookies. Third-party cookies allow our business and technology partners to store non-Personally Identifiable Information they can access when you visit this or other Websites.</p>
        <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and provide the ability to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are the Website.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Web Beacons (1x1 Pixels or GIFS):</strong> Our Website contains coding known as Web Beacons that use 1x1 pixel images to capture and transmit the online activity of users on our Website. These Web Beacons typically transmit information about form completions and other Website activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness or store analytics information. In addition, the Company may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Log Files:</strong> Like most Websites, our servers utilize log files. Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our Website.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third-Party Information:</strong> We may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive updated or corrected contact information from third party vendors as part of vendors' fraud detection services. We may also receive information about you from third-party accounts. On some of our sites, you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. All information received from these third-party sources is utilized in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>6. Information You Provide to the Company</h2>
        <p>In addition to the information automatically collected automatically, we also collect information that you provide to us when you register for an account on our Website, request information about a particular school or educational program, or otherwise voluntarily provide information about yourself and/or your educational interests.</p>
        <p>Most commonly, our Website provides users the opportunity to request information from schools and to learn about various education opportunities. These information request pages require users to provide the Company with contact information (name, address, phone numbers [home, work and mobile], email address, age, work experience, military history, etc.) as well as information about their interest in one or more of our education or business partners (universities, colleges, test preparation companies, financial aid providers, etc.). We collect this information that you provide and may use it to make your future requests from our Websites easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have provided. We share this contact information that you provide with the education or business partner that you requested information from and that information usage is covered by their Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>Testimonials</h3>
        <p>From time to time, we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>
        <h3>Public Forums</h3>
        <p>Our Website offers publicly accessible blogs. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:%20privacy@cunet.com">privacy@cunet.com</a> or the mailing address provided at the end of this document. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why </p>
