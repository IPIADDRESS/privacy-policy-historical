<p class="PageTitle">CUnet, LLC Privacy Policy</p>

<p>CUnet, LLC and its affiliated companies ("we" or "us") operate a 
series of websites offering a variety of products and services (a "Site" or the 
"Sites"). This notice outlines the privacy policies of the Sites. By visiting 
this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy 
Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Since any 
changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page 
regularly. Your continued use of the Sites following any changes to this Privacy 
Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes. </p>
<p><strong>Your IP Address</strong></p>
<p>Each time you visit the Sites, our web server automatically recognizes your 
IP address and the Web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help 
identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use 
your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the 
Sites, and to better serve you in using the services and features of the Sites. 
</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Action Tags</strong></p>
<p>The first time a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their 
activities at a Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address 
and deploy a cookie to the user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to a Site 
using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to recall 
the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in 
connection with their activities on a Site (such as name, address, birth date, 
gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the user's e-mail 
address, in our user database. We may use the information stored in our database 
(i) for the purpose for which the information was originally provided by a user, 
(ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to request 
information, sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or offers in 
the future, (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the 
same ads, offers and promotions while visiting Sites, and (iv) to, in connection 
with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or 
advertisements historically, or likely to be, of interest to that user.</p>
<p>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or 
a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to 
track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other 
information on a site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website 
page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags 
to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or 
visit the pages of our Sites and to provide information about what products are 
viewed or purchased. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect From You</strong></p>
<p>While on the Site we may collect personal information from you. Personal 
information may include information you provide to us while registering with a 
Site, making purchases, or as otherwise requested on the Site, such as your 
name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. Personal information may also 
include information we gather about you while on a Site such as your information 
requests &amp; usage history. We may also collect demographic information that 
you provide to us such as your zip code, age, or income level.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We will use your personal information for customer service, to provide you 
with information that you may request, to customize your experience on a Site, 
and to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into 
by you on a Site. We may also use your personal information for internal 
business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also 
combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other 
sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Sites 
or administer activities on our behalf, information requests, interests &amp; 
order fulfillment. We may share your information with these third parties for 
those limited purposes. </p>
<p>In addition, unless a user has elected not to receive our offers and 
third-party offers and promotions or to limit or prohibit disclosure of 
information about them, we may provide individual user information to our 
advertising and marketing partners, our affiliated companies, or other third 
parties interested in marketing to our Sites' users. We make an effort to 
provide users and subscribers with ads and offers that they may find of interest 
and of some value. Nevertheless, it is our policy to allow users to make the 
choices about, and to control, the information our Sites collect and the manner 
in which that information is used. For this reason, users always have the 
ability to update, change or delete information about them collected by the 
Sites, to unsubscribe from any mailing list at any time, to opt out of receiving 
third-party ads, promotions and offers, and to prevent disclosure of their 
information to third-parties for such purposes. We reserve the right to, in 
connection with a transfer of any of our assets to any affiliated company, 
provide user information and data to the affiliate subject to the terms of this 
policy. Similarly, we reserve the right to, in connection with a sale of any of 
our assets or businesses to a third party, sell our customer database, or 
relevant portion thereof, so that a third-party may be able to continue to 
provide the services and features to which our users have subscribed. We may 
release user information if required by law, to enforce any terms of service, or 
to protect the rights, property or safety of our Sites, its registered users, or 
others. Please note that our privacy policy does not apply to websites or web 
pages that link to our Sites.</p>
<p>You may, at any time, notify us that you do not wish to have your personal 
information disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an 
e-mail to privacy@cunetcorp.com&nbsp; 
</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Financial Information</strong></p>
<p>Financial information is used to bill you for products and services. By 
making a purchase on a Site, you consent to our providing your financial 
information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine 
is necessary to process your transactions. These third parties may include the 
credit card companies and banking institutions used to process the 
transaction.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Demographic Information</strong></p>
<p>We use demographic information to tailor Sites to the interests of our users. 
Demographic information is shared with advertisers so that they can tailor their 
advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic information may also be 
shared with other third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>Other sites accessible through our Sites have their own privacy policies and 
data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's 
privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third 
parties. Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other sites on the 
Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices 
of those websites linked to our Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. 
These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit 
personal information. Additionally, other companies that place advertising on 
our Sites may collect information about you when you view or click on their 
advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of 
information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any 
questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
<p>On behalf of various sponsors, we may provide sponsored links to third-party 
websites. If you click on a sponsored link or banner ad, a "window" or "frame" 
containing a third-party's web site may appear in the foreground with a Site in 
the background. Unless you are on one of our Sites, any time that you have moved 
to a window, you should assume that your personal information is being 
collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the windowed site's privacy 
policy (if any). If you are unsure as to whose privacy policy applies, please 
contact us by e-mail at privacy@cunetcorp.com.</p>
<p><strong>Our Security Precautions</strong></p>
<p>The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse 
and alteration of the information under our control. We encrypt all of your 
personal and financial information and use our best efforts to prevent it from 
being read or intercepted as the information travels over the Internet. While we 
are committed to protecting your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the 
security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing Your Information</strong></p>
<p>At your request, we will modify or remove personal information that you have 
provided to us. You may do so by e-mailing privacy@cunetcorp.com. 
However, changing or deleting your information or otherwise opting-out of 
receipt of communications from us or third parties will only change or delete 
the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business on a Site 
and for managing future communications from us and third parties. These changes 
and deletions will not change or delete information already collected as part of 
a particular purchase in our transactions database, which may have already been 
shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy. You 
will need to contact third parties who may contact you directly to change your 
preferences or your personal information that they may be using to contact 
you.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
Compliance</strong></p>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use our Sites. 
Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally 
identifiable information about visitors under 18 years of age. If you are the 
parent or guardian of a minor under 18 years of age and believe that they have 
disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at privacy@cunetcorp.com 
so that we may delete the minor's information.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting us about privacy questions or concerns</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of a Site, 
or your dealings with this Site, please email us at privacy@cunetcorp.com, or by 
sending a letter to:</p>
<p>CUnet, LLC, 445 West Main Street, Wyckoff, NJ, 07481</p>
