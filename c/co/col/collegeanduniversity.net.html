		<h1>CUnet, LLC Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Cunet, LLC (the "Company") wants you to understand how we collect, protect, and use your personally identifiable information ("your information") and the choices you have about how your information is used. This policy covers the information handling practices of the Company; however, certain departments and/or products within the Company may have more restrictive information handling practices.</p>
<h3>Online information</h3>
<p>We are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience. When you access a Company Web site ("Company Site"), you can be sure that your information is protected by physical, procedural, and electronic safeguards. We collect information from your visit only in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us.</p>
<p>To access information and send e-mail via Company Sites, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer. This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet.</p>
<p>When you enter a Company Site, we will identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device. The IP address doesn't identify you personally, but it lets us identify the device you're using. We store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.</p>
<p>Company Sites may use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive (not on the Company Site) by a Web page server. Cookies make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of Company Sites may not work properly if you do. Accepting a cookie from a Company Site does not give us access to any of your information.</p>
<p>If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you don't want to receive future messages with each message you receive. If you e-mail a question or comment to us, we will use your e-mail address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your e-mail address, your message and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your e-mail address this way, we won't use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission.</p>
<p>Company Sites don't knowingly collect, maintain, or use information from children under age 13 unless first complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If we find out we have unknowingly collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose Web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where you may shop.</p>
<p>Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Company Site, even though you may have started your visit with us, and even though our pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with us. We don't share your information with them, but information you choose to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value and excellent customer service you expect from us, but we cannot guarantee your satisfaction with these organizations.</p>
<h3>Information we collect and why</h3>

	<li>Information collected from your transactions with us or others, such as account activity.</li>
	<li>In the case of student loans, information from unaffiliated third parties such as credit histories from credit reporting agencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information safeguarding practices</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Information sharing with affiliated companies</h3>

Unless you instruct us otherwise, our affiliates may selectively contact you about products, services, and promotions that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Information sharing with service providers and others outside of our affiliated companies</p>
<p>To the extent required or permitted by law, we may share your information with service providers and unaffiliated third parties for the following reasons:</p>

	<li>To communicate with you about additional products, services, and special offers, using marketing providers to assist us.</li>

	<li>To respond to your opt-in request or other disclosure request.</li>
	<li>In the case of student loans, to report to a credit bureau, guaranty agency, school, or the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
