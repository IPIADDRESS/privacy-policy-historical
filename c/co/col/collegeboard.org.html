Users do not need an online account to view most parts of the website(s); however, to perform certain tasks or to save personalized information, accounts are required.

Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol><li>Students may choose to participate in Student Search Service when registering for a College Board exam.</li><li>As part of taking a College Board exam, students are asked to fill out a Student Data Questionnaire (SDQ).</li><li>Participating, eligible organizations can then search for groups of students who may be a good fit for their communities and programs, but only among those students who opt to participate in Student Search Service.</li><li>The search criteria can include any attribute from the SDQ, except the following: disability, parental education, self-reported parental income, social security number, phone numbers and actual test scores.</li><li>The most searched items are expected high school graduation date, cumulative GPA and intended college major. A full list of SDQ questions is available in College Board test registration materials.</li></ol><p>If you have questions or concerns about Student Search Service or want more information about the program, please call (866) 825-8051.</p>
<p><strong>Pay for College section:</strong> In the Pay for College section in BigFuture, we offer a variety of tools and services which provide access to current information on college costs, scholarships, financial aid applications, and college financing. These include Scholarship Search and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE<sup>®</sup>. We typically collect the following information when these tools are used: first and last name, address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, anticipated graduation date, family information, and social security number (optional).
