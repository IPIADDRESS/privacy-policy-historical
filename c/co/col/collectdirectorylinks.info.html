  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		            <p>Productive Purpose ("<strong>Productive Purpose</strong>") operates this site and   may operate other websites. It is Productive Purpose's policy to respect your   privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our   websites.</p>
		            <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
		            <p>Like most website operators, Productive Purpose collects   non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and   servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language   preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor   request. Productive Purpose's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying   information is to better understand how Productive Purpose's visitors use its   website. From time to time, Productive Purpose may release   non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by   publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
		            <p>Productive Purpose also collects potentially personally-identifying   information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users   and for users leaving comments on this site and blogs/sites. Productive Purpose   only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same   circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying   information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and   email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the   blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
		            <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		            <p>Certain visitors to Productive Purpose's websites choose to interact with   Productive Purpose in ways that require Productive Purpose to gather   personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information   that Productive Purpose gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For   example, we ask visitors who sign up at this site to provide a username   and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Productive Purpose are   asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the   personal and financial information required to process those   transactions. In each case, Productive Purpose collects such information only   insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the   visitor's interaction with Productive Purpose. Productive Purpose does not disclose   personally-identifying information other than as described below. And   visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,   with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain   website-related activities.</p>
		            <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
		            <p>Productive Purpose may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors   to its websites. Productive Purpose may display this information publicly or   provide it to others. However, Productive Purpose does not disclose   personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
		            <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		            <p>Productive Purpose discloses potentially personally-identifying and   personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,   contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that   information in order to process it on Productive Purpose's behalf or to provide   services available at Productive Purpose's websites, and (ii) that have agreed   not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and   affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by   using Productive Purpose's websites, you consent to the transfer of such   information to them. Productive Purpose will not rent or sell potentially   personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.   Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,   as described above, Productive Purpose discloses potentially   personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in   response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or   when Productive Purpose believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably   necessary to protect the property or rights of Productive Purpose, third parties   or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Productive Purpose   website and have supplied your email address, Productive Purpose may occasionally   send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your   feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with   Productive Purpose and our products. If you send us a request (for example via   email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to   publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to   help us support other users. Productive Purpose takes all measures reasonably   necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or   destruction of potentially personally-identifying and   personally-identifying information.</p>
		            <h3>Cookies</h3>
		            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a   visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the   website each time the visitor returns. Productive Purpose uses cookies to help   Productive Purpose identify and track visitors, their usage of Productive Purpose website,   and their website access preferences. Productive Purpose visitors who do not   wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers   to refuse cookies before using Productive Purpose's websites, with the drawback   that certain features of Productive Purpose's websites may not function properly   without the aid of cookies.</p>
		            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
		            <p>If Productive Purpose, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired,   or in the unlikely event that Productive Purpose goes out of business or enters   bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is   transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such   transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Productive Purpose may continue to   use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
		            <h3>Ads</h3>
		            <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by   advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad   server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online   advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your   computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,   deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most   interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by   Productive Purpose and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
		            <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
		            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Productive Purpose may   change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Productive Purpose's sole   discretion. Productive Purpose encourages visitors to frequently check this page   for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a site account, you   might also receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your   continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will   constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
