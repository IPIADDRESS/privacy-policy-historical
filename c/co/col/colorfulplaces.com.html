<strong>C. Information we collect using  technology</strong>
<br>
We use technology to collect information in order to make your experience at our web sites more enjoyable, and so that we can provide you with enhanced products and services. For example, we may automatically track  and collect your IP address, domain server, the type of web browser and computer  operating system you are using, and we may use web beacons and cookies to: (i)  understand the frequency with which you visit our web sites, (ii) track and  understand the manner in which you are using our web sites, (iii) customize  content to enhance your visit and the services we provide on our web sites, (iv)  offer you targeted messages, advertisements and offers; (v) send you targeted  emails if you have provided us with your email address, and (vi) if you have  registered for Bluegreen Online Services, to tailor your personal preferences.
<br><br>
Cookies are bits of data that a web site sends to your computer’s web browser and operating system. They are stored on your computer hard drive to identify you or your preferences when you return to that web site. For example, by storing cookies on your hard drive, you'll return to a specific web site with the same settings you used on a previous visit. There are two types of cookies.  Temporary cookies are designed to stay on your computer only while you are visiting our web sites. Non-expiring cookies are placed on the hard drive in your computer and allow us to collect information such as: date and time of visits, time spent on the web site, and pages viewed while on the web site. We may place both temporary and non-expiring cookies on your computer. Cookies can also store personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, home or work address or telephone number. You can choose whether to accept or deny cookies by changing the privacy settings on your web browser. In fact, your web browser’s privacy settings can be configured to specify how you want the web browser to handle cookies from individual web sites or all web sites. Please keep in mind that most computers are initially configured to accept cookies.  Also note that if you turn cookies off, some of our services may not function properly.
<br><br>
The pages of our web sites contain images (called a “single-pixel gif" or "web beacons") that allow our third party secure provider and us to count page views or to collect other anonymous data. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act  as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small; usually 1 by 1 pixel in size, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Web beacons are small in order to minimize both their display and their loading time. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our web site visitors; they are merely the technique we use to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about the usage of our web sites.
<br>
For tracking purposes, we use web beacons on our web sites along with other technical methods. We may also use these technical methods in emails that we send to track whether the emails have been opened or if links contained therein have been clicked. We also employ a third party service that collects data remotely through the use of web beacons. This service then returns the completely anonymous data to us as site traffic reports.<br>
<div><a href="#top">Back to  top</a></div><br>
<strong>D. Information we collect from third  parties</strong>
<br>
We may supplement, improve and/or enhance personally identifiable information that we collect from you with other information that we obtain from third parties and our affiliates. In addition, we may obtain information about individuals who are not yet our customers or users of our web sites. Moreover, when we associate information that we obtain from third parties  or affiliates with personally identifiable information that we have collected  under this Privacy Statement, we will treat the acquired information the same as  the information that we collected ourselves, and, except as permitted by this  Privacy Statement, we will not share the information with third parties.<br>
<div><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div><br>
<h3><a name="3"></a>3. How we secure your information</h3><br>
Bluegreen uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. For example, when you enter a password to access a Bluegreen Online Services Account, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to present secure pages to protect that information.  SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that's transferred over the SSL connection. Most web browsers, including Internet Explorer, support SSL and many web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with https instead of http. You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your web browser window. For example, in Internet Explorer you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you're using. Be sure to download and use the latest version of a web browser. Beta versions of web browsers are not recommended.
<br>
In addition  we use a third party payment gateway service that enables us to authorize,  settle and manage credit cards safely and securely via a 128-bit Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) Internet Protocol (IP) connection.<br>

Occasionally, we may partner with other companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, products and services and may share your information with our co-sponsor. For example, we  may co-sponsor a sweepstakes on our site with other companies, or we may provide  prizes for sweepstakes sponsored by other companies. If you enter one of these sweepstakes, we may share your information with the co-sponsor or third party sponsor. All of these third party service providers have contractual obligations with us to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Additionally, these third party service providers are only permitted to use your information for the purposes specified by the sweepstakes or promotion as specified by us or our affiliates, or as allowed by law.

<h3>5. Requesting to not have your personal information shared with non-affiliated third parties</h3>

If you elect this opt-out choice, we will not disclose your information to those non-affiliated third parties set forth in paragraph 4.C., however, we may still  disclose your personal information to third parties: (i) that perform marketing  services on our behalf; and (ii) as permitted by law, such as to service  providers, to protect against fraud, and to protect the security or  confidentiality of our records.
