<h4>UPDATED August 15th 2011</h4>
<p>Appdillo, Inc. (“Appdillo”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of coderwall.com (this “Site”).</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Coderwall collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Coderwall’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Coderwall’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Coderwall may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Coderwall also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Coderwall only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Coderwall’s websites choose to interact with Coderwall in ways that require Coderwall to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Coderwall gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a wall at coderwall.com to provide a username, email address, location and links to their GitHub, Twitter, and StackOverflow accounts. In each case, Coderwall collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Coderwall. Coderwall does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Coderwall discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Coderwall’s behalf or to provide services available at Coderwall’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Coderwall’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Coderwall will not share with or sell your potentially personally-identifying information to other organizations for commercial purposes, except when we have your permission to provide you products or services that you’ve requested. If you are a registered user of a Coderwall website and have supplied your email address, Coderwall may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Coderwall and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Coderwall takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Coderwall uses cookies to help Coderwall identify and track visitors, their usage of Coderwall website, and their website access preferences. Coderwall visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Coderwall’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Coderwall’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Appdillo, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Appdillo goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Appdillo may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
