<b>Privacy Policy</b>

<br><br>Your privacy is important to COBY. This statement discloses the information practices for COBY's Websites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

<br><br><b>Personal Information</b>

<br><br>COBY will only collect personally identifiable information (such as name, title, company name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) that you voluntarily provide through our website or e-mail correspondence. We will collect general information (such as the type of browser you use, the files you request, the domain name and the country from which you request information) to improve our Website and better meet your needs.

<br><br>You may give us a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at COBY that you wish to be considered for. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have his or her permission to do so.

<br><br><b>Other Information</b>

<br><br>The COBY Website may contain links to other sites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites. Additionally, some of our Web pages may contain "cookies," which are data that may be sent to your Web browser and stored on your computer. This allows our server to "recognize" you when you visit our Website in the future. Most Web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. 

<br><br>It may be necessary, if required by law or if pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations, to release your personally identifiable information. 


<br><br><b>Human Resource Related Information</b>

<br><br>In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on a COBY Website or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout COBY and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.

<br><br><b>Business Partners Information</b>

<br><br>If you represent a COBY Business Partner, you may visit a COBY Website intended specifically for COBY Business Partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Business Partner you represent, and COBY Business Partners generally. For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of COBY Business Partner programs. It may also include sharing certain information with other Business Partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or COBY customers or prospects. From time to time we may supplement information you give us via a COBY Website with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.

<br><br>COBY reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. We will promptly reflect any such modifications in these Web pages.
