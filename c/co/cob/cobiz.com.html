                           to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to 
                           accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will 
                           expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access

                         <br>  <br>
                           You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block 
                           cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you 
                           will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.
