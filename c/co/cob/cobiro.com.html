                    <li>To provide you with the advertising services you have ordered, we need information
about you. If you use Cobiro services, you are in control of what information we collect
about you, but if you choose not to share your information, you may not be able to access
or use some of our services.</li>
					<li>We will collect information about you when you use our services; advertise with us; set
up, look at, or change your profile or account with us; ask for information from us or give
us a testimonial or other feedback.</li>
					<li>The information we collect and hold about you may include your name (first and last
name); business name; job title; business address; product data, phone and/or mobile
phone numbers; email address; bank account, debit card and/or credit card details; date

questions (for example your mother’s maiden name) or both; and any other information
you may give us when you write to us or contact us in other ways.</li>
					<li>When you register for Cobiro services we collect your email address and mobile number.
We may use it for account administration and for added security. We may use your email
address or text via your mobile number to send you a confirmation of any order or
booking you make, if you ask for our products or services and to confirm any profile or
account changes you make. We might also use your email address or text via mobile
number to bring you news such as changes to the way you can use Cobiro services or
any of our other new services and special offers we think you might be interested in.</li>
					<li>Once you connect to the Cobiro platform your Google AdWords account a copy of
campaigns and keywords and their performance will be temporarily downloaded to our
platform. We might also temporarily download other data including product data and
place a script on your website to measure conversions. By temporarily we mean that we
1) download the data, 2) process it, 3) upload necessary changes to Google AdWords,
and 4) delete the data from our servers again.</li>
                  </ol>


				<li><b>How we will use information we collect about you</b></li>

information about the use of your website or other online advertising with that of our other
customers. We will remove all personally identifying information before aggregating this
data.</li>
					<li>We may use the information you give us about yourself when you register for Cobiro

make sure that when you visit our websites, you don’t miss offers and information that

information you have asked for. We keep the information you provide and may use it for
several purposes, including, accounting, billing and audit; credit checking or screening;
credit, debit or other payment card verification and screening; debt collection; safety,

information; developing, testing and maintaining systems; studies, research and
development; advertiser or user surveys; and customer services and to help us in any
future dealings with you, for example by identifying your requirements and preferences.</li>

publish it online or offline to promote our business, products and services. We will ask for
your permission before we publish it.</li>
<li>We may ask you how we are performing or for your opinion on our products and services.
