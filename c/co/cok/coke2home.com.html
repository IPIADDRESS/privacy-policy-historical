<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Private Limited (hereafter “<strong>HCCBPL</strong>”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors (hereafter the "<strong>Visitors</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>" or “<strong>your</strong>”) to our Internet world wide web site <a href="http://www.coke2home.com">http://www.coke2home.com</a> (hereafter the “<strong>Website</strong>”) that links directly to this privacy policy about the protection of personal information online. We aim for the Website to be a safe and enjoyable environment for you.</p>
<p>This privacy policy (hereafter the "<strong>Policy</strong>") primarily describes:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>the information that HCCBPL collects through the Website, which is hosted and operated from India;</li>
<li>the use and role of cookies and similar technologies on the Website; and</li>
<li>the security measures HCCBPL has in place to protect the information that HCCBPL gathers through the Website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Policy does not govern HCCBPL’s collection of information through any website, or by any other means, other than through this Website, or the collection of information by any parent, or subsidiaries of HCCBPL ("<strong>Other Entities</strong>").</p>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to read this Policy before using the Website. By using the Website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website, available at <a href="?pi=123456">www.coke2home.com/terms</a>. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website, please do not use the Website.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Information Gathered by HCCBPL Through the Website.</p>
<p>HCCBPL gathers two basic types of information through the Website: (i) "Personal Information," information from which an individual can be identified, and (ii) "Aggregate Information," from which an individual cannot be identified.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Personal Information. You are not ordinarily required to register or provide Personal Information in order to access the Website, though in case you wish to create your account on the Website or participate in any other membership program or contest or promotion, through which you may receive discounts on online purchases, participate in any contests, etc.. HCCBPL collects Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it to HCCBPL - for example, purchasing HCCBPL products online, in contacting HCCBPL through the Website, or exploring business opportunities with HCCBPL, answering surveys and polls, entering contests and similar promotions and signing up for email updates and announcements concerning HCCBPL’s products and special promotions. Personal Information may include your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers and/or email address). Your payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date ("<strong>Payment Information</strong>"), will be collected by the respective banks and/or third party payment gateway, if you wish to purchase any product or merchandise made available through the Website ("<strong>Transaction</strong>").</li>
<li>Aggregate Information. When you visit the Website, HCCBPL and the third parties with whom HCCBPL has contracted to provide services, may collect anonymous information from three sources: server log files, cookies, and pixel tags.
<ul>
<li>Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in HCCBPLs server log files whenever you visit the Website, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses of all Visitors are used by HCCBPL to calculate the Website usage levels, to help diagnose problems with the Websites servers, and to administer the Website. HCCBPL may also use IP addresses to communicate or to block access by Visitors who fail to comply with the Policy and/or the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website. Collecting IP addresses is a standard practice followed on the Internet and is carried out automatically by many websites.</li>
<li>Cookies. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites, and help facilitate users ongoing access to and use of a particular website. Cookies do not cause damage to the computer system or files, and only the website that transfers a particular cookie to the computer system can read, modify or delete such cookie. If you do not want your information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure to be followed, in most of the browsers, by the user that allows the user to delete existing cookies, automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to the user’s computer system. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to access certain portions of the Website.</li>
<li>Pixel Tags. The Website may use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>") to compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates. Pixel Tags enables HCCBPL to maintain a count of the users who have visited certain pages of the Website. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and as to when the email was opened and read by the receiver of the e-mail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Use and Disclosure of Information Gathered By HCCBPL through the Website.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Personal Information. HCCBPL may use Visitors Personal Information in any of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Communications. HCCBPL encourages the Visitors to contact HCCBPL with questions and comments. Personal Information may be used by HCCBPL in order to respond to the respective Visitors questions and comments.</li>
<li>Business Purposes. HCCBPL may also use the Personal Information of its Visitors for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing its businesses. The Personal Information collected from the Website may be combined with other information collected by HCCBPL via other online or offline sources, with demographic information and other information that is available in the public domain.</li>
<li>Transactions. When you take part in a Transaction through the Website such as purchasing HCCBPLs products or merchandise, HCCBPL may collect Payment Information from you related to such Transaction as well as other Personal Information such as shipping address for shipping of the ordered products or merchandise purchased through the Website. HCCBPL may use your Personal Information or Payment Information in order to complete the Transaction and, if applicable, to fulfill your purchase. The Payment Information may also be shared with the third parties, as may be necessary, to complete your Transaction (for example, to process the payment made through the credit card).</li>
<li>Contests, Competitions and Other Promotions. HCCBPL may, from time to time, introduce and organize any contests, competitions and similar promotions through its Website that may require online registration by the Visitor for participating in such contest, competition or promotion (which may include name, email, user ID and password). HCCBPL may ask you for certain Personal Information during the process of registration for participating in such contest, competition or promotional schemes. HCCBPL may share this Personal Information with third party sponsors of such contests, competitions and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by HCCBPL), in accordance with the rules applicable to such contest, competition or promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each contest, competition and promotion in which you participate through the Website, as they may contain certain additional important information about HCCBPL or the sponsors use of your Personal Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your Personal Information enlarge the scope of use of such information in terms of this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall also apply.</li>
<li>Special Promotions and Product Information. In addition, HCCBPL reserves the right to use your Personal Information for sending you the e-mails of updates and announcements concerning HCCBPLs products and special promotions. You may opt-out of receiving these messages from HCCBPL at any time (see Section 5 “<strong>Choice</strong>” below).</li>
<li>Critical Communications. HCCBPL may from time to time and as may be necessary use your Personal Information to send emails consisting of important information regarding the Website, your Transactions, or for notifying any amendments or modifications to the terms, conditions, and/or policies of HCCBPL with respect to use of this Website ("<strong>Critical Emails</strong>"). Since Critical Emails would consist of important information you shall not have the option of not receiving Critical Emails.</li>
<li>Third Party Service Providers. HCCBPL works with third parties who provide services, including website hosting, credit card processing, data analysis, newsletter services, promotional activities, and other administrative services. HCCBPL may share your Personal Information, including your Payment Information, with such third parties, as may be necessary, for the purpose of enabling such third parties discharge the provision of such services.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous. HCCBPL may disclose your Personal Information if HCCBPL believes that it is required to do so: (i) by law; (ii) to comply with legal process or governmental requests; (iii) to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use; (iv) to protect our operations; (v) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of HCCBPL, you or others; and (vi) to enable itself to pursue the available remedies or limit the damages that it may sustain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aggregate Information. HCCBPL may analyze Aggregate Information in order to enhance the Website security, track the popularity of certain pages of the Website, track success of our email notifications, assess traffic levels on the Website and other usage data, all of which would help HCCBPL to provide content tailored to the interests of the consumers, improve the Website and related services and to otherwise enhance Visitors experience on the Website. HCCBPL may also share the Aggregate Information with its Other Entities and other third parties for provision of such services.</li>
