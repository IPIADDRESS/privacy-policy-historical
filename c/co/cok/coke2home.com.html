<h1>Privacy</h1><br><br>
<div class="margin-left" style="margin-top:20px;"><p>Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Private Limited (hereafter <strong>“HCCBPL”</strong>) is committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors (hereafter the <strong>"Visitors,</strong> <strong>"you"</strong> or <strong>“your”</strong>) to our Internet world wide web site <a title="home" href="http://www.coke2home.com">http://www.coke2home.com</a> (hereafter the <strong>“Website”</strong>) that links directly to this privacy policy about the protection of personal information online. We aim for the Website to be a safe and enjoyable environment for you.</p>
<p>This privacy policy (hereafter the <strong>"Policy"</strong>) primarily describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information that HCCBPL collects through the Website, which is hosted and operated from India;</li>
<li>the use and role of cookies and similar technologies on the Website; and</li>
<li>the security measures HCCBPL has in place to protect the information that HCCBPL gathers through the Website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Policy does not govern HCCBPL’s collection of information through any website, or by any other means, other than through this Website, or the collection of information by any parent, or subsidiaries of HCCBPL (<strong>"Other Entities"</strong>).</p>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to read this Policy before using the Website. By using the Website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website, available at <a title="terms" href="http://www.coke2home.com/Terms.htm">www.coke2home.com/terms</a>. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website, please do not use the Website.</p>
<p>1. Information Gathered by HCCBPL Through the Website.</p>
<p>HCCBPL gathers two basic types of information through the Website: (i) "Personal Information," information from which an individual can be identified, and (ii) "Aggregate Information," from which an individual cannot be identified.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Personal Information. You are not ordinarily required to register or provide Personal Information in order to access the Website, though in case you wish to create your account on the Website or participate in any other membership program or contest or promotion, through which you may receive discounts on online purchases, participate in any contests, etc.. HCCBPL collects Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it to HCCBPL - for example, purchasing HCCBPL products online, in contacting HCCBPL through the Website, or exploring business opportunities with HCCBPL, answering surveys and polls, entering contests and similar promotions and signing up for email updates and announcements concerning HCCBPL’s products and special sales and promotions. Personal Information may include your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers and/or email address). Your payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date (<strong>"Payment Information"</strong>), will be collected by the respective banks and/or third party payment gateway, if you wish to purchase any product or merchandise made available through the Website (<strong>"Transaction"</strong>).</li>
<li>Aggregate Information. When you visit the Website, HCCBPL and the third parties with whom HCCBPL has contracted to provide services, may collect anonymous information from three sources: server log files, cookies, and pixel tags.
<ul>
<li>Server Log Files. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in HCCBPLs server log files whenever you visit the Website, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses of all Visitors are used by HCCBPL to calculate the Website usage levels, to help diagnose problems with the Websites servers, and to administer the Website. HCCBPL may also use IP addresses to communicate or to block access by Visitors who fail to comply with the Policy and/or the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website. Collecting IP addresses is a standard practice followed on the Internet and is carried out automatically by many websites.</li>
<li>Cookies. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites, and help facilitate users ongoing access to and use of a particular website. Cookies do not cause damage to the computer system or files, and only the website that transfers a particular cookie to the computer system can read, modify or delete such cookie. If you do not want your information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure to be followed, in most of the browsers, by the user that allows the user to delete existing cookies, automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to the user’s computer system. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to access certain portions of the Website.</li>
<li>Pixel Tags. The Website may use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, <strong>"Pixel Tags"</strong>) to compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates. Pixel Tags enables HCCBPL to maintain a count of the users who have visited certain pages of the Website. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and as to when the email was opened and read by the receiver of the e-mail.</li>
