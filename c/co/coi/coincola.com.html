    <h1>CoinCola Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h4><strong>Version 1.0, last updated: September 4, 2018</strong></h4>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Welcome to CoinCola. The Privacy Policy stipulates the types of information of yours that
        we may collect through your log into this Website, your registration with this Website, and/or use the services we
        offer, as well as how we shall use and protect the information so collected. This section will assist you in understanding
        how we collect, use, store, disclose and protect personal information. </span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">To protect your rights, please read the following thoroughly and contact us with any questions
        regarding our Privacy Policy. </span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Your consent</strong></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your consent to CoinCola’s processing and protecting your personal information according
        to the Privacy Policy is implied upon your use of the services of this website. </span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">(a) You agree that CoinCola may process personal information provided by you and hereby
        consent to the transmittal of your personal data outside the European Economic Area. </span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">(b) You hereby acknowledge and agree that CoinCola shall process personal information
        provided by you the purpose of performing our obligations under this Privacy Policy and for the purpose of administering
        the relationship between you and us. We may share your personal information with third parties in order to provide
        you with our services and improve our product and services in line with the applicable laws and our Privacy Policy.
        CoinCola will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your prior consent and/or without
        having a legal basis to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">(c) You agree that CoinCola may pass information about you which you have provided to
        CoinCola to other companies in CoinCola’s group and to external companies to help CoinCola to process and/or
        analyse it as part of the provision of services to you.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">(d) In the event that you consented for the use of personal data by CoinCola for marketing
        and information management purposes, or to conduct market research for CoinCola then CoinCola may share these data
        with other companies in its group or with carefully selected external parties that may use the personal data to bring
        to the attention of the Client products and services that may be of interest to the Client and also to assist in
        the efficient provision of services.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Your rights </strong></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a right to:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <ul class="ol1">
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(a) <strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a “data
          subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to
          check that we are lawfully processing it. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies
          may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can ask for your personal data by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@coincola.com"><span class="s2">privacy@coincola.com</span></a>.&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(b) <strong>Request correction of the personal data</strong> that we hold about you. This
          enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you completed or corrected, though we may need
          to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(c) <strong>Request erasure of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to ask us
          to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
          the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to
          object to processing where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase
          your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
          request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
          request.</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(d) <strong>Object to processing of your personal data</strong> where we are relying on
          a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which
          makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
          You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In
          some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides
          your rights and freedoms.</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(e) <strong>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</strong> This enables
          you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to
          establish the data’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase
          it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
          or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
          overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(f) <strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party</strong>.
          We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
          format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us
          to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span></li>
      <li class="li2"><span class="s1">(g) <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process
          your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
          your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
          We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. </span></li>

    <p class="p4"><span class="s1">Such as IP addresses, cookies for user device authentication and other similar device

        systems for a variety of reasons including fraud protection, and certain financial regulations in various jurisdictions.
        This information also helps keep your account secure, so we can keep a track of where your account has been accessed
        from. Logging your IP address also allows CoinCola to offer you the best experience possible by determining your
        location for offer matching.</span></p>

        account notifications, and other related account activities. This information is collected to provide you with improved

        easier. We also store this data in order to analyse transactions that may be in a dispute or other inquiry.</span></p>

    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">All the aforementioned general categories of data may contain data that by itself does
        not identify you and is therefore not deemed as personal data.</span></p>

    <p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>How Long We Hold This Data</strong></span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">CoinCola holds your account data indefinitely. This is because all account data is associated

        data or shares this data. All data is stored in encrypted servers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>When
        you close your account, we stop sharing your data with 3rd parties immediately. All data is stored in encrypted servers.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="p4"><span class="s1">Third Party cookies are set by other websites who place cookies on the user’s computer.
        The "3rd party" cookies are placed when you are logged into their service and CoinCola does not control the dissemination
