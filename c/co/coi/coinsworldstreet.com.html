							This Privacy Policy, as amended or otherwise changed from time to time (the “Privacy Policy”), explains the manner in which Cryptocoinstreet Ltd (“Cryptocoinstreet”) collects, uses, maintains and discloses user information obtained through the Cryptocoinstreet.com website (the “Site”). The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Cryptocoinstreet Ltd By using the Site, you (“User”) consent to the data practices prescribed in this Privacy Policy. On occasion, Cryptocoinstreet may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in law, our personal data collection and use practices, the features on the Site, or advances in technology. If material changes are made to this Privacy Policy, the changes will be prominently posted on the Site. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.
<br><br>
Please note: This Privacy Policy does not cover any information that we may receive about you through channels external to Cryptocoinstreet.<br>
<br>
What information does Cryptocoinstreet collect?<br>
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.<br>
<br>
“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.<br>
We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, date of birth, government issued identification, photographs, biometric information (including but not limited to device fingerprinting), company name, and password when you use our Site.<br>
We may also collect other Personal Data provided by third party identity verification services or via social networking websites.
 <br><br>
If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device or computer to send us your location), we may store that information.<br>
Certain services, such as two-factor authentication, may require our collection of your phone number. We may associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.
<br><br>
If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
<br><br>
We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily when seeking support services, such as email, information submitted via online form, video conferencing service information, other contact information, or other information provided to support services staff.<br>
We may collect other data, including but not limited to, referral URLs, your location, blockchain analytics information related to blockchain addresses you provide.
<br><br>
Some information is collected automatically by our servers:<br>
Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
 <br><br>
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.
We retain information on your behalf, such as transactional data and other session data linked to your Account.
 <br><br>
How does Cryptocoinstreet use the information it collects?<br>
In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your Personal Data in the following ways:
 <br><br>

identify you and perform identity verification through a service provider;
provide improved administration of our Site and Services;
improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Site and Services;
send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was created;
send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as account activity, transaction processing, security or support and maintenance advisories;
identify, prevent, and report potentially suspicious, fraudulent, or illegal activities;
notify you about important changes to our Terms; and respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests.
 <br>
All data collected automatically will be used to administer or improve our services.<br>
We use IP address to make our Site and Services more useful to you, and to perform identity verification.<br>
We use information from log files to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.

This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation. We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data and aggregated and other de-identified information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.

In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
