	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

	<p>This Privacy Policy describes your privacy rights regarding our collection, use, storage, sharing and protection of
	your personal information. We take your privacy and the privacy of our publishers very seriously.
	Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how CoinTent Inc. (“CoinTent,” “we,”
	our,” or “us”) treats information, including personally identifiable information when you
	visit our website located at https://cointent.com (this “Site”) or a publisher site that is selling
	content using CoinTent’s services. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right
	to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances
	under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or
	concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:support@cointent.com">support@cointent.com</a>.</p>

	<h3>What This Policy Covers</h3>

	<p>This policy covers the ways in which CoinTent treats information, including personally
	identifiable information, which we obtain when you use the CoinTent. We regard personally
	identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in
	person, such as your real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical
	mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a user in our system
	is not considered personally identifiable information. This policy does not cover privacy
	practices of third parties, such as the Publishers we work with, or third-party payment
	process services.</p>

	<h3>How We Collect Information</h3>

	<p></p><h5>Information Provided By CoinTent consumers.</h5> Content consumers must create
	an account with CoinTent to access content through our services. To create an account we
	will require your email address and will send you an email to that address to confirm you
	are the owner of that email address. If you choose to fund your account you will need to
	provide payment information. If you fund your account with a credit card, CoinTent may
	collect your credit card number; expiration date; name on the credit card; card security
	code, zip/postal code; and physical address.<p></p>

	<h3>Editing / Deleting Account Information.</h3>

	<p></p><h5>Account access:</h5> Any user who creates a CoinTent account can view the personally
	identifiable information we have collected from that user by logging in on our website and
	viewing their account page. To completely delete your account and accompanying personal
	information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cointent.com">support@cointent.com</a>.<p></p>

	<h3>Information We Do Not Collect From Any Users</h3>

	<p></p><h5>Children.</h5>&nbsp;As explained further in our Consumer Terms of Service and Publisher Terms
	of Service, you must be 18 years of age or older – or, if you are under the age of majority
	in your jurisdiction, have the consent of your parent or guardian – to use the CoinTent
	Service. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about
	children. In accordance with Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
	(COPPA), CoinTent will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable
	information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age. If you believe that we
	have information from or about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us by email at
	<a href="mailto:support@cointent.com">support@cointent.com</a>.<p></p>

	<p></p><h5>Social Security Number.</h5>&nbsp;We do not require your social security number to use the
	CoinTent Service or to access any part of our site. CoinTent will never ask for your social
	security number except in the course of required tax documentation prior to publisher
	payments.<p></p>

	<h3>Information We Track</h3>

	<p></p><h5>Log Files.</h5>&nbsp;Similar to many websites and internet services, we gather certain anonymous,
	non-personal information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information
	includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site
	entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this
	information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, and gather aggregate
	information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about
	a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been
	removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information. Of course,
	if you complete transactions through the CoinTent site, we will collect and track payment
	information so that we can properly pay our publisher partners.<p></p>

	<p></p><h5>Cookies.</h5>&nbsp;A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-
	keeping purposes. It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, what
	pages they view during their visit, and their account and preference information as users of
	the CoinTent Service. Similar to many websites, the CoinTent Service stores an encrypted
	cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back without requiring
	you to log in each time. Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our
	users to enhance the overall experience on our site. Cookies used by CoinTent do not
	include your personally identifiable information<p></p>

	<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your web browser software to disable them.
	To do so, please refer to the help section of your specific browser for more information on
	how to manage or disable cookies. Please note that your browser must be configured to
	accept cookies to use the CoinTent Service.</p>

	<h3>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h3>

	<p></p><h5>Information Use:</h5> Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth,
	efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:<p></p>

	<ul>
		<li>provide CoinTent Services and customer support;</li>
		<li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions;</li>
		<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
		<li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Terms;</li>
		<li>customize, measure, and improve CoinTent Services and the content, layout, and operation of our websites and applications;</li>
		<li>deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</h3>

	<p></p><h5>With Third-Parties.</h5> We share your personally identifiable information, i.e. user name
	and email address, with Publishers that use the CoinTent Service to make their content
	available to Consumers. We do so because when a Consumer purchases content from one
	of our Publisher partners they are in effect acting as a customer of the Publisher. Your data
	is co-owned with the Publisher and CoinTent.<p></p>

	<p>Occasionally we share anonymous, non-personal, aggregate information about our user
	base with partners or advertisers, and we may publish these aggregate usage statistics on
	our website for the interest of our users. We do not tie this shared or published data to the
	personally identifiable information of any person.</p>

	<p></p><h5>As Necessary In Certain Legal Circumstances.</h5>&nbsp;We reserve the right to disclose
	your information, including personally identifiable information, when we have a good faith
	belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is necessary to (a)
	comply with any law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b)
	enforce this Privacy Policy, including investigation of potential violations of this Privacy
	Policy, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d)
	protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of CoinTent, its users, or the public as
	required or permitted by law.<p></p>

	<p></p><h5>Acquisition.</h5>&nbsp;If CoinTent becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale
	of some or all of its assets, including bankruptcy, our assets, including user information,
	may be transferred to a third party. At that time, your user information may become subject
	to that third party’s privacy policy. Before we transfer your user information, we will notify
	you either by email or by posting a prominent notice on our site, and we will remind you of
	your ability to add, edit or delete your personally identifiable information from your account
	management options page in advance of any such transfer.<p></p>

	<h3>HOW WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE</h3>

	<p></p><h5>Network Security.</h5>&nbsp;We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard and secure
	your personal information while stored on our computer systems. We have implemented a
	variety of industry standard encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect
	your information, including your personal information, stored in our computer systems from
	unauthorized access. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet,
	or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, thus we strive to use commercially
	reasonable means to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its
	absolute security.<p></p>

	<p></p><h5>Management Procedures.</h5>&nbsp;We also maintain industry standard physical and electronic
	procedural safeguards that limit access to your personally identifiable information to
	our employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements)
	who, through the course of standard business activities, need to access your personally
	identifiable information.<p></p>

	<h3>UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

	<p>We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be
	effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide notice
	of the changes prominently on this page of our website.</p>

	<h3>How you can contact us about privacy questions</h3>

	<p>If you have questions or concerns with this policy please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cointent.com">support@cointent.com</a>.</p>
