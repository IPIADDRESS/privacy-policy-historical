At CoinSpot, we are committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This Privacy Policy
describes our current policies and practices in relation to the collection, handling, use and disclosure of
personal information. It also deals with how you can complain about a breach of the privacy laws, how you can
access the personal information we hold about you and how to have that information corrected.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What information do we collect and how do we use it?</h4>
When you use the CoinSpot Platform, we ask you for the information we need to verify your identity and support such services
provided on CoinSpot in order to facilitate the provision of buying, selling and trading digital currency.
This can include a broad range of information ranging from your name, address, contact details, IP address,
device information, operating system, web log information, passport number, driver licence number, bank account
numbers, and digital currency account information. We may provide the information that you provide to identity
verification services, credit bureaus or to our customer support team to enable them to verify your identity
under Anti-Money Laundering policies and to protect you and other users of our Platform from fraud and other
illegal activities. We may also provide your personal information if requested by a law enforcement or government
agency. We also use your information to enable us to manage your ongoing requirements and our relationship
with you, e.g.to process transactions, email you a notice or receipt of your transaction, troubleshoot a problem,
send promotional offer, prevent or investigate illegal or potentially illegal activities, and to customise
and improve CoinSpot’s Platform. We may do so by electronically unless you tell us that you do not wish to
receive electronic communications. From time to time we will use your contact details to send you offers, updates,
events, articles, newsletters or other information about products and services that we believe will be of interest
to you. We may also send you regular updates by email. We will always give you the option of electing not to
receive these communications and you can unsubscribe at any time by notifying us that you wish to do so. We
may also use your information internally to help us improve our services and help resolve any problems.
<br><br>
<h4>What if you don’t provide some information to us?</h4>
If you do not provide us with some or all of the information that we ask for, we may not be able to verify your identity
and as such you may not be able to open a trading account with CoinSpot and use our Platform.
<br><br>
<h4>How do we hold and protect your information?</h4>
We strive to maintain the relevance, reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of the personal information we hold
and to protect its privacy and security. We keep personal information only for as long as is reasonably necessary
for the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document
retention requirements We hold the information we collect from you in highly secure data centres operated by
a third party. The datacentres used have ISO 270014, 270175 and 270186 certifications and PCI DSS7 compliance.
This has been independently audited by third parties. ISO 27018 certification has also been achieved for our
data centre partners, which demonstrates a system of controls in place that specifically address the privacy
protection of customer content. We ensure that your information is safe by managing access controls, such as
identity, access management, permissions and security credentials. Access to personal information is only granted
to an employee of CoinSpot to carry out duties required to support our customers. Strong, multi-factor authentication
is used and access is revoked when no longer required.
<br><br>
<h4>Will we disclose the information we collect to anyone?</h4>
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may disclose your information to law enforcement agencies
in Australia if requested as part of an investigation. We may disclose some of your personal information to
third party suppliers and service providers (e.g. an email sending service such as MailChimp), third party
identity verification services, or to other companies in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganisation,
dissolution or similar event. However, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that they protect your information
in the same way that we do. We may provide your information to others if we are required to do so by law or
under some unusual other circumstances which the Privacy Act permits.
<br><br>
<h4>How can you check, update or change the information we are holding?</h4>
Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to allow us to identify the information, we will disclose to
you the personal information we hold about you. We will also correct, amend or delete any personal information
that we agree is inaccurate, irrelevant, out of date or incomplete. We will allow you to correct, amend or
delete certain personal information on our Platform by logging into your CoinSpot account and clicking on the
settings section. In some cases, to ensure security and integrity of the Platform, we may be required to maintain
historical personal information you have submitted to us. You may also seek to access or correct your personal
information by submitting a support request from CoinSpot’s website. We do not charge for receiving a request
for access to personal information or for complying with a correction request. In some limited cases, we may
need to refuse access to your information or refuse a request for correction. We will advise you as soon as
possible after your request if this is the case and the reasons for our refusal.
<br><br>
<h4>What happens if you want to complain?</h4>
If you have any concerns about whether we have complied with the Privacy Act or this Privacy Policy when collecting of handling
your personal information, please submit a support request from CoinSpot’s website or email us at
