We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Coinonx’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the services, websites, and applications offered by Coinonx (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you consent to our use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
<p>Coinonx collects personal information to provide you with a personalized, useful and efficient experience. The categories of information we collect can include:</p>
<p><u>Information You Directly Provide to Us</u></p>
<p>There are many occasions when you provide information that may enable us to identify you personally (“Personally Identifiable Information”) while using the Services, such as when you sign up for an account, verify your identity or your status as an Accredited Investor or Qualified Purchaser, provide account information or provide us with access to your profiles on third party sites such as angel.co. Personally, Identifiable Information we collect may include, without limitation, your email address, name, phone number, birthday, age, address, Social Security number and/or taxpayer identification number, investment objectives, investment experience, and your educational or professional history.</p>
<p>We may use your email address to send you newsletters, updates about the Service, and Services-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You can control receipt of certain Services-related messages on your Coinonx Settings page. We may also use your contact information to send you marketing messages from us or our affiliates. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message. (Please note it may take up to one week to process any opt-out requests.) If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.</p>
<p><u>Information from other sources</u></p>
<p>We may obtain information from other sources, such as our affiliates, our partners who provide a joint service, third-party information providers, or through mergers and acquisitions, and combine this with information previously collected. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of the combined personal information.</p>
<p><u>Information We Collect Automatically through Cookies and Other Tracking Technology</u></p>
<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your usage of the Services, including the pages and articles and presentations you viewed, time spent using certain features of the website, demographic data such as server locations, connection speed, and other information that does not identify you (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” and collectively with the Personally Identifiable Information, the “Data”). Like most online services, we may use cookies, log files, clear GIFs, tracking pixels, web beacons, and other technologies some of which are detailed below.</p>
<p>Cookies:&nbsp;When you visit the Services, we may send one or more “cookies“– small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Services to us but does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p>Log Files:&nbsp;Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record certain information your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p>Clear GIFs Information:&nbsp;When you use the Services, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons or tracking pixels) to anonymously track online usage patterns. No Personally Identifiable Information from your AngelList account is collected using these clear GIFs. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information collected is used to enable more accurate reporting and make Coinonx better for our users.</p>
<p>Location Data:&nbsp;Depending on your device settings, we may also collect your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.</p>
<p>Third Party Services:&nbsp;We may use third party services such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Zoho to help understand use of the Services. Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Zoho collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Zoho also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their respective privacy policies. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we may not respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive for the following: to deliver and improve our Services; to manage your account and provide you with customer support; to perform research and analysis about your use of the Services; to improve and develop our Services; to communicate with you; to develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Services and other sites; to diagnose or fix technology problems; to automatically update the Services on your device; to verify your identify and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; and to perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or is needed to provide you the Services and may retain Data after you discontinue use of the Services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties in the instances described below.</p>
<p>Partners &amp; Affiliates.&nbsp;We share your personal information with our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership and with third party partners with whom we work or who have engaged us to provide the Service to you or to provide a joint service. These partners may use your personal information as permitted in the respective partner’s own privacy policy.</p>
<p>Service Providers.&nbsp;We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Services to you or to help us market our products and services. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside of our direct control (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be shared subject to the terms of use governing our API. We cannot ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information will be protected, controlled or otherwise managed pursuant to this Privacy Policy if you share your login and password information with any third party, including any third party operating a website or providing other services.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Coinonx does not verify information provided by token/ico developers and other users on this platform and makes no assurance as to the completeness or accuracy of any such information. All users, buyers and participants must conduct their own due diligence of each network or proposed network, as well as the risk associated with distributed network tokens as a new asset class. Token/ico developers may possess material information not known to investors or the public about the network, its implementation and its tokens/coins. All activities on this site are governed by our terms of service. Coinonx employees, officers, directors and affiliates may own equity, tokens/coins or other interests in companies offering tokens/coins or other securities on the coinonx site. They may also participate in the current offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The purchase of network tokens and cryptocurrency are particularly risky and may result in total loss of capital. Roadmap proposed for a network (i.e., “white paper”) is subject to change or implementation failure. An implemented network may not be adopted, resulting in its tokens having low or no value. Past performance of a network or a cryptocurrency is not indicative of similar future patterns. Only sophisticated users who understand the risks of speculative investing in new asset classes may participate on this platform. Investment advisory activities, if any, will be conducted and supervised by coinonx.</span></p>
