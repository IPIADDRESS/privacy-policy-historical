<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">European Union Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</span></strong></p>
<p>CoreLogic, Inc. and its affiliates (“CoreLogic”) respect the privacy of our visitors and clients. It is our policy to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of any personal data voluntarily submitted to us in writing, submitted electronically via our Website, or submitted to us by our clients in connection with credit and fraud risk management and other services.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p>This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to personal information pertaining to an identified or identifiable individual that is received by CoreLogic from the European Union or other personal information that CoreLogic acquires pursuant to its performance of services for its clients or other third parties to which CoreLogic has contractually agreed to apply this privacy policy (“EU Personal Data"). This Policy does not apply to: (a) data collected and used by CoreLogic which is not EU Personal Data; (b) the subsidiaries of CoreLogic, Inc. which do not receive or process EU Personal Data or; (c) data collected on any other subsidiary website that does not link to this Policy.&nbsp;<br>In the event of a conflict between this Policy and CoreLogic’s obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et. seq., other statutes, regulations, or case law, or to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements, adherence to this Policy may be limited.</p>
<p><strong>PROVISIONS OF OUR SAFE HARBOR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>CoreLogic receives certain EU Personal Data at the request of clients and other third parties for credit and fraud risk mitigation related purposes. CoreLogic has joined the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbor" program with respect to EU Personal Data and utilizes such information in accordance with the Safe Harbor principles. The Safe Harbor principles and our Safe Harbor certification can be found at: <a title="www.export.gov/safeharbor" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. Our Policy addresses each of the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as described below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Notice</strong></p>
<p>Where CoreLogic collects EU Personal Data from individuals, CoreLogic informs individuals about the purposes for which it collects and uses EU Personal Data about them, how to contact CoreLogic with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the information and the choices and means CoreLogic offers individuals for limiting its use and disclosure. Notice is provided in clear and conspicuous language either when individuals are first asked to provide EU Personal Data or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but in any event before CoreLogic uses such information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or processed by the transferring organization or discloses it for the first time to a third-party (other than agents acting under our instructions). Information about how CoreLogic collects and uses EU Personal Data also follows below.</p>
<p>CoreLogic gathers and maintains consumer and other data which it provides to entities including lenders, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. Provided below is an illustrative list of common ways in which lenders, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies use the data provided by this service:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Authentication of consumer applicants for loans or other credit services</li>
<li>Prevention or detection of fraud by consumer applicants for loans or other credit services</li>
<li>Determination of credit worthiness or capacity of consumer applicants for loans or other credit services</li>
<li>Location of absconded borrowers</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of this notice covers consumer report data that CoreLogic has obtained on behalf of lenders and other businesses by manually or electronically contacting the appropriate sources of the data (court records, references, licensing bureaus, etc.).<br>More information regarding the nature and scope of consumer data inquiries is available by contacting CoreLogic in writing or by e-mail at the addresses below.</p>
<p><strong>2. Choice</strong></p>
<p>CoreLogic affords individuals the opportunity to choose whether their EU Personal Data will be disclosed to a third-party (not including our agents) or will be used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Therefore, consumer data may be disseminated under these circumstances unless the consumer explicitly “opts-out.” Where a consumer chooses to “opt-out,” the EU Personal Data is not necessarily erased or deleted. Various laws require that certain information be maintained on file for a specified period of time for consumer protection purposes.</p>
<p>A consumer may “opt-out” by contacting CoreLogic in writing or by e-mail at the addresses listed below.</p>
<p>With respect to sensitive information (personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual), however, an individual must “opt-in” to the disclosure of the information to a third-party or to the use of this information for a purpose other than its original purpose or that purpose authorized subsequently by the individual. In other words, unless a consumer chooses to provide explicit consent, a disclosure of sensitive information to a third party or for an unauthorized purpose will not be made.</p>
<p><strong>3. Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)</strong></p>
<p>With respect to the transfer of EU Personal Data to third-parties (other than our agents), the principles of “Notice” and “Choice” apply. Accordingly, EU Personal Data is only provided to third-parties for purposes described in the “Notice” section or otherwise disclosed to consumers, and will not be disseminated to a third-party where a consumer has “opted-out” or, in the case of sensitive information, failed to “opt-in.”</p>
<p>CoreLogic may disclose EU Personal Data to our clients and to third-parties acting as our agents who certify that they subscribe to the Safe Harbor Principles or certify that they are subject to the EU Data Protection Directive or a law subject to an adequacy finding by the EU. CoreLogic also may disclose EU Personal Data clients and third-party agents who enter into a written agreement with CoreLogic, in which the client or third-party agent agrees to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles (in instances where EU Personal Data is requested).</p>
<p><strong>4. Access</strong></p>
<p>A consumer may request, in writing, access to all EU Personal Data collected and maintained about him or her. CoreLogic affords the consumer a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate or incomplete, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. In cases where the information is subject to the FCRA, CoreLogic complies with the FCRA’s requirements regarding access and correction rights of consumers.<br>CoreLogic reserves the right to engage in reasonable efforts to confirm the identity of the individual requesting EU Personal Data to ensure the information is provided only to the subject of the data.</p>
<p>To request information relating to his or her EU Personal Data, a consumer may contact CoreLogic in writing at the address listed below or by e-mail at the following email address:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:srumph@corelogic.com">srumph@corelogic.com</a>. In addition, the consumer will be asked to provide sufficient evidence of his or her identity so we may ensure that information is being released to the correct individual. If we are unable to provide the consumer with access to his or her EU Personal Data or to correct the data, we will notify the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>5. Security</strong></p>
<p>CoreLogic takes reasonable procedures to protect EU Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
<p><strong>6. Data Integrity</strong></p>
<p>CoreLogic collects EU Personal Data that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used, consistent with the Safe Harbor Principles. We process EU Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it has been collected (as identified in the Notice section above) or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, CoreLogic takes reasonable steps to ensure that EU Personal Data collected is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.</p>
<p><strong>7. Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>CoreLogic will verify adherence to the EU Safe Harbor Policy via in-house verification and internal policies and procedures implemented by the management of our company. CoreLogic also will cooperate with&nbsp;the European Union Data Protection Authorities&nbsp;as a means of providing consumers a readily available and affordable recourse mechanism by which individual consumer complaints and disputes, if any, can be investigated and remedied.</p>
<p><strong>8. Amendments</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be amended to reflect new products and services, or as necessary to reflect a new business practice. Consistent with the Safe Harbor requirements, we will post any revised policy on this Website.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION</strong></p>
