<li>Information security is important to us and we understand the techniques required to secure this information. Security measures are in place to protect Your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.<br>
<br></li>
<li>Data on our secure pages is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">SSL</span>") technology. Personal Information received directly from You will be stored in a password-protected database located within our secure network behind active state of the art firewall software.<br>
<br></li>
<li>We also employ appropriate organisation measures to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage to Your Personal Information, including agent/employee training and up to date security policies.<br>
<br></li>
<li>Unfortunately the sending of information via the internet cannot be completely secure at all times. Although we will make every reasonable effort to protect Your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed online. In opening an account with us, You accept the potential security risks of internet use and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless it has been proved that we have been negligent. For Your own privacy protection we encourage You not to include sensitive information, for example credit/debit card numbers, in any e-mails sent to us.<br>
<br></li>
<li>The Service operates "AS-IS" and "AS-AVAILABLE," without liability of any kind. Whilst we have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the safety of Your Personal Information, due to the continually evolving state of technology and business, coupled with its complexity, we are not able to guarantee error-free performance in relation to the privacy of Your Personal Information.<br>
<br></li>
<li>Any Personal Information provided by You by way of a written form in relation to account opening is Your responsibility. Where written Personal Information is provided to us as part of an account opening process, You must ensure that You obtain the original form following the electronic input of Your Personal Information.<br>
<br></li>
<li>Protection of any information or images provided to a third-party online site that links to or from the Service, cannot be guaranteed. This includes (without limitation) information collected by any third party managing our affiliate program or any other program, as these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of us.<br>
