<p><b>Log Files</b></p>
<p>Like many Web sites, we collect certain information automatically and store it in log files. This includes information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system and date/time stamp.</p>
<p>We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your shopping cart.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to deliver content specific to your interests. This cookie also allows us to track online courseware progress, which means whether or not an employee has completed a unique online course. We track this information based on your email address which also serves as your username. As such, we tie this personally identifiable information to the cookie. From time to time we also use cookies to track the effectiveness of some of our marketing campaigns and tie personally identifiable information you submit to us to those cookies.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. We set a persistent cookie to store your username, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as surveys, will be limited.</p>
<p><b>Web beacons</b><b> </b></p>
<p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><b>Online Transactions</b></p>
<p>Our Web site uses an order form for customers to purchase products and services (online training). We collect contact information (such as name and billing address), financial information (credit card numbers), and demographic information (zip code). Contact information from the order form is used to fulfill orders and/or send information about our company to our customers.

<p><b>Marketing Surveys</b></p>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in marketing surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>We use this information to create broad demographic profiles as well as to contact you when the survey is complete. For example, we may send the survey participant an email with the results of the survey.</p>
<p>We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>
