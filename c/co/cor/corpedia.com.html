<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>

<p>Corpedia contracts with client organizations to provide corporate ethics and compliance eLearning courseware, risk assessment and other related services.  Personally identifiable information provided to us by our client organizations or information you (unique user) provide to us or that we learn from your use of this Web site is treated as confidential information.  We are not in the business of selling or sharing your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes and we do not share your personal identifiable information with third parties for unknown or unrelated uses.  However, we may share your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction initiated or consented to, by you, to do something you have asked us to do, or to comply with applicable legal requirements.   </p>

<p>Corpedia collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>Our Web site registration form(s) may require customers to give us specific contact information (such as name and e-mail address), unique company information (such as employee ID, department name, business unit, etc) and demographic information (such as gender, ethnicity, zip code, etc).  The extent of information collected depends on unique contractual agreements with our client organizations.  We use this information to register client organization employees for online courseware programs, enable users to participate in online risk assessment surveys and/or contact customers about the services offered by Corpedia. </p>

<p>In terms of demographic/profile data that is collected at our site, we use this data to tailor the visitor’s experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.</p>
