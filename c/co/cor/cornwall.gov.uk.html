<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Cornwall County Council ("the Council") is committed to preserving the 
privacy of all visitors to the <a href="http://www.cornwall.gov.uk">
www.cornwall.gov.uk</a>&nbsp; website ("the Website").&nbsp; This policy is provided 
to inform you how we collect, use and protect the information that you provide 
to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council will ensure that any information it receives will be processed in 
accordance with the principles contained in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the 
policy detailed below.&nbsp; This policy only covers the Website and does not cover 
any third party websites to which links are provided.</p>
<h2>1.&nbsp;Information that the Council collects from you&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>1.1&nbsp;The Council collects information from you in the following ways:</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;1.1.1&nbsp;Information that you provide to the Council</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Website contains feedback forms and questionnaires, which you can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
complete and return if you wish.&nbsp; The forms may ask for your name and contact 
details (eg address, telephone number, email address etc). If you &nbsp;choose to 
complete a questionnaire then you may be asked to provide information on a 
variety of topics and it is at your discretion, if you choose to &nbsp;do so.&nbsp; The 
forms will contain notices letting you know why the Council is requesting the 
information.</p>
<p>You may make an information request and in order to receive a response to 
your question, you may disclose personal information to the Council.&nbsp; The 
Council may also collect information about you from messages you post to the 
Website and emails or letters you send to us.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordering goods and Services</h4>
<p>On the Website you can order goods and services and you will be asked to 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide contact details and debit/credit card details in order to make 
a purchase.</p>
<h2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of your Information</h2>
<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Your information will allow the Council to process and supply any orders 
for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goods and services.&nbsp; It will also enable us to bill you and 
contact you where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary regarding any order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council may use your information to contact you regarding a request 
for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information or to follow up any feedback forms or questionnaires you 
may have completed and returned. </p>
<p>2.3&nbsp;Your personal information will assist the Council in understanding your 
needs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and interests and the information may be analysed in order to 
improve and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; develop the Website and the services provided by the 
Council as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.4 If the Council wishes to use your personal information for a purpose 
other than the one for which you provided the information, it will ask for your 
consent first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council will not disclose your information to other organisations or 
bodies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless required to do so by law.&nbsp; Your information will not be 
sold, rented or &nbsp; leased without your prior written consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.6 If you have ordered goods or services, the Council may have to 
give&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information to agents or subcontractors in order to process and 
deliver your order.&nbsp; If this was necessary, the Council would ensure that agents 
or subcontractors are aware of the obligations in the Data Protection Act 1998 
and this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.7 In the event that the Council transfers management of the Website to a 
third &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; party, you agree that your information can be transferred to that 
third party. The Council will ensure that any third party taking over management 
of the Website will observe the obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 
and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>2.8 The Council will only retain your personal information for as long as 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary to fulfil the purpose(s) for which it was collected.&nbsp; Once 
this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose has been fulfilled, your personal data will be destroyed 
and disposed of in accordance in a secure manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.9 In the event that you no longer consent to the Council processing your 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personal data, please notify the Council in writing.</p>
<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Security&nbsp;</h2>

internet can be intercepted or lost and may be read by others.&nbsp;</p>

and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; practices to protect the information which is collected using the 
Website.</p>

personal information on behalf of the Council are aware of their obligations 
under the Data Protection Act 1998 and this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; services online.&nbsp; The shopping area is a secure site and is

<p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Website is not aimed at children, however, if in the future the 
Council does decide to develop areas within the Website for children, it will 
put into place a special privacy policy aimed at children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>7.&nbsp;Access to your personal information</h2>
