Some CSC services may require additional information which we will inform you of when we request such information.</p>
<h3>4.1. INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</h3>
<p>If you use this website or its various applications, you may be required to provide the following information as part of registration: first name, last name, company name, title, address, city, state, zip, telephone, email address, preferred method of contact (email, phone, postal), account number, service and product interest information, and intended use of services or products. In addition, you may choose to provide additional information relating to yourself or your companies to take advantage of different services available on this website.</p>
<p>We generally do not require you to provide sensitive personal data, such as that which reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or information that concerns health or sex life.</p>
<h3>4.2. LOG FILES </h3>
<p>We also periodically gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data.</p>
<h3>4.3. COOKIES</h3>
<p>CSC is committed to transparency when it comes to the technologies we use, and we've outlined below how we use cookies when you visit our website.</p>
<h3>4.3.1. WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of code issued to your device when you visit a website, which store and sometimes track information about your use of our site. We use cookies to elevate your user experience and the quality of our site and service. When you enter our site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer, which allows us to recognize your computer.</p>
<p>By using our site, you consent to our cookie settings and agree that you understand our cookie policy, which explains how you can manage your cookie choices and preferences. Please be aware that restricting cookies will impact your user experience and may prevent you from using part of our website.</p>
<p>Cookies can be removed from your browser in two ways: automatically (when they expire), or when you manually delete them. We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies we use and how you can manage them.</p>
<h3>4.3.2. WHY DOES CSC USE COOKIES?</h3> 
<p>CSC's primary reason for using cookies is to make our website work more effectively.</p>
<h3>4.3.3. WHAT KINDS OF COOKIES DOES CSC USE AND WHY?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Session cookies: These temporary cookies expire and are automatically erased whenever you close your browser. We use session cookies to grant our customers access to content and to enable commenting.</li>
<li>Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering our users' preferences and choices when using our site or to target advertising.</li>
<li>First- and third-party cookies: Whether a cookie is "first" or "third" party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. In basic terms, first-party cookies are set by a website visited by the userâ€“the website displayed in the URL window. Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain, such as google.com, other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.</li>
<li>Remarketing: CSC uses remarketing. Placing a remarketing tag on our website can help us reach visitors who have previously visited our website as they visit other sites on the Google Display NetworkTM service or search on GoogleÂ®. Using remarketing, these visitors will be shown messages tailored to which sections of our site they visited. The remarketing tag uses third-party cookies from the Google Display Network. Visitors can opt-out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google Ads settings. Remarketing tags are not used on CSC's microsites such as <a href="https://www.cscdigitalbrand.services/" target="_blank">cscglobal.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://www.cscdigitalbrand.services/de" target="_blank">cscglobal.de</a>, <a href="https://www.cscdigitalbrand.services/es" target="_blank">cscglobal.es</a> and <a href="https://www.cscdigitalbrand.services/fr" target="_blank">cscglobal.fr</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.3.4. WHAT OTHER COOKIES MIGHT YOU ENCOUNTER ON THE CSC WEBSITE?</h3>
<p>We may also use third-party cookies on the site. In keeping with our policies, these session or persistent cookies are set only by trusted partners of CSC.</p>
<p>The third-party cookies we may use on our website may track site performance and usage, monitor chat sessions or a users' location, or compile reports that help us improve the site. When you access our website, in certain jurisdictions, as required by law, you will receive a clear notice advising you that we intend to use cookies and that you must click an "I accept" box in order for cookies to be placed.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies through our website you can set your browser to either reject all cookies (see below), to allow only "trusted" websites to set them, or to accept only those cookies from those sites you currently use. If you access our website in Europe, you can refuse to click the "I accept" box or click the "I disagree" box when you are presented with a cookie notice on our homepage.</p>
<p>When you access our website outside of Europe, our system will automatically issue cookies when you log on to our website (unless you have set your browser to reject them).</p>
<h3>4.3.5. COOKIES WE DO NOT USE</h3> 
<p>We do not use flash cookies (sometimes known as local shared objects or LSOs).</p>
<h3>4.3.6. DOES CSC USE COOKIES TO SELL CUSTOMER INFORMATION?</h3>
