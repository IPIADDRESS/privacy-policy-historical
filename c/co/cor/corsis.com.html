<h2>Surveys/Polls</h2>
<p class="body">At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally 
aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reactions 
to a particular article. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual 
subscribers and is used internally to better market our services, participation is voluntary. 
In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely 
for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.</p>

required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants' identities and notifying the winners. 
If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered by a third party, this information will be disclosed 
to that third party. However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the 
information is not connected with their User Names.</p>
