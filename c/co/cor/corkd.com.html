    of the Corkd.com website (the "<u>Site</u>").  Your use of the Site 
    constitutes your acceptance of the Terms, including the terms and conditions 
    of this Privacy Policy.  In the event of any conflict, inconsistency 
    or ambiguity between the Terms and this Privacy Policy, the Terms shall

    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Collection 
    and Use of Information.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When you register 
    with Corkd to become an authorized User, you will be required to submit 
    certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, email 
    address, gender and city of residence.  We may also collect other 
    Information from you from time to time including your username and password.  
    Furthermore, after you have become an authorized User you may elect 
    to voluntarily provide additional information to Corkd which may enable 
    you to better identify yourself to other Corkd Users. You should note 
    that your Information may be embodied or incorporated in your User Content 
    (as defined in the Terms) and that this Privacy Policy shall not limit 
    the rights granted by you in the Terms with respect to any User Content.  
    You may always refuse to supply any Information with it being understood 
    that such refusal may not allow you to access certain portions of the 
    Site.  </font> <br></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We collect 
    such Information to provide our users with a personalized interface.  
    Additionally, Corkd or its affiliates and business partners (including 
    certain wineries) may use your Information to market to you, and provide 
    you with information about their products and services. We adhere to 
    an opt-in/opt-out policy in communicating with our Users and thus, if 
    you no longer desire to receive any such information or communications 
    from us, please follow the unsubscribed instructions provided in any 
    of the communications.   Please note, however, that if you register 
    as a User on the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving certain administrative 
    and service-related messages.</font> <br></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When Users 
    visit and use the Site, the web-servers serving Corkd may automatically 
    collect and record certain information about such User's use of the 
    Site.  Such information may include a User's IP address, the 
    domain from which the User is using the Site, the web pages visited 
    by the User and other information relating to the User's use of the 
    Site.   Such Information shall be used for administration purposes 
    in connection with an internal review of User's use of the Site.  
    [We also provide this Information (as well as information from third-party 
    market researchers) about our Users on an aggregated, anonymous basis 
    to our advertisers.  Any Information provided by subscribers online 
    as part of an advertiser promotion online (i.e. online coupons) may 
    be provided directly to advertisers.]  Please note that certain 
    Information provided by you on the Site or created through your use 
    of the Site must remain publicly available through the Site as it is 
    viable to the community aspect of the Site.  </font> <br>

    Policy only applies to information collected by Corkd.  Corkd does 
    not control the privacy policies of our affiliates and business partners 
    which may be accessed, directly or indirectly, through the Site.  
    Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third party 
    sites may be subject to the privacy of those sites, if any.  It 
    is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable 
    restrictions on the disclosure of the Information on these third party 
    sites and Corkd is not to be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of 
    your Information by any other third party. You should also be aware 
    that if you submit information to "forums", "chat-rooms" or 
    other "message boards", such information may be deemed public information 
    and you might lose any privacy rights you may have with respect to such 
    information.</font> <br></p>

    and determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed 
    to access certain material on the Site. Data in cookies may be read

    us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally 
    identifiable information. By adjusting settings on your browser, you 
    may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.  Third party websites 
    linked to on the Site may also contain cookies.  Corkd does not

    Providers.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We hire third-party 
    vendors to provide specialized services such as customer support, hosting, 
    security, caching, email message deployment, suppression, merge and 
    de-duplication services, data processing, and special products or services 
    that you have requested.  These companies are only allowed to use 
    the Information in order to help us fulfill our services to you.  
    We do not provide your Information to these companies for their own, 
    permanent use.</font> <br></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Change in 
    Control.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We are always 
    seeking to improve the Site and our business. In accomplishing these 
    objectives, we may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies 
    in our business family may merge with, sell all or substantially all 
    of its assets to, or be acquired by another company. We may transfer 
    some or all of your Information as a part of these or similar transactions 
    in order that the service being provided to you may continue or for 
    other business purposes.</font> <br></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Foreign 
    Jurisdiction.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When a Member 
    who is located in a country other than the United States chooses to 
    post User Content or Information that will be publicly disclosed, that 
    User is responsible for ensuring that such Information or Content conforms 
    to all local data protection laws.  Corkd is not responsible under 
    any privacy laws or local data protection laws in any jurisdiction other 
    than the United States for any such posted information.</font></p>

    with Laws.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Corkd will 
    disclose any Information to any government or law enforcement officials 
    or private parties as Corkd shall determine, in its sole and absolute 
    discretion, is necessary or appropriate to respond to any claim or to 
    comply with any legal process to protect the rights of Corkd or any 
    other third party or to comply with any international, federal, state 
    or local law, regulation or ordinance or to prevent or stop any illegal, 
    unethical or actionable activity.  </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Modification 
    of Terms.</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">From time to 
    time Corkd may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect, among other things, 
    changes in the law or our Information collection and use practices and 
    such modifications shall be effective upon posting by Corkd on the Site. Your 
    continued use of the Site after a revised Privacy Policy signifies your 
    acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that 
    you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as 
    to any changes.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Miscellaneous.  </b></font></p>
