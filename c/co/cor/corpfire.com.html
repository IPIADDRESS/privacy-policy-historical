			<br>
			<h4 class="subheader">Your Profile</h4>
			 When you register with us, sign up for an application or service, become a member of a company profile or make recommendations on the service, we use certain information we collect from you (your name, business, and location of your business) to set up a profile on your behalf to share with others, and which information will be available by search to help you promote your business or profession. After you register with CorpFire, you may provide additional member information about yourself (member profile, company profile) and add company profile information/pictures about your business in the My Profile/Members Home area on CorpFire.

			<br>
			 The contents of your online communications, as well as other information about you as a CorpFire user, may be accessed and disclosed in response: to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena), in other circumstances in which we have a good faith belief that a crime has been or is being committed by a user, that an emergency exists that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person, when necessary either to protect our property, or for us to render the service you have requested. <br>
			<br>
			 In the event that our ownership was to change as a result of a merger or acquisition by another company or any other change, your CorpFire information may be transferred. <br>
