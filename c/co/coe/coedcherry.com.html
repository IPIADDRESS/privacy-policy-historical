    <h1>CoedCherry's position on privacy</h1>

    <p>When I entered the porn business in 2003 I was an unemployed computer nerd, having worked for two years as a programmer and one year
        as a systems administrator. Nerds are notoriously paranoid about privacy and security on the Internet, because
        we know how easily our personal information can be apprehended and abused.</p>

    <p>As surfers it's important we have safe and legal places to go. Sites that won't violate our privacy, give us viruses or shove ads in our faces.
        CoedCherry represents years of work to make a site that doesn't just offer high quality porn, but also a site that is safe and protects your privacy.</p>

    <p>I believe that it is your right to know exactly what kind of information is being collected about you, why it is collected, how it is being collected,
        what is done with that information and how long it is kept.</p>

    <h1>Google Analytics</h1>

    <p>Like millions of other websites, CoedCherry uses Google Analytics to help make CoedCherry better.</p>

    <p>Google Analytics is a piece of software that grabs data about our visitors (you). Its something like an advanced server log.</p>

    <p><strong>What information does Google Analytics record?</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>What website (or search engine) you came from to get here</li>
        <li>How long you stay for</li>
        <li>What kind of computer youre using</li>
        <li>What country / area of the world you are in</li>
        <li>And quite a bit more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this data is <strong>anonymous</strong>. Here are some things Google Analytics does <strong>NOT</strong> collect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your name (not collected)</li>
        <li>Your address (not collected)</li>
        <li>Your e-mail address(es) (not collected)</li>
        <li>Your age (not collected)</li>
        <li>Your gender (not collected)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The information Google Analytics collects allows us to better understand the kind of people who come here and what content theyre enjoying.
        This allows us to make better decisions about what kind of content to provide in the future.</p>

    <p>All of this activity falls within the bounds of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>.

    </p><p>You can <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">opt out of Googles advertising tracking cookie</a> or use a <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">browser plugin to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking software</a>.</p>

    <h1>What information is collected in addition to Google Analytics?</h1>

    <p>In addition to Google Analytics we measure the total amount of clicks that content on our site receives (gallery, pay-site link,
        model page, thumbnail, etc.) Currently these numbers are statistical only, i.e: we only count the total clicks received without knowing who
        specifically clicked on what.</p>

    <p>In the future we may measure individual clicks for the purpose of making recommendations (ex: People who like this gallery also like ...). We will update
        this page if and when we begin to measure individual clicks.</p>

    <h1>Cookies</h1>

    <p>A cookie is information that a web-site stores in your browser and retrieves later when you return. Cookies are the primary
        way that sites track you. Without them you couldn't "log in" to places like Facebook or Gmail.</p>

    <p>In addition to cookies used by Google Analytics, CoedCherry also sets a cookie so we can give different content for returning
        visitors v.s. new visitors. For example, the main page gives first-time visitors the most popular galleries, and returning visitors
        are shown the newest galleries.</p>

    <h1>Server logs</h1>

    <p>We keep server logs to monitor the health of our servers. These logs contain non-personal information about you.</p>

    <p>Here is an actual example of an entry (with the IP addresses censored for privacy):</p>

    <p class="log">X.X.X.X, X.X.X.X - - [22/Jun/2013:13:36:47 -0500] "GET /galleries/8398 HTTP/1.0" 200 4035 "http://www.coedcherry.com/galleries?sort=popularity&amp;page=11" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_4) AppleWebKit/536.30.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.5 Safari/536.30.1"</p>

    <p>Each part explained:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="log">X.X.X.X, X.X.X.X</span><br>IP addresses</li>
        <li><span class="log">[22/Jun/2013:13:36:47 -0500]</span><br>The date and time of the request</li>
        <li><span class="log">"GET /galleries/8398 HTTP/1.0"</span><br>The request type, requested page and the HTTP protocol version</li>
        <li><span class="log">200 4035</span><br>The response status our server sent (200 OK) and the size of the document (4035 bytes)</li>
        <li><span class="log">"http://www.coedcherry.com/galleries?sort=popularity&amp;page=11"</span><br>The web page the person came from</li>
        <li><span class="log">"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_4) AppleWebKit/536.30.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.5 Safari/536.30.1"</span><br>
            The "User Agent" data provided by the web browser to our server. This data is provided by your browser to every site you visit in order to tell the site what kind of browser and operating system
            you are using. In this example we can tell that the person is using Safari 6.0.5 on Mac OS X 10.8.4.
            There are browser plugins that can disable or change this information. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Server logs are stored on our servers for 7 days, after which they are deleted.</p>

    <h1>Malware</h1>

    <p>Malware is software that is installed on your computer without your knowledge or consent and used to either collect information about you, show you unwanted advertisements
        or use your computer's resources in ways in which you do not intend.</p>

    <p>CoedCherry <strong>does not</strong> distribute or use any kind of malware. We never have and we never will. It is evil and we believe it should be illegal (fortunately in many cases it is).</p>

    <h1>Is the content (pictures) on CoedCherry legal?</h1>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>CoedCherry is a business that has been operating in Canada since October 2003 and we plan to continue long into the future. We have a reputation that we
        strive to protect.</p>

    <p>It is unfortunate that the adult industry sometimes has a reputation for being "shady." In the overwhelming majority of cases it is undeserved and is the result of social prejudices based
        on beliefs that we do not share. CoedCherry's position is that sex is both natural and beautiful, and pornography is perfectly moral as
        long as it is produced and enjoyed by consenting adults. That is the type of material that CoedCherry provides.</p>

    <p>Every picture comes from a site that charges memberships. These sites own the copyright and give us permission to use the pictures to promote their sites. When someone
        purchases a membership via one of our galleries, we are paid a commission in exchange for earning that company money. We make sure to only deal with reputable
        companies that are well known and established in the adult industry.</p>

    <p>In most cases we provide a link at the bottom of each gallery titled "18 USC 2257." This link will take you to the record holder information for that content; the person
        who maintains the identification and legal documentation for the models appearing in that gallery. As a Canadian company we are not required by law to provide this information but
        we choose to do so voluntarily as an assurance that the content is legal.</p>

    <p>Occasionally someone contacts us and claims that a picture hosted on our site is of them and is being used without their permission. These cases are rare and
        are usually the result of a model who had a falling-out with her photographer or company. In these instances our policy is to contact the company that owns the copyright
        for clarification. If the claim holds up we always remove the images permanently. We have <strong>never</strong> been involved in any court case or trial regarding the use of images
        as we respect the wishes of both copyright holders and models and always work to resolve these issues in a diplomatic and civil manner.</p>

    <h1>Who can I contact for further information?</h1>

    <p>If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to use the <a href="/contact">Contact Form</a> to get in touch with us. We will do our best to respond ASAP.</p>
