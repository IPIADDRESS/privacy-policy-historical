<font color="000099" size="4"><b>Information We Share</b></font><br>
We are permitted by law to share information we have about our experiences or transactions with you or your account (such as account balance and your payment history with us or information we may collect such as credit reports and assets and income) with our affiliates. We are also permitted by law to share nonpublic information about you to outside companies or nonaffiliated third parties who participate with us in supplying products and services to customers such as check printing and credit bureaus.
</p><p>
We may also share information about you with a medical care institution or medical professional in order to verify coverage of benefits, inform you of a medical problem of which you may not be aware, or conduct an audit that would enable us to verify treatment.
</p><p>
These nonaffiliated third party companies are not permitted to use our customer information for any purposes other than the services intended.  We will share your information with these companies only if they agree to treat it confidentially.
</p><p>
We may share information we have about you within the Commerce affiliated companies in order to provide you with complete financial solutions.  Under the law, Commerce is permitted to share identification information within the Commerce family of companies, as well as information related to the transactions and experiences we have with our customers.  Commerce and its affiliates engage in many businesses, for example, banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance.  Sharing information among these businesses increases your access to our products and services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific needs and simplifies transaction flows.
</p><p>
We may also disclose information we have about you to companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements or who provide marketing services on our behalf.  For example, we share information about you with an insurance underwriting firm in order that you may receive information concerning various insurance products.
</p><p>
The type of information we may share is:</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide customer information to nonaffiliated companies so they can market non-financial services to you.</b>
</p><p>
Commerce may make a decision to sell a particular line of business (for example, mortgage servicing rights).  Usually, an integral part of that business is its customer database.  Commerce reserves the right, in circumstances such as these, to transfer ownership of such customer databases to the purchaser.
</p><p>
We do not share any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers with anyone, except as permitted by law.
</p><p>
If you terminate your relationship with us, we will adhere to the information policies and practices described in this policy, as well as your opt-out election, with regard to information we have collected on you.
</p><p>
<b>If you do not wish us to share your information among Commerce affiliated companies, nonaffiliated third parties or joint marketers, other than those permitted by law, please call us at 1-888-937-1050.</b>
</p><p>
<font color="000099" size="4"><b>Online Protection</b></font><br>
All of our forms, our Commerce Online Banking, Online Trading, TreasuryDirect and InvestView are protected by data-encryption technology. Encryption is a procedure for turning plain text or other information into an unrecognizable pattern of data requiring a unique key to open or "decode" the formula. The unbroken key or closed lock on your screen indicates that the connection is secure. 
</p><p>
Commerce Online Banking, all of our forms and Commerce Online Trading support two levels of Internet security: 40-bit and 128-bit data encryption. The 128-bit level is more secure than the 40-bit protection because it presents a higher number of possible decoding keys. Commerce defaults to 128-bit encryption, providing that the browser being used supports the 128-bit encryption. If the browser does not support 128-bit encryption, our system will default to 40-bit encryption. Commerce InvestView and Commerce TreasuryDirect can only be accessed through 128-bit encryption.
</p><p>
Although we provide outstanding levels of data encryption to maintain the security of our customers' information, there are certain security, corruption, transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open networks such as the Internet. Should you decide at any time that you prefer not to use our online services, please visit any branch or call us at 1-888-751-9000.   
</p><p>
<font color="000099" size="4"><b>How We Handle E-Mail</b></font><br>
Our website does not require you to disclose any personal identifying information. If, however, you choose to contact us via e-mail, please keep in mind that your e-mail address, and any other information your e-mail header shows about you, such as your name or organization, will be revealed to us in the e-mail.  We pledge, however, that when you communicate with us via e-mail, we will use that information only to respond to the inquiry and provide accurate information to any questions.  Your e-mail address will not be sold, nor will it be shared with others outside of Commerce unless we are compelled to do so by law.
</p><p>
We want to be very clear: we will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 
</p><p>
E-mail shared via Chek.com, the free e-mail service provided through MyCommerceOnline, is not encrypted.

<font color="000099" size="4"><b>No Data "Capture" With Planning Tools</b></font><br>
There are planning tools throughout the site to help you make the financial decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home.  We encourage you to try all of your "what-if" scenarios as often as you like.  Examples include the home loan, auto loan and mortgage payment calculators and the IRA eligibility guides.

Commerce offers a wide array of financial products and services designed to meet your financial goals. We periodically review information regarding our customers' accounts and transactions to select the names, addresses (including e-mail addresses) and telephone numbers of customers to receive special offers of products or services that we believe will be of interest to our customers. We recognize, however, that you might have preferences about how we contact you to let you know about them. You may also prefer for us not to share your <b>non-public personal</b> information, such as application information and credit reports among our Commerce affiliated companies, or you may prefer that we not share information with the <b>nonaffiliated third party</b> companies we select to provide products and services that we do not. If you do not want us to share your information for these purposes or communicate offers to you - call us at 1-888-937-1050.
</p><p>
Please note that, even if you call us to instruct us not to share information about you and your account, information such as credit line and account balance may still by law be provided to our affiliates, to credit bureaus and to third parties with whom we contract to maintain, analyze or service your account(s) at Commerce.
</p><p>
If there are multiple owners on an account, product or policy, any one of them may request on behalf of any or all of the fellow owners that their information is not to be shared or their names removed from our mailing lists.
