<h1>Important
Information
About Your
Privacy</h1>

<h2>Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
<p>Through our subsidiary bank and financial service
companies, we provide a comprehensive line of banking,
investment and insurance services. As a company, we are
committed to protecting the confidentiality of personal
information you provide to any of our subsidiary
companies.<sup>1</sup> At the same time, the information you provide
can help us introduce you to other products and services
that we offer to help you meet your financial goals.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The type of information we collect depends on the type
of product or service you obtain from us. We may collect
“nonpublic personal information” about you. “Nonpublic
personal information” is information about you, which is
not available from public sources, obtained in connection
with providing you with a financial product or service.
For example, nonpublic personal information includes
information regarding your account balance, payment
history and deposit account activity. It also includes your social security number, 
account number and other information associated with you in particular 
through one or more identifiers. We may collect this
nonpublic personal information from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information we receive from you on applications or
other forms you may complete and provide to us, such
as your name, address, social security number, date of
birth, assets, income, and, in the case of applications
for insurance, health and medical information;</li>

<li>Information about your transactions with us, with
members of our corporate family or others, such as
your account balance, payment history, products and
services used, credit card usage; and,</li>

<li>Information such as your creditworthiness, payment
history, and other information that we receive from
outside companies or third parties, such as credit
bureaus, that we require in order to provide the
products or services you have requested.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, we may obtain “protected health
information” about you. “Protected health information” is
information provided by a third party, such as an insurer,
health plan, employer or health care provider that identifies
you and relates to your health or health care, including
payment for that care. Among other things, our insurance
subsidiaries may obtain information regarding your medical
condition if you apply for insurance coverage, and we may
obtain information regarding medical treatment that you
have received in the course of processing payments for that
treatment.</p>

<h2>Information We Disclose</h2>
<p>We share information with our affiliates<sup>2</sup> about our
experiences or transactions with you or your account in
order to help you complete financial transactions or make
you aware of services and products from which you may benefit. 
The personal information we collect and share with affiliates may 
include your name, address, social security number, policy number, 
account number, telephone number, account balance, payment 
history and deposit account activity.</p>

<p>Except as permitted by law, we do not disclose nonpublic
personal information that we have obtained from other
sources to any of our affiliates.</p>

<p>Under certain circumstances, we disclose personal
information about you to “nonaffiliated third parties”
(i.e., third parties that are not our affiliates or part of our
corporate family). For example, we disclose personal
information about you to third parties to assist us in
servicing your account, to government entities as required
by law or regulation, or in response to subpoenas and to
credit bureaus. We will not disclose any nonpublic personal
information about you to any other third parties, except as
permitted by law.</p>

<p>We may disclose all of the information we collect as
described above, except protected health information, to
companies that perform marketing services for us, financial
institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, 
or companies with which we jointly offer products or services, 
such as credit cards or credit insurance.</p>

<p>We will also provide nonpublic personal information to
affiliates and other parties if you request us to do so or you
give us your permission.</p>

<p>If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive
customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies
and practices described in this notice.</p>

<h2>Medical Information</h2>
<p><em>This notice describes how medical information about you may be
used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information.
Please review it carefully.</em></p>

<p>We do not frequently hold protected health information,
but, for example, we may receive protected health
information from a health care provider to assist in
processing payments to that provider. Or, our insurance
subsidiaries may collect protected health information and
provide it to an insurer to assist in processing an insurance
claim or if you enroll to be a participant in a health plan. We
are required to maintain the privacy of protected health
information in accordance with the law and this notice, and
to provide you with notice (including a paper notice upon
request) of our legal duties and practices with respect to
such information. We do not share protected health
information among our affiliates or with third parties except
to process transactions or to provide services you have
requested or initiated. We may use or disclose protected
health information in connection with the payment or
collection of health care costs or insurance premiums, or for
purposes of insurance claim processing, enrollment or
underwriting.</p>

<p>We will not use or disclose your protected health
information for any other purpose without your written
authorization, which you may revoke, or as otherwise
required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>You have the right to request restrictions on our use or
disclosure of your protected health information, although
we are not required to agree to a requested restriction.
You have the right to request that we communicate your
protected health information to you in a confidential
manner. You have the right to inspect, copy and, if it is
erroneous, amend your protected health information. And,
you have the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of
your protected health information, although that right does
not apply to disclosures to you or for purposes of treatment,
payment or health care operations.</p>

<p>You may make any complaint about our use or disclosure
of protected health information directly to us, or to the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and you will not
be retaliated against for filing a complaint. If you wish to
complain to us, or if you have any questions, please contact
us as follows:</p>

Management, P.O. Box 9540, Portland, ME 04112-9540<br>
Tel: 800-211-1979</strong></em></p>

<h2>Our Security Procedures</h2>
<p>Access to your personal and account information is
restricted to those employees who need to know that
information as part of their job, to service your account or to
provide products and services to you. We maintain physical,
electronic and procedural safeguards that are reasonably
designed to guard your nonpublic personal information.</p>

<h2>Accuracy of Customer Information</h2>
<p>We recognize that the accuracy of your personal and
account information is critical to you and, to that end, we
follow procedures to reasonably ensure the accuracy of your
information. If you find that any information we have on
file or have reported to another party does not appear to be
accurate, please write to us at:</p>

<p><em><strong>Commerce Bank, Attention: Customer Service Center,<br>
P.O. Box 5400, Cherry Hill, NJ 08034-0211</strong></em></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><em><strong>TD Banknorth, Attention: Loan and Account Research,<br>
32 Chestnut St., Lewiston, ME 04240</strong></em></p>

<p>Please include your account or policy number.</p>

<h2>Internet Banking Privacy</h2>
<p>Safeguarding your personal information when interacting
with us via the Internet is also extremely important. We
apply the standards discussed previously in caring for your
personal information. When browsing our website, personal
information, such as your e-mail address, is not collected.
Some areas of our website require information, such as your
e-mail address or your account number, to enable you to
perform certain tasks (e.g., to review your accounts or
correspond with us). In these cases, we collect the
information necessary to interact with you.</p>

<p>If you visit us on the Internet, we may place a “cookie” on
your browser that records the number of visits made to our
various web pages; however, personal information is not
collected. If you use our Online Banking or eBillPay
programs, you may receive additional cookies which
contain your unique identifier, allowing you to view and
manage your accounts. These cookies may be linked to
personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>E-mail sent within our online banking system is secure.
The secure online transmission of information to us is only
available from within your online banking account; after
you have established a secure connection using Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. You may also contact us by
phone, postal mail or in person.</p>

<p>We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address
and our response so that we can more efficiently respond to
any follow-up questions from you. We also retain this
information to meet legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>Regular Internet E-mail is Not Secure</h2>
<p>Please do not send confidential information such as social
security or account numbers to us via regular e-mail. In
instances where e-mail addresses are provided, they are
provided for information inquiries of a non-sensitive and
non-confidential nature. Since an Internet e-mail response
back to you would not be secure, we will not include
confidential information in an e-mail response.</p>

<h2>Protecting Children Online</h2>
<p>In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 
we will not knowingly collect, store, use or disclose personal
information from children. We define children as persons
under the age of 13.</p>

<p>We do not
accept applications directly from children, knowingly
collect, nor share, personal information about them,
unless the information has been provided by an adult in
connection with opening a deposit account for or with the
child. We won’t send any unsolicited promotions to users
who indicate they are less than 13 years of age unless the
solicitation is in connection with an account opened by an
adult.</p>

<p>This does not prevent parents from opening deposit accounts
on behalf of their children. We will obtain parental consent
prior to the creation of an account on behalf of a child.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>We’re strongly committed to our relationship with you and
want to be sure you understand the steps we have taken to
protect your personal information. If you have any
questions or comments, please call us at the appropriate
number listed on the back of this statement.</p>

<h2>The Problem of Identity Theft</h2>
<p>Identity theft is a growing crime in our country. Each day,
thousands of people become victims of identity theft.
Identity theft occurs when someone steals your personal
information and uses it to establish credit, charge items, or
borrow money using your name.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Identity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shred unused credit offers and other documents
  containing personal or financial information before discarding them.</li>
<li>Guard your social security number.</li>
<li>Don’t release information to people you do not
  know, especially over the phone or Internet.</li>
<li>Review bank statements for accuracy.</li>
<li>If you are denied credit for no apparent
  reason, obtain a copy of your credit report.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>If You Become a Victim</h2>
<ul>
<li>Contact your bank and all others with whom you have a
  financial relationship.</li>
<li>File a police report if you have had a loss.</li>
<li>Report the fraud to the major credit bureaus:
<ul>
<li>Equifax 	800-525-6285</li>
<li>Experian 	888-397-3742</li>
<li>Trans Union 	800-680-7289</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>TD Banknorth, Inc.</h2>
<p>This privacy statement applies to the following companies
within TD Banknorth, Inc., including TD Bank USA, N.A.,
and the divisions and subsidiaries of TD Bank, N.A.
operating under the names of TD Banknorth and
Commerce Bank.</p>

<h2>It’s Your Choice</h2>
<p><em>Effective: September 1, 2008</em></p>
<p>Federal law gives you the right to 
limit some, but not all, marketing from our affiliates. Federal law also requires 
us to give you this notice to tell you about your choice to limit marketing from 
our affiliates. You may limit our affiliates — which include but are not limited to banking, leasing, insurance, 
wealth management, securities brokerage and investment advisory affiliates in 
the TD Bank Financial Group, as well as in the TD Banknorth Inc. group of 
companies providing this notice — from marketing their products or services 
to you based on personal information that we may collect about you and share 
with them. This information includes your account history with us. Your choice 
to limit marketing offers from our affiliates will apply until you tell us to 
change your choice. You can opt back in at any time.</p><p>To limit affiliate marketing offers, contact us either by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Phone: <strong>888-937-1050</strong></li>
	<li>Web: <a href="http://commerceonline.com/opt">commerceonline.com/opt</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you have previously informed us of your preference, you do not need to do so again.</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: Your preference will be processed within 30 days of receipt and will remain 
in place until you change your option. Your preference may not prevent you from 
being solicited with information already held by or previously shared with our 
affiliates based on information that the affiliate had on file prior to
