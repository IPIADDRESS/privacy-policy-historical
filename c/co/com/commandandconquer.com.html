Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, including AOL or other service providers, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Electronic Arts. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.  If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Electronic Arts site, you should consult that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information. </p><p><b><a name="infoCollected">What personal information is collected?</a></b><br>   Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you on-line or off-line. Electronic Arts only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during (1) contests (registration or claiming a prize), (2) warranty registration and/or during customer support or technical service requests, (3) player match up services, (4) registration for games or special game-specific event participation, (5) marketing surveys and email campaigns, (6) registration for membership on our sites, (7) when you order products from us online, or (8) when you request services from third party service providers on our site. Information collected may include your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address and birth date. We do not require personal information to obtain access to any of our sites; however, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>  <p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>  <p><i><a name="store">EA's Online Stores</a></i><br> Visitors purchasing goods and services through one of our online stores may need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address(es), phone number and e-mail address.</p>  <p><i><a name="jobPostings">Job Postings</a></i><br> Electronic Arts allows for the online submission of resumes. Please note that the information (including personal information) collected from a resume is not subject to this privacy policy. However, we want to assure you that information obtained from your resume will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating your submission for a job.</p>  <p><i><a name="online">Online Chat Rooms and Profiles</a></i><br>You may choose to disclose information about yourself in our online chatrooms or in creating user “profiles” when you play games on our sites. Information that you disclose in chat rooms or in “profile” information is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in either place. Please see our <a href="http://www.ea.com/global/legal/tos.jsp">Terms of Service</a> on this point and for other guidelines about posting content on our web sites. </p>  <p><b><a name="underage">A Special Note About Children</a></b><br>   Electronic Arts encourages parents to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, with respect to children residing in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Electronic Arts' online sites by children 12 years of age or under. In order for children 12 years old and under in such jurisdictions to participate in online activities that require registration, we require prior written permission or other verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. In other jurisdictions, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may be required from a parent or guardian for children under 14 or 18 years of age.  Upon registration, the appropriate permission form will be made available.    A copy of our permission form can be found at <a href="javascript:void(0)" onmouseover="window.status=''; return true" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true" onclick="javascript:window.open('/global/legal/register_child_fax.jsp','PopUpPage1','toolbar=yes,width=800,height=580,resizable,scrollbars');"> http://www.ea.com/global/legal/register_child_fax.jsp</a>.  This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Electronic Arts by fax or mail to the  <a href="http://ea4.dev.ea.com/global/legal/privacy/privacy_contacts.jsp">Privacy Policy Administrator</a>  in the relevant country.  Children 12 and under may not participate on certain of our sites. In some cases, we may not permit children under 14 or 18 years of age to participate in certain of our sites.</p> <p> Once we have obtained parental consent, we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. </p>  <p>If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct or complete, should you wish to have your child's personal information deleted from our records, or if you want Electronic Arts to discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information, please contact your <a href="http://ea4.dev.ea.com/global/legal/privacy/privacy_contacts.jsp">Privacy Policy Administrator</a>  who will  be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate.</p>  <p><b><a name="cookies">What about cookies?</a></b><br> Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites. Certain of our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and for other purposes.  For example, certain of our sites use “cookies” or other methods to monitor website usage. We collect information on what games are played, how much time is spent playing the games and which ads or links are clicked. We may link cookie information to personal information.</p> <p>Certain of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and Electronic Arts does not have access to this information. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies whenever you visit a website. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas of our sites will not function properly if you do so.</p> <p>DoubleClick, the company that serves many of the ads that appear on the pogo.com site, may also collect information regarding your activities online, including the sites you visit. Other ad serving companies may also collect similar information. For more information on DoubleClick's services and how you can opt out of those services, please visit DoubleClick's website. For more information about the practices of some of the other large ad serving companies that may collect information on your use of the site, you should visit AdKnowledge, Avenue A and MediaPlex, and Redwood Digital to view their privacy statements and opt out policies.</p>  <p><b><a name="infoProvided">What happens to the information provided?</a></b><br>   Electronic Arts does not disclose any personal information about children under 18 years of age who have registered on any of our websites to third parties, <u>regardless of parental consent</u>, or share or disclose personal information other than as set forth in this policy, provided however, that in the event of a merger, acquisition, or the unlikely event of bankruptcy, management of Electronic Arts’ customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign.</p>   <p>If you register to become a member of EA.com (our online games service), and you are 18 years of age or older, your email address is also provided to our partner, America Online, Inc. and you are automatically registered for an AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) Account. AOL will email you directly concerning your AIM account. If you register to become a member of pogo.com, your user name is reserved for you on AOL, but your email address is not provided to AOL. As with all third party sites, Electronic Arts does not control AOL’s privacy policies and practices. We urge you to review AOL’s privacy policy at www.aol.com.</p>   <p>Members may register for other services from our site(s) (for example, MyPoints on pogo.com). If you opt in to any of these services, we may collect additional information requested by a service provider and pass this information, together with all other registration information (including personal information), to that service provider. Use of your information by a service provider will be governed by that service provider’s terms of service and privacy policy. We may also retain any additional information collected for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Participation in these other related services is optional and is not required to play games on pogo.com or ea.com, or participate in any of our other web sites.</p>     <p>The personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may provide your personal information to such third parties. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. You may opt out of this service. See the opt out information below.</p>   <p>We may use survey information in marketing surveys to select and direct advertising that is more likely to be of interest to a particular member.
