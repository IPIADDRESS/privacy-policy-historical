Because we are committed to serving the needs of our customers, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of their relationship with us.</p>
<h2>Protecting Customer Information</h2>
<p>Access  to your personal information is limited to those Commerce employees who need to  know the information to provide products and services to you. We maintain  physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal  regulations to protect your <strong>non-public information</strong>.</p>

<h2>Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account</h2>
<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask you to send a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents.</p> 

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect <strong>non-public, personal</strong> information  about you to help serve your financial needs, provide customer service, offer  new products or services, and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. These types of <strong>non-public, personal</strong> information may include:</p>
		

     
        <ul>
          <li>Information we  received from you on loan applications or other forms.</li>
        <li>Information  about your transactions with Commerce or others.</li>
        <li>Information from  outside companies or third parties, such as credit bureaus, motor vehicle  reports and demographic information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We collect only the information necessary  to deliver quality products and services to our customers.</p>
<h2>Information We Share</h2>
<p>We are permitted by law to share  <strong>non-public information</strong> about you with outside companies or <strong>non-affiliated, third  parties</strong> that participate with us in supplying products and services to you,  such as check printers. We are permitted, or required, by law to share your  information with credit bureaus and government entities in responding to  subpoenas and other legal processes, as well as those companies with whom you have  requested us to share information.</p>

  <p>These <strong>non-affiliated, third party</strong>  companies are not permitted to use your information for any purposes  other than the services intended. We will share your information with these  companies only if they agree to treat it confidentially.</p>
		<p>The type of information we may share is:</p>
		
          <ul>
            <li>Information we  receive from you on loan applications or other forms, such as name, address,  social security number, assets and income.</li>
            <li>Information  about transactions with Commerce, such as account balances and payment history.</li>
          </ul>
		  <p>We may also disclose information we have  about you to companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements or who  provide marketing services on our behalf. We may share information about you  with another financial institution to jointly offer financial services to you.</p>
		  <p><strong>We do not sell, rent or otherwise  provide customer information to outside companies so they can market non-financial  services to you.</strong></p>
		  <p>Commerce may make a decision to sell a particular line of business  (for example, mortgage servicing rights). Usually, an integral part of that  business is its customer database. Commerce reserves the right, in  circumstances such as these, to transfer ownership of such customer databases  to the purchaser. We do not share any <strong>non-public, personal </strong>information about our  customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.		  </p>
<h2>Online Protection</h2>
<p>All of our Internet forms and pages with customer or other sensitive information  are protected by data-encryption technology. Encryption is a procedure for  turning plain text or other information into an unrecognizable pattern of data  requiring a unique key to open or "decode" the formula. The unbroken  key or closed lock on your screen indicates that the connection is secure.</p>
<p>Although we provide data encryption and other types of  protection to maintain the security of our customers’ information, there are  certain security, corruption, transmission error and access-availability risks  associated with using open networks such as the Internet. Should you decide at  any time that you prefer not to use our online services, please <a href="http://www.commercepc.com/locations_hours/">visit  any store</a> or call us at 1-888-937-0004. </p>
<h2>How We Handle E-Mail</h2>
<p>Our website does not require you to disclose any personal identifying  information. If, however, you choose to contact us via e-mail, please keep in  mind that your e-mail address, and any other information your e-mail header  shows about you, such as your name or organization, will be revealed to us in  the e-mail. We pledge, however, that when you communicate with us via e-mail,  we will use that information only to respond to the inquiry, provide accurate  information to any questions, and in certain instances, assist in the resetting  of passwords. Your e-mail address will not be sold, nor will it be shared with  others outside of Commerce unless we are compelled to do so by law. </p>
<p>We want to be very clear: we will not obtain personally  identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to  provide such information to us. </p>
		  <h2>About "Cookies"</h2>
<p>To provide better service and a more effective website, we use  "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. A  "cookie" is a small, text file placed on your hard drive by our  webpage server. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable  information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with  other personal information to determine who you are or your e-mail address.</p>
<p>Cookies are commonly used on websites and do not harm your  system. By configuring your preference or options in your browser, you  determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. We use cookies to determine if  you have previously visited our website and for a number of administration  purposes. Third-party sites may also use cookies. </p>
<h2>No Data "Capture" With Planning  Tools</h2>
<p>There are planning tools throughout the site to help you make the financial  decisions that are right for you in the privacy of your home. We encourage you  to try all of your "what-if" scenarios as often as you like. Examples  include the home loan, auto loan and mortgage payment calculators and the IRA  eligibility guides.</p>
<p>When you use various planning tools on our website, the  calculation run on your computer or our server will not include the capture of  your personal information. </p>
		  
<h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
<p>If  you believe we have reported inaccurate information about your account to any  consumer-reporting agency, please let us know in writing. Be sure to include  your complete name, current address, social security number, telephone number, account  number, type of account, specific item of dispute, and the reason you believe  the information is wrong. Please notify us and we will make the necessary  corrections promptly. Send your notice to:</p>
