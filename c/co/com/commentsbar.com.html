                    While it is not our intention to collect any personally identifiable information (“<b>PII</b>”) (except for registration and user support purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy), the data collected may include PII. As part of our privacy measures, we implement certain rules designed to avoid the unintentional collection of PII such as email addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, login information, etc. Such rules are based on known field types, parameters, values and algorithms but they are not foolproof and hence the Software &amp; Services may sometimes, unintentionally, collect unwanted information. We regularly examine and update these rules. <br>

                    <li>We may share your information with certain third parties (including, without limitation, search engines, content providers, and advertising networks and platforms) that provide various services (such as advertising, marketing, analysis, content, and search) in connection with the Software &amp; Services. We take appropriate measures to ensure that no user can be individually identified from the disclosure of such information, and we require these third parties (i) to keep the data secured, (ii) not to use the data for any purpose other than to provide us with services, and (iii) to use the data solely in compliance with this Privacy Policy; and</li>

In order to clarify, we do not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to such Third-Party Content and Services and your access to any Third-Party Content and Services is at your own risk.

We recommended that you read the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such Third-Party Content and Services before using or accessing any of them. <br>
<b><u>Social Networks.</u></b><br><br>You may also choose to activate additional features that provide you with the ability to update and use your favorite social networks directly from the Software &amp; Services. During such activation, you will be asked to grant Trovi permission to compile certain information from such social networks. This information may include friends or contact lists, notes, updates, and photos, and may be used by Trovi to customize the Content available to you through the Software &amp; Services, suggest new features and Content that may be relevant to you, or provide Trovi with data for statistical purposes. The information you allow Trovi to access is that which is presented to you when you choose to activate these features. Please see your social network provider policies for any questions or concerns. You may opt not to grant Trovi access to your social network account(s) at any time by changing your social network settings or by not authorizing Trovi’s access thereto. <br>
<b><u>Cookies and Other Technologies.</u></b><br><br>We may collect or allow third parties to collect, through blocks of code called “pixels” or “web beacons”, certain information about you and send it to our servers and our partners. We or our partners package all or part of this information into small text files called Cookies and send the Cookie to your computer. For example, Cookies may store search queries made through the Software &amp; Services, the web pages you accessed, your interaction with advertisements presented to you via the Software &amp; Services, features you used, your session duration and your configurations and preferences of the Software &amp; Services.<br><br>Such Cookies and other technologies allow us and our partners to recognize you on your next use of, access or visit to the Software &amp; Services, or on your visits or access to our partner’s network (i.e., sites and services outside of Trovi).<br><br>Trovi and/or its partners use Cookies and other tracking technologies to:<ul>
                    <li>facilitate and enhance your interaction and activities with the Software &amp; Services;</li>
                    <li>help Trovi learn how you Use the Software &amp; Services, what parts are most attractive and interesting to you, and what kind of offers you like to see;</li>
                    <li>provide you with personalized content which may include interest-based information, online ads or other marketing materials on or through the Software &amp; Services and on third party websites and properties;</li>
                    <li>analyze the information collected from you and help manage and optimize the Software &amp; Services;</li>
                    <li>track and measure various performance and demographic parameters of advertising campaigns including, without limitation, analyzing which ads your browser has loaded, which site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered or accessed, and your interaction with the ad.</li>
                </ul>
                    Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies but you can reset your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is sent. However, some functions of the Software &amp; Services may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled. By using the Software &amp; Services, you affirmatively consent to the collection of information and Cookies as described above. <br>
<b><u>Children under 13.</u></b><br><br>The Software &amp; Services are not intended for users under the age of 13 and you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect, use, share or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage, so that we can verify that minors under the age of 13 are not using the Software &amp; Services.<br><br>We advise parents and guardians to regularly monitor their children's use of email and other online communications and activities. Control tools that create a safer online environment for children are available from third-party online services and software providers.<br><br>In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the age of 13 is using the Trovi Software, we will prohibit and block such a user from accessing the Software &amp; Services, and will make all efforts to promptly delete any PII with regard to such user, as applicable.<br><br>If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her PII without your consent, please contact us as provided in this Privacy Policy and we will take the necessary steps to remove that information from our database.<br>
<b><u>Access.</u></b><br><br>You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through your use of the Software &amp; Services. In such case, we may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity. <br>
<b><u>Data Retention.</u></b><br><br>We retain the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as necessary to fulfill our business and/or operational purposes or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize parts of the information we collect so that it can no longer be identifiable or attributable to any person if we want to keep it for longer periods of time. <br>
<b><u>Transfer of Data Outside Your Territory.</u></b><br><br>The Software &amp; Services work over the Internet. We may store and process information in various locations throughout the globe. If you are a resident of a European Union Member State or another jurisdiction where transfer of your PII to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you hereby provide us with your express consent to such transfer of your data.   <br>
<b><u>Information Security.</u></b><br><br>We implement measures to secure your PII that we collect in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute information security. Therefore, although we make efforts to secure your PII, we cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that the Software &amp; Services and its databases are immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions, access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse. <br>
<b><u>Do Not Track.</u></b><br><br>Do Not Track is a privacy preference that can be configured in certain web browsers (the <b>"DNT Feature"</b>); the DNT Feature, when enabled on a web browser, signals the websites you visit that you do not want certain information about the websites visited collected. As the Internet industry is in the process of defining how to interpret signals sent by the DNT Feature, Trovi does not currently respond or recognize DNT Feature signals. <br>
<b><u>Changes to This Privacy Policy.</u></b><br><br>We may, from time to time, change this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to visit and review this Policy frequently to stay informed. Prior to any material change to this Privacy Policy, Trovi will present you with a detailed notification (e.g., a pop-up notification or other reasonable means) of such change including information on how you may uninstall the Software &amp; Services. Other changes, including amendments made to the Policy to comply with legal requirements, will become effective immediately upon their initial posting. Trovi will also update the "Last updated” date at the end of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Software &amp; Services after any change takes effect will indicate your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must avoid any further use of the Software &amp; Services. <br>
<b><u>How to Contact Trovi.</u></b><br><br>If you have any concerns or questions with respect to any matter covered by this Privacy Policy, you may contact us by email at: <a href="mailto:privacy@trovi.com">privacy@trovi.com</a> or at the following address:<br><br>ClientConnect Ltd.<br>26 HaRokmim Street, Azrieli Center 1<br>Building A, 4th Floor<br>Holon 5885849<br>Israel<br>Last updated: November 12, 2014   <br>
