            This privacy policy governs your use of a software application (“Application”) that was created using the Conduit Platform (<a href="http://www.conduit.com/">http://www.conduit.com/</a>) by one of your favorite brands or web publishers (“Publisher”). The Application includes various features and content that are offered and delivered to you by the Publisher, such as: news, messages, games, and more as well as features and content that you may choose to add.
            <br>
            <br>
            Conduit is committed to protecting your privacy and safety rights while using the Application. Conduit does not collect any personal information from you other than as described in this policy and enforces strict privacy policies.  Conduit requires the Publisher and third parties that may provide you with content, to protect your privacy rights and maintain the following privacy practices:
        </div>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <strong>No Spyware Policy</strong> – the Application does NOT collect or transmit Personally Identifiable Information and does not monitor your personal use of the Application.  Personally Identifiable Information means information that would identify you personally.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Application sends unidentifiable and non-personal statistical data to enable quality assurance and improve support processes. Such non-personal data includes unidentifiable and general usage of the Application (for example; statistical usage data can be sent if you open or close the Application but not personal information you may share via the Application) but does not include Personally Identifiable Information, other than as specifically described herein. You may choose not to send such statistical data at any time from the Options dialog box of the Application. Conduit strives to provide you information and services that you will find useful and interesting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third Party Features and Content</strong> – the Publisher or you may choose to add features or content to the Application. In the event that such features or content may require the collection of your personally identifiable information (for example: your login credentials to a third party website, information about content you use on the web, etc.) the Publisher or the third parties providing the content must present to you a clear disclosure of the information that will be collected and you should have the opportunity to decide whether or not to share such information or alternatively not use or remove the content. Conduit encourages you to read the terms of service and privacy policies offered by the Publisher and the third parties prior to using any of their content or features.
                <br>
                <br>
                You may choose to add additional content and features to the Application as part of your ongoing usage. Conduit encourages you to read the terms of service and the privacy policy of any such content before you choose to add it to the Application.
                <br>
                <br>
                You may also choose to activate additional features that provide you with the ability to update and use your favorite social networks. During such activation you will be asked to grant Conduit permission to collect certain information from such social network systems. If you elect to permit Conduit to access this information, Conduit will be able to see and to use such information regardless of your privacy settings with such social network service.  Such information may include friends or contacts lists, notes and updates and photos.   Such information may be used by Conduit to help you personalize your Application or suggest new features and content that may be relevant to you. Such information will be protected by Conduit in accordance with its strict privacy policies [as can be seen here - <a href="http://www.conduit.com/privacy">http://www.conduit.com/privacy</a>] We urge you to read this policy in its entirety, <strong>but it is important to note that Conduit does not sell or rent any personal information we collect to any third parties. </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No Adware Policy</strong> - You will not be required to view obtrusive ads in order to use the application.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Unobtrusive</strong> – the Application does not enable other software applications to access data stored on your computer's hard drive or in your personal online accounts. Changing your web search preferences, modifying web pages that you visit or accepting third party offers is not required in order to use the Application. You may voluntarily opt to change your search preferences (if applicable), add components or accept notifications, offers or other features from your Publisher.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Easy uninstall</strong> – you can easily uninstall the Application at any time by using standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your operating system, your internet browser or similar software uninstall options (for example: add/remove programs in Windows, Add-on removal in Firefox, etc.).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Easy deactivation</strong> – you can easily deactivate your Application at any time by using the standard deactivation features available in your internet browser (for example: by clicking the "View" menu in your browser selecting the name of the Application and then clicking on it).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Full control</strong> – you have full control over the Application and can modify your preferences at any time (including the components and features you have added to the Application), from the Options dialog box of the Application.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Report – </strong> The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have a reason to believe that your rights have been infringed upon while using the Application, please contact Conduit via email at <a href="mailto:Privacy@conduit.com">Privacy@conduit.com</a> . Once your e-mail is received, Conduit will review it to ensure that the privacy practices provided herein are enforced.
