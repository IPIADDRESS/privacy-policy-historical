                    This Privacy Policy statement supplements the practices and 
                    policies stated within the Subscriber Agreement (and associated 
                    product Schedules), Relying Party Agreement and Comodo Certification 
                    Practice Statement (CPS). Please refer to these documents

                  <p><span class="p4">Informational Collection and Use</span><br>
                    Comodo do not collect any information on customers without 
                    consent. As part of the service offerings, customers will 
                    be prompted for information when enrolling for a certificate, 
                    downloading a product or requesting further information. No 
                    information is collected about a customer if just browsing 
                    the website.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Certificate enrolment</span><br>
                    When enrolling for a certificate, customers will be required 
                    to provide certain information as per the requirements for 
                    the certificate product type. The exact informational requirements 
                    are set out in the relevant Subscriber Agreement and associated 
                    schedules and listed in the Comodo CPS. Some of the submitted 
                    details will be displayed within the certificate and as a 
                    result will be publicly available. Details that will become 
                    public are clearly stated as 'public' in the enrolment process, 
                    Subscriber Agreement and associated schedules. </p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Product Download</span><br>
                    When downloading a Comodo product, such as the TrustToolbar 
                    Plug-in, you will be required to submit personal information 
                    as specified on the download page. This information will be 
                    used by Comodo to contact the customer about the services 
                    on our site for which they have expressed interest, including 
                    product updates and associated promotional material. It also 
                    aids Comodo in providing improved global services by collating 
                    general demographic information. Please refer to the opt-out 
                    policy described later in this policy statement.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Information Request</span><br>
                    Comodo provide the ability to request further information 
                    or ask questions to the support team by displaying email links 
                    throughout the website. If a customer elects to use such links 
                    they may be requested to provide additional information depending 
                    on the nature of the contact. Typically, such additional information 
                    may include further contact details, and in the case of technical 
                    support, additional information about the customer's PC configuration 
                    may be required to aid a prompt a accurate response to the 
                    query.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Cookies</span><br>
                    A cookie is a piece of data stored on a computer's hard disk 
                    containing information about the owner. At the time of publishing 
                    this statement Comodo do not employ the use of cookies. However, 
                    our partners may use cookies. Comodo do not exercise any access 
                    or control of such cookies.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Log Files</span><br>
                    Comodo use log files comprising of IP addresses to analyse 
                    trends, administer the site, track movements throughout the 
                    site, calculate the number of document and file downloads, 
                    and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 
                    IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Sharing</span><br>
                    Comodo will share aggregated demographic information with 
                    our partners. This is not linked to any personal information 
                    that can identify any individual person.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">External Links</span><br>
                    The Comodo website contains links to external websites. Comodo 
                    is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
                    sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
                    collected by this website. Comodo have no control over the 
                    accuracy of information displayed by such websites.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Security</span><br>
                    This website takes every precaution to protect our customer's 
                    information. When customers submit sensitive information via 
                    the website, such information is protected both online and 
                    off-line.</p>
                  <p>During certificate enrolment, where sensitive information 
                    is required, the transmission of information is encrypted 
                    and protected using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This includes 
                    the submission of any payment information such as credit card 
                    details.</p>
                  <p>Comodo use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
                    online and do everything in our power to protect user-information 
                    off-line. All of our customer's information, not just the 
                    sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our 
                    offices. Only employees who need the information to perform 
                    a specific job (for example billing administration or the 
                    development team) are granted access to personally identifiable 
                    information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers 
                    when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter 
                    their password to re-gain access to customer information. 
                    Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security 
                    and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time 
                    new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or 
                    reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what 
                    they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. 
                    The servers that we store personally identifiable information 
                    on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 
                    The cryptographic keys used to issue certificates are maintained 
                    in the secure environment of FIPS-140 level 4 accredited IBM 
                    4758 crypto devices.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Supplementation of Information (validation 
                    of submitted details)</span><br>
                    In order for Comodo to properly fulfil its obligation to our 
                    customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information 
                    we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>
                  <p>For example, prior to the issuance of some certificate types 
                    Comodo may use the WHOIS database, Government sourced companies 
                    house database or Dun &amp; Bradstreet company lookup information 
                    to validate the accuracy of supplied data. This is an integral 
                    aspect of the service provided by Comodo.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Service Updates</span><br>
                    Established customers will occasionally receive information 
                    on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out 
                    of respect for the privacy of our customers we present the 
                    option not to receive these types of communications. We also 
                    send the user service announcement updates. Customers are 
                    not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which 
                    may contain important security information about the service.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Updating Customer Information</span><br>
                    If a customer's personally identifiable information or certificate 
                    specific information changes they may update the original 
                    information provided. Changes can be made by logging into 
                    the Members area and using the services provided in the Manage 
                    Account section.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Choice / Opt out</span><br>
                    Customers are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having 
                    information used for purposes not directly related to the 
                    Comodo service offering at the point where the information 
                    is requested. For example, all certificate enrolment and product 
                    downloads has an 'opt-out' mechanism so customers who buy 
                    a product from us, but would prefer not to receive any marketing 
                    material, can request to have their email address kept off 
                    of our lists.</p>
                  <p>If customers no longer wish to receive our newsletter or 
                    promotional materials from our partners, they may opt-out 
                    of receiving these communications by emailing Comodo at webmaster@comodo.net. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Customers of our site are always notified when their information 
                    is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our 
                    customers can make an informed choice as to whether they should 
                    proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Certificate Revocation &amp; Expiry</span><br>
                    Access to all issued certificates is provided through the 
                    Comodo public repository. Because of the nature of the service 
                    provided, there may be circumstances under which a certificate 
                    is revoked (cancelled). Furthermore, as the lifetime of all 
                    certificates is finite (lasting usually 1 year), certificates 
                    will expire.</p>
                  <p>Comodo still provides public access to both revoked and expired 
                    certificates to ensure a party relying on the certificate 
                    may still be able to retrieve the certificate and verify a 
                    signature made with the certificate. Such certificates are 
                    flagged as revoked or expired within the repository.</p>
                  <p><span class="p4">Customer consent</span><br>
                    By using our Web site, customers consent to the collection 
                    and use of this information by Comodo Limited. If any subsequent 
                    changes are made to our privacy policy, we will post those 
                    changes on the policy update page so that customers are always 
                    aware of what information is collected, how it is used and 
                    under what circumstances it may be disclosed.</p>
