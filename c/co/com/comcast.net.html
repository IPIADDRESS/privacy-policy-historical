		<font class="blacktext">Comcast will use basic customer information from you to provide the Service. When you sign up for the Service, you are required to provide your name, address, telephone number and appropriate billing information. That information is available only to authorized Comcast personnel for installing, maintaining, and billing you for the Service.
		<br><br>Comcast will use information that you give us to offer a more customized online experience. For example, if you change your personal setting for the Service we can deliver local weather information on the home page as well as a home page of localized news or content tailored to interests that you specify.
        <br><br>Comcast will use information you provide to Comcast's support software to assist you with technical support for your use of the Service.  When you use the Comcast supplied support software on your desktop and forward a request for assistance or choose to chat with a technical support representative, the support software will record certain information relating to your request and interaction.  You have the choice to provide any information to the support software or a support representative, and you have the ability to confirm your decision before you send any information to our systems.  The information collected by the support software is limited to the hardware and software configurations of your computer system and to any email you send or discussion you type during a live support session.  This information is available only to authorized Comcast personnel for maintaining and supporting your use of the Service.  Comcast also provides customer contact and support pages on the Service that you can use to communicate with us about technical support.  Comcast will use the information you provide to us on these pages to support your use of the Service.
        <br><br>Comcast or third party content and commerce providers may send promotional email messages to specific groups of people based on our database of customer information (for example, customers living in a specific geographic area). However, when sending messages tailored to a specific group, the actual names and personal information about individual customers is not disclosed. While Comcast reserves the right to send out administrative mailings to all its customers (for example, changes in pricing or operating policies), you can advise us that you don't want to receive promotional mailings and we will honor that request.  Call 1-800-COMCAST to let us know that you don't want to receive promotional mailings.
        <br><br>Comcast or third party content and commerce providers may collect and use billing and shipping information when you purchase goods online. Billing and shipping information may include your name, email address, shipping address, and credit card information. This information is necessary to deliver the service or product to you. When you use a credit card, the basic payment information is transmitted to the appropriate financial institution for purposes of processing the transaction. If you are concerned about the reputation and trustworthiness of any third party content or commerce provider, we encourage you to check their privacy policies.
        <br><br>Comcast or third party content and commerce providers may use personal information if you participate in a contest. If you enter a contest, you may be required to provide information about how we can contact you. This information will be used to contact you if you win the contest, and aggregate information may be used for marketing or research purposes. However, like other information you provide to Comcast, personal details about you will not be shared with others or used to send you promotional email messages if you indicate you do not wish to receive them.
        <br><br>Comcast may share aggregate information such as the number of customers who match certain statistical profiles (e.g., the number of customers in various parts of the country). Comcast may from time to time share such aggregate information, or create reports for our advertisers based on aggregate information we collect, but we will not provide them with personal information unless we have received your consent first.
        <br><br>While it is our general policy to refuse to make personal information about you available to government entities in the absence of a legal requirement to do so, Comcast will release personal information if required to do so by a valid law enforcement request. Where we have a legal requirement to disclose personal information, we will notify you before providing the requested information if we are required to do so by law.
        <br><br>Comcast may also release personal information in accordance with our Acceptable Use Policy.
		<br><br><br>
		<font class="bluebold">What Comcast will not do with information about you</font>
		<br>Comcast will not share personal information with advertisers, content providers, other providers of unrelated services or other outsiders without your consent, unless we are required to do so in accordance with applicable law.
		<br><br>Comcast will not read your outgoing or incoming e-mail, private chat or instant messages. We do store e-mail messages on our computer systems for a brief period of time and could be required to disclose the messages along with personal information to comply with a valid law enforcement request or if we believe that a state of emergency exists where it is necessary to disclose this information to protect Comcast's property or an individual's safety or security.
        <br><br>Comcast will not send promotional email messages to you if you ask us not to do so. We do send promotional messages to our customers from time to time. However, we will stop sending you such messages if you advise us that you no longer wish to receive them.  Go to the Member Services page on the Service and change your user profile from the account management page.
		<br><br>Comcast will not share personal information about where you go on the Service or on the Web. We do, however, review this information in aggregate form to better understand how the Service is being used and to help us determine the popularity of our various Service features.
		<br><br>Comcast will not record any information that you provide to any Web site other than ones operated by Comcast. However, Comcast's Privacy Policy does not apply to Web sites operated by persons or organizations other than Comcast. You should review the privacy policy of the Web sites you visit to learn how they treat your personal information.
        <br><br>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), Comcast will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen without first obtaining parental consent. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. If applicable, Comcast will implement all of the applicable requirements of COPPA, including these related to parental notice, consent and access, in connection with the collection or use of personal information about children under the age of thirteen.</font></td>

        <font class="blacktext">In the online world, unsolicited junk mail is referred to as "spam." Nearly all of us at one time or another will find spam in our e-mail inboxes. Unfortunately, there is no current solution to completely prevent the delivery of spam. Spammers find your e-mail address in a number of ways. For example, you may have offered your e-mail address at a non Comcast Web site where you signed up for a product or service or maybe you posted a message to a discussion board and included your e-mail address. Some spammers may also send massive amounts of e-mail to various Internet domains simply based on large lists of possible names and e-mail addresses. This allows spammers to get mail out to people who have not provided their names or addresses. Your best bet is simply to delete the e-mail from your inbox.
        <br><br>Comcast is not responsible for spamming activity and cannot stop it from occurring, especially when it originates outside of our network domain. Comcast's Acceptable Use Policy prohibits use of the Service to deliver spam.</font></td>

        <font class="blacktext">Never provide any information to a Web site that doesn't post a privacy policy unless you have reason to trust that site.
        <br><br>Keep your passwords private. Children should be instructed not to give out their passwords to anyone other than their parents.
        <br><br>Never say anything in a public chat room or a forum (newsgroup) that you don't want the public to know about.  Be very cautious before posting your name, address, telephone number, place of work or any other information that could identify you. Information that you post in such areas can be seen by anyone and archived for use later on.
        <br><br>When shopping online, be sure you are dealing with reputable businesses who handle transactions securely before giving out credit card numbers or other personal information.
        <br><br>Instruct your children never to give out information about themselves without first checking with you.
