<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
</p>
<h3>The Information We Collect:
</h3><p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the CompaniesInTheUK.co.uk website. On some pages, you can purchase documents, monitor companies, or register with the website. The only personal information we collect is your email address so that we can send you the documents you purchase, or send you notification emails if your monitored companies change.
</p><p>For purchases we retain the transaction number that identifies your payment from our Credit Card agency or from PayPal depending on your payment method.  Using this transaction number we can obtain more information about you in exceptional circumstances, but this information is not collected, processed or stored by us.
</p><h3>The Way We Use Information:
</h3><p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 
</p><p>The documents that you purchase and the companies that you monitor are never shared with third parties.  This information is totally confidential between you and us.  If you monitor a company, then they will not know you are monitoring them.  If you purchase a document on a company, then that company will not know you have purchased the document on them.  Unless of course the company is our company, Comdevelopment Ltd!
</p><p>The one exception to this confidentiality is that if you purchase a document and you fail to pay for the document after we have supplied it, then we will share your email address with our debt collection agency and will publish whatever information we can obtain to help recover the debt. 
</p><p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.  For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
</p><h3>Our Commitment To Data Security
</h3><p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
</p><h3>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
</h3><p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by registering on the website using your email address.  Once registered go to 'Your Account' page, from this page you can see all your purchases and companies that you monitor.  We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
</p><p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information directly online at the 'Your Account' page.
</p><p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
