How GrowthOps uses the Personal Information it collects about you</h2><p>GrowthOps uses the Personal Information it collects about you for our business functions and activities, which may include the following:</p><p>to provide you with information, products or services you have requested;

to personalise and customise your experiences on our Website;

if you are a shareholder or apply to become a shareholder, to process your application, service your needs as a shareholder, provide facilities or services that you request, and administer your shareholding; and
for any other purpose communicated to you at the time that the Personal Information was collected or for which you provided your consent.
GrowthOps may use your Personal Information for a secondary purpose if that secondary purpose is related to those purposes in clause 1, if we have your consent or if otherwise provided for under the Privacy Act.</p><p>GrowthOps may use your Personal Information to provide you with direct, targeted, or other marketing materials on an ongoing basis. GrowthOps may provide you with these materials by telephone, electronic messages (e.g. email), our digital services and other means.  GrowthOps will only provide you with direct marketing materials where you would reasonably expect us to, or if you consent to receive direct marketing materials. We will seek your consent to provide you with direct marketing materials if we have obtained your Personal Information from a third party. Direct marketing communications may include promotional material about GrowthOps or may relate to the products and services GrowthOps, and our related entities, provide and other products and services which may be of interest to you.</p><p>You may opt out of receiving direct marketing material by contacting us in any of the ways specified in the direct marketing materials or as set out in clause 14.

Disclosure of your Personal Information overseas</h2><p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed outside of Australia to an entity in a foreign country, including entities in which GrowthOps has an ownership interest or to a service provider in the business of providing data storage and processing services (which commonly involve diverse geographic locations which change from time to time, which means it is not practical for us to notify you of which country your Personal Information may be located in). It is possible that entities with whom we share your information outside Australia may be subject to foreign laws that do not provide the same level of protection of Personal Information as in Australia.</p><p>By providing your Personal Information, you acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with the disclosure of your Personal Information overseas and expressly consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information to an overseas entity.</p><h2>9. Employee records</h2><p>Employee records are not generally subject to the Privacy Act.  As such this policy may not apply to the handling of officer, employee, contractor or consultant information.

If you wish to have your Personal Information destroyed or de-identified, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to do so (unless we need to keep it for legal, auditing or internal risk management reasons).</p><h2>13. Finding out what Personal Information GrowthOps holds about you</h2><p>You are entitled to access Personal Information that GrowthOps holds about you. If you request access to your Personal Information, we will grant your request unless providing you with access would unreasonably impact upon the privacy of others or is not otherwise permitted under the Australian Privacy Principles or at law.
