<div id="article2">
<h4>Welcome to Common Sense Media</h4>
<p>We do not share, sell or rent any personal information (i.e. name or contact information) voluntarily or involuntarily disclosed by visitors of this site with anyone for any reason, except in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you feel that this Website is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact us by email at <a href="#privacy[at]commonsensemedia[dot]org">privacy[at]commonsensemedia[dot]org</a>. Should this policy change, we will post a notice on our site.
</p>
<h4>Information We Collect and How We Use It </h4>
<p>
Because we respect your privacy, we want to disclose to you how we use the information that you provide to us online. Following is a list of the kinds of information we collect on our site, and how we use that information.
</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies let our website "remember" information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our website and use our services without having to login every time you visit the web site. We do not use cookies to store personal information about our users. </p>
<h4>Log Files and Electronic Footprints</h4>
<p>When you are viewing the different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our computer to identify your computer using its IP address. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any personal information.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>We encourage users of the site to become registered members of Common Sense Media. As a member, you will have access to certain areas of the site including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rating media and writing reviews</li>
<li>Writing media producers <em>(only available to members 13 years of age and older)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On the registration page we ask for the following pieces of information:</p>
<p><strong>Screen Name (Sign In Name) and Password</strong> -- The screen name and password you choose should be a something that is known only to you. We suggest that you NOT use your real name for your screen name or your password to protect your privacy. The password you choose is case-sensitive and should be under 20 characters. All passwords are encrypted, so we will not know the password that you have entered. If you write a review, your screen name will be displayed with your review, although you will have the option to remain anonymous with each review in which case we will not display your screen name with your review.</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong> -- We use your age to see how many people in your age group are using the site. We also display the age of a reviewer from individuals who are 17 years of age and younger (these reviews are displayed as "kids" on our website) along with the content of the review.</p>
<p><strong>Password Hint Question and Answer</strong> -- We use this information in case you have registered and then at a later date forget your password. You can then click the "forgot password" link, enter your zip code and Screen Name, and the Web site will assign you a new, random and encrypted password that you can then edit to anything you would like on your profile page</p>
<p><strong>Zip Code</strong> -- We use this information to understand the demographics of our visitors.</p>
<h4>The following information is only collected from individuals 13 years of age and older:</h4>
<p><strong>Email Address</strong> -- We use your email address to send you our weekly Newsletters and other emails about our organization, mission and advocacy goals. If you do not want to receive our weekly Newsletters you have the option to decline to be added to the Newsletter distribution list. Common Sense Media may also contact you with special Common Sense Media mission-related e-mails. These correspondence emails are separate from our weekly Newsletters. You can unsubscribe from these newsletters by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of every email.</p> 
<p><strong>First Name</strong> -- We collect your name (optional) so we can have a complete list of the users of our website and so we can personalize the email newsletters that we send to you.  </p>
<p><strong>Number of Kids</strong> -- We use this information to better understand the users of our site.
</p>
<h4>Weekly Newsletter</h4>
<p>When you register on our site you have the option to sign-up for our weekly newsletter. If you chose to subscribe to this weekly newsletter you will receive your first edition within the first week of your registration. We generally send the weekly newsletter on Fridays although may send on alternate days as well.</p>
<p>If you sign up to receive our weekly newsletter and later want to be removed from this distribution list, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of any newsletter. You can also unsubscribe from our weekly newsletter by sending us an email at <a href="#privacy[at]commonsensemedia[dot]org">privacy[at]commonsensemedia[dot]org</a> and include the email address that you would like to be unsubscribed. You can also unsubscribe by visiting your profile page and unchecking "unsubscribe" next to the weekly newsletter option.</p>
<h4>Limited Disclosure</h4>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to release information contained within our records concerning any visitor in order to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement individuals or entities, and to release information relating to such suspected illegal activity.

</p>
<h4>Content and Ratings</h4>
<p>You can publish on our website your reviews, comments and ratings on different media types (movies, books, etc.) by clicking on the "rate it" button located on any review page. The content of your review and ratings will be displayed on our website along with your screen name (unless you choose to remain anonymous) and other demographic information that you provided in your profile (i.e. city and state and, if 17 or younger, age). Submitted reviews that do not follow our <a href="/about_us/terms_of_use.php">Terms of Use</a> will not be published. We may also promote the most popular or highest-earning reviews and display segments of your review in feature areas of the website. In accordance with our <a href="/about_us/terms_of_use.php">Terms of Use</a>, you agree that Common Sense Media will be the owner of all user content submitted to the website. </p>

We will notify you when your review has been deleted from our website. You do not need to be a registered member to read these user reviews. </p>

If you decide that you would no longer like to be a member of Common Sense Media and you would like your personal information deleted from our database, please send an email to <a href="#privacy[at]commonsensemedia[dot]org">privacy[at]commonsensemedia[dot]org</a> and include your screen name and email address.</p>
