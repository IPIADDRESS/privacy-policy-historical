In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if we have to take this course of action.</p>
<h2>3. How Is Your Personal Data Collected?</h2>

<h2>4. How Do We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>To respond to your inquiries or to process your requests (such as to receive promotional materials)</li>

<li>To deliver relevant website content to you</li>
<li>To deliver marketing communications to you and measure or understand the effectiveness of these we serve to you</li>
<li>To offer Aptean products and services to you, whether directly or indirectly;</li>
<li>To use data analytics to improve our website, products/services, marketing, customer relationships and experiences</li>
<li>To enable you to partake in a prize draw, competition or complete a survey</li>

<li>If Aptean or one of its affiliates is sold (either through a merger into another entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the selling entity), we may disclose your personal information to the prospective buyer because personal information about the selling entity’s customers is typically one of the assets that is transferred to the buyer.</li>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p>
<h3>Promotional Offers From Us</h3>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>Prospective customers may receive marketing and other communications from us if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>requested information from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing; and</li>
<li>consented in advance, to us providing you, and/or permitted selected third parties to providing you, with information about products, services, promotions or events that may interest you. Where you have consented, Aptean and these selected third parties may contact you by telephone, mail or by other means for these purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Existing customers may receive marketing and other communications from us provided you have not opted out of receiving those communications.</p>
<h3>Opting Out</h3>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by <a href="http://lp.aptean.com/Preferences-New.html">Contacting us</a> at any time. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our cookie section above.</p>
<h3>Legal Bases For Processing</h3>
<p>We have set out below a description of some of the legal bases we rely on to process your personal data. Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please email: <a href="mailto:dpo@aptean.com">dpo@aptean.com</a> or write to the Data Protection Officer, 7 Rushmills, Northampton, NN4 7YB, UK if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. The following are non-exhaustive examples of where Aptean relies on legitimate interest to process personal data:</li>
<ul>
<li>Aptean has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows us to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate's suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job; and</li>
<li>Aptean has a legitimate interest in processing personal data relating to our existing customers in order to manage our business relationship and provide communications and information that may be of interest.</li>
<li>Aptean has a legitimate interest in using cookies as outlined above in the cookie section of this privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to prospective customers.</p>
<h3>Change Of Purpose</h3>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email: <a href="mailto:dpo@aptean.com">dpo@aptean.com</a> or write to the Data Protection Officer, 7 Rushmills, Northampton, NN4 7YB, UK.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2>5. Who Do We Disclose Your Personal Data To</h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below where they are involved in providing services to us. We will only share personal information about you that is reasonably necessary for the other companies to have in order to provide their services to Aptean. These companies are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have engaged them to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Aptean primarily stores the personal data we collect in the United States. To facilitate Aptean’s global operations, staff who work for Aptean and/or our service providers may transfer and access such personal data from locations around the world. This will involve transferring your personal data outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>).</p>
<p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will ensure one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
<li>We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
<li>We will ensure there is some other protection in place which has been approved by the European Commission as giving personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards that are designed to protect your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Employees who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting our DPO at <a href="mailto:dpo@aptean.com">dpo@aptean.com</a> or by writing to The Data Protection Officer, Aptean Limited, 7 Rushmills, Northampton, NN4 7YB, UK.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<h2>9. Your Legal Rights</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data as set out below:</p>
<p><strong>Request</strong> <strong>access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@aptean.com">dpo@aptean.com</a> or write to: The Data Protection Officer, Aptean Limited, 7 Rushmills, Northampton, NN4 7YB, UK.</p>
<h3>No Fee Usually Required</h3>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<h3>What We May Need from You</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<h3>Time Limit To Respond</h3>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
