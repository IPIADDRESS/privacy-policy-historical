For example, Comantra may share personal information with third parties to send marketing communications; service products; conduct research, analysis or administer surveys; send mail and e-mail; process credit card payments, data storage, and hosting services.

The third parties with whom Comantra conducts business are only authorized to use your information to perform the service for which they were hired.

From time to time, we may be required to share personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful.

In certain areas of Comantra's website, Comantra uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. While Comantra strives to protect your Personal Information, Comantra cannot guarantee the security of the Personal Information, so Comantra urges you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

This lets us access your computer to determine the problem and either repair it or provide advice on possible repair options. By taking advantage of this service, you give permission to a Comantra Agent to log into your computer, which may contain personal information. He or she will only search your computer to determine the cause of the problem and will attempt to minimize interaction with your data.

<p align="justify" class="operating_text6 style12">A cookie is a small data file that a Web site or e-mail may send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Comantra e-mails and Web sites may use cookies to create a more personalized user experience for visitors. These simulate a continuous connection, letting us remember information about your preferences and session. Comantra uses a third party to place cookies on your computer. Although these may contain a unique user ID, they do not collect or store any identifiable personal information. The Comantra web server automatically collects click stream information such as the address (URL) of the Web site that you came from before visiting COMANTRA.NET, which pages you visit on our site while you’re there, which browser you used to view our site, and any search terms you may have entered, among other things. COMANTRA.NET may also use anonymous click stream data to track which pages visitors view. This helps us understand how visitors use our sites.</p>

Member account, password and security:</span> <span class="style12">If any of the Services requires you to open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the applicable registration form. You also will choose a password and a user name. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify Comantra immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Comantra will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by Comantra or another party due to someone else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else's account at any time, without the permission of the account holder.
  We prefer to keep your personal information accurate and up-to-date. To do this, we provide you with the opportunity to update or modify your personal information including billing and shipping information by logging into your account.<br>
  
  When you create or change your account, we will send a message to the email address confirming the changes made and options you have chosen. Comantra periodically distributes an e-mail newsletter, and you choose whether you want to receive a newsletter from us when you create your account. If you later decide not to receive the newsletter, you can remove yourself from the mailing list at any time.</span></p>

Since the "forgot my password" feature sends your password to the email address that you used for registration, do not use an email address that can be accessed by others that you would not want to see or change your Comantra account information.<br>
  
  Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself or your children in any Communication Services. Comantra does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Services and, therefore, Comantra specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Services.
