        <p>This Privacy Policy will provide information to you regarding how we collect and use your personal information, and about choices you have concerning our use of such information.

        <p><b>Scope of Privacy Policy</b><br>
        This Privacy Policy applies to Comcastoffers.com's method of collection and use of information gathered by us for the customers that we serve on http://www.comcastoffers.com (the "Web Site"). However, please note that the privacy practices of Comcast Corporation are not covered by this Privacy Policy. In addition, once you leave our Web Site via a link or otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply and Comcastoffers.com is not responsible for how data and information obtained from you on other Web sites is used by the operators of such Web sites.</p>

        <p><b>Security</b><br>
        We believe that protecting the security of your Personal Information is very important. Therefore, we have put strong security measures in place to attempt to protect your Personal Information. Access to Personal Information is limited to Comcastoffers.com employees or other authorized individuals, and a limited number of our fulfillment partners.  Identities are verified by internal network access rules and application username/password pairs. Data fields that identify individuals are separated from non-sensitive data fields. Data identifying Personal Information is encrypted through use of industry-standard AES encryption methods and practices. Data decryption keys are kept physically separate from encryption keys and encrypted data. Records are marked with tamper-proof authentication digests.</p>
        <p>Comcastoffers.com requires internal users to use Comcastoffers.com's standardized methods of data transfer, encryption and storage. We encourage external parties, service providers and vendors to use our standardized methods of data transfer, encryption and storage, or an equivalent method.</p>
        <p>We also monitor hardware and software logs for operational compliance with security policies. Comcastoffers.com quarantines data that arrives on a channel not approved in the policy until its source and disposition can be determined in accordance with the security policy. Consequences of non-compliance range from delay in reporting response times to refusal to accept or verify data, in accordance with penalties specified by contract. </p>
        <p>Barriers erected to prevent potential breaches of secure information include a sophisticated security system, internal audits, internal policies/procedures and a daily backup of all information.  The Director of Technology is responsible for all aspects of secure information within Comcastoffers.com.</p>
        <p>No service provider/vendor/external party should be able to decrypt the encrypted data of any other service provider/vendor/external party should data be misdelivered.</p>

        <p><b>Enforcement</b><br>
        Comcastoffers.com monitors data center metrics on approximately a weekly basis. Network vulnerability testing and standard NOC monitoring are provided by the data center administration staff, with options for performing third-party security audits on demand.</p>
	      <p>Comcastoffers.com performs full recovery tests prior to live deployment of a new application or server system. Comcastoffers.com performs recovery tests of backup media on a monthly to quarterly schedule to assure that existing backup regimes have created working recovery sets.</p>
        <p>Comcastoffers.com actively monitors current and upcoming regulatory and compliance issues through outside legal resources.</p>

Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our Web site. </p>
