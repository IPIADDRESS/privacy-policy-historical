<i>Last Revised: March 23, 2014</i></p>
<p>Come2Play Ltd. its subsidiaries and affiliates (<b>“Come2Play”</b>, <b>“Company”</b>, <b>“we”</b> or <b>“us”</b>) respect the privacy of the users of its online games available through our website at [http://www.come2play.com/Default.aspx] (the <b>“Site”</b>) as well as through websites of third parties engaged with us (the <b>“Publisher Website”</b> or <b>“Publisher”</b>), the Facebook platform and/or as installable mobile applications for iOS/Android/Kindle (the <b>“Services”</b>, as further defined in our TOS) (<b>“User”</b> or <b>“you”</b>) and is committed to protect the personal information that its Users share with it. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you use our Services. Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Service at [http://www.come2play.com/terms_of_service.asp] (<b>“TOS”</b>), into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated thereto by reference</p>
<ol class="topic">
<li>
<h4>Your Consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)</h4>
<p>BY CONNECTING TO, USING, PARTICIPATING IN, ACCESSING AND/OR PLAYING OUR GAMES AND/OR INSTALLING OUR APPS ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, AND/OR BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT AND/OR BY ENTERING INTO, CONNECTING TO, USING OUR SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (THE “PRIVACY POLICY”), INCLUDING TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED BELOW). IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THE APPS, DO NOT CONNECT TO, ACCESS OR USE ANY OF THE APPS, GAMES AND SITE, PROMPTLY ERASE ALL COME2PLAY APPS FROM YOUR MOBILE DEVICE AND PERSONAL COMPUTER AND DO NOT ENTER TO, CONNECT TO, ACCESS OR USE ANY OF OUR SERVICES</p>
<p><b>Note that if you are playing our Games on one of our Publisher Websites, we recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policy of such Publisher with whom you are interacting before doing so. Their privacy policy and terms of use, not ours, will apply to any of those interactions</b></p></li>
<li>
<h4>Which information we may collect on our Users?</h4>
<p>We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (<b>“Non-personal Information”</b>). <b>We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected the Non-personal Information</b>. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Services. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information, which may contain, among other things, type of operating system, type of browser and keyboard language, computer configurations settings and any similar technical data, etc. In addition the Company collects behavioral information, which may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the Services (which Game was played, when, with whom, Game results, amount of Virtual Items purchased and/or “earned”, time and length of Game play etc.), User’s ‘click-stream’ on the Services, etc.</li>
<li>The second type of information is individually identifiable information (<b>“Personal Information”</b>). <b>This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.</b></li>
<li>Users of the Services automatically provide their IP address mainly for enhancing the User’s experience and for geolocation (i.e., Country) and security purposes as further detailed below. If you play our Games on your mobile device, we collect your mobile device identifier.</li>
<li>In addition, Personal Information which is being gathered consists of any personal details provided consciously and voluntarily by the User. The Personal Information is collected from the details the User provides when registering to the Site or to any Publisher Website, which may include, the User’s nick name, e-mail address, password and gender.</li>
<li>Alternatively, Users can open an Account and signup to the Services via existing third party accounts (namely, Facebook account) used by the User (<b>“Facebook Connect”</b>). In the event that a User uses Facebook Connect, then Facebook provides us, per our request, with certain information about such User as is stored in such third-party account, namely, your Basic Information (nickname, full name, profile picture, gender, user ID, date of birth, list of friends and any other information the User made public) and game activity. Nevertheless, we DO NOT keep all of this information. We only store in our databases the following: profile picture, full name and e-mail address (to the extent that your e-mail address is set as ‘public”). All other User information provided via the third party website is promptly deleted.</li>
<li>In the event that the User would like to send us Feedback regarding the Services, the User will be required to provide Come2Play with the User’s e-mail address.</li>
<li>Please note: By playing a Game through the Facebook platform, you are authorizing Come2Play to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed that Facebook could provide to Come2Play through the Facebook Application Programming Interface (<b>“API”</b>) as well as you Facebook User ID.</li>
<li>In the event that you use our Games via Facebook Connect or within the Facebook platform then you hereby grant Come2Play permission to post on your behalf on your personal Facebook Timeline. However, you may stop this at any time by changing your settings in your Facebook account.</li>
<li><u>Please note:</u> By playing a Game through the Publisher Website, you are authorizing Come2Play to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed that such Publisher could provide to Come2Play in accordance with such Publisher privacy policy and terms of use, as well as your persistent identifier within such Publisher Website.</li>
</ol>
