      <p><b> 
        HOW WE HANDLE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
      <p>Personal information is information or opinion that allows 
        others to identify you. It includes your name, age, gender, contact details, 
        as well as your health and financial information. We are part of the part 
        of the Commonwealth Bank Group. We will act to protect your personal information 
        in accordance with the National Privacy Principles or an industry privacy 
        code.</p>
      <p>The Group is a collection of related organisations that 
        provide banking, insurance, funds management, financial planning and advice, 
        superannuation, stockbroking, and finance services. </p>
      <p>We value your trust, and aim to help you manage and build 
        wealth over a long period. The protection of your personal information 
        is a vital part of this relationship. It is supported by our long experience 
        of keeping personal information confidential.</p>
      <p>We collect personal information to provide you with the 
        products and services you request as well as information on other products 
        and services offered by us. The law may also require us to collect personal 
        information. We will tell you who collects the personal information, advise 
        you of their contact details, your right of access to that information, 
        and what will happen if you choose not to provide the information. </p>
      <p>Personal information may be used and disclosed within 
        the Group to administer our products and services, as well as for prudential 
        and risk management purposes and, unless you tell us otherwise, to provide 
        you with related marketing information . We also use the information we 
        hold to help detect and prevent illegal activity. We co-operate with police 
        and other enforcement bodies as required or allowed by law.</p>
      <p>We disclose relevant personal information to external 
        organisations that help us provide services. These organisations are bound 
        by confidentiality arrangements. They may include overseas organisations. 
        </p>
      <p>You can seek access 
        to the personal information we hold about you. If the information we hold 
        about you is inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated, please inform us so 
        that we can correct it. If we deny access to your personal information, 
        we will let you know why. For example, we may give an explanation of a 
        commercially-sensitive decision, rather than direct access to evaluative 
        information connected with it.</p>

        </a>BACKGROUND </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Common law 
        duty of confidentiality</strong></p>
      <p>As part of the general law governing the banker/customer 
        contract, banks have always been required to keep any information about 
        their customers in the strictest confidence. Traditionally, banks could 
        only disclose information they hold about a customer if:<br>
        • they had the customer's express or implied consent;<br>
        • the disclosure was compelled by law; for example, under Taxation 
        Acts;<br>
        • the disclosure was required in the best interests of the bank; 
        for example, to a court if a bank is defending or conducting legal action 
        involving a customer. This exception does not, as it is sometimes thought, 
        allow a bank to disclose information for any purpose it chooses; or<br>
        • the disclosure was in the public interest; for example, if a customer's 
        dealings indicate that he or she was trading with the enemy during a time 
        of war. This exception is used rarely and only in the most serious circumstances.</p>
      <p>As a matter of policy, all members of the Commonwealth 
        Bank Group observed this standard of confidentiality. Whilst these general 
        requirements remain in place for banks, all members of the Commonwealth 
        Bank Group now have broader obligations, under the National Privacy Principles, 
        which are contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cwth).</p>
      <p><strong>Privacy Act 
        1988</strong></p>
      <p>The Commonwealth Government has enacted privacy legislation 
        to protect information held by all credit providers (not just banks) about 
        their customers' personal credit dealings. Since 1991, under Part IIIA 
        of the Privacy Act, credit providers (that includes the Commonwealth Bank) 
        have only been allowed to disclose information about personal credit dealings 
        to certain classes of persons (such as another bank or a credit union) 
        for certain very limited purposes. </p>
      <p><strong>Privacy Amendment 
        (Private Sector) Act 2000</strong></p>
      <p>In December 2000, the Commonwealth Government enacted 
        further privacy legislation, which commenced 21 December 2001, amending 
        the Privacy Act (implementing the National Privacy Principles) to include 
        provisions that regulate the way private sector organisations collect, 
        use, disclose, keep secure and provide access to personal information. 
        </p>
      <p>The Commonwealth Bank Group acts to protect your personal 
        information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>This document</strong></p>
      <p>The information in 
        this document details how we comply with the requirements of the Privacy 
        Act in protecting the personal information we hold about you.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        <a name="collection"></a>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong> 
        </p>
      <p><strong>What is "personal 
        information"?</strong></p>
      <p>Personal information is information 
        or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material 
        form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably 
        be ascertained, from the information or opinion.</p>
      <p><strong>Why we collect 
        information</strong></p>
      <p>Personal information is collected 
        so that we may:</p>
      <p>• administer our customer 
        relationships;<br>
        • provide customers with the products and services they request 
        and, unless they tell us otherwise, to provide information on products 
        offered by the collecting member and other members of the Commonwealth 
        Bank Group.</p>
      <p>Personal information may also 
        be used for:</p>
      <p>• monitoring and evaluating 
        products and services;<br>
        • gathering and aggregating information for statistical, prudential, 
        actuarial and research purposes;<br>
        • assisting customers with queries; and<br>
        • taking measures to detect and prevent frauds and credit loss.</p>
      <p><strong>What we collect</strong></p>
      <p>Personal information collected 
        by members of the Commonwealth Bank Group generally comprises name, address, 
        date of birth, gender, marital status, occupation, account details, contact 
        details (including telephone, facsimile and e-mail) and financial information. 
        Sometimes we collect a few personal details unlikely to be known to other 
        people to help us identify you over the telephone.</p>
      <p>If you are applying for credit 
        we may also collect the number and ages of your dependants, the length 
        of time at your current address, your employer's name and contact details, 
        the length of your employment, proof of earnings and, if you have changed 
        employer in the last few years, details of your previous employment. We 
        use this information to assist in making responsible credit decisions. 
        In addition, as required by Part IIIA of the Privacy Act 1988, we will 
        obtain your consent to collect, use and disclose credit information about 
        you.</p>
      <p>If you have or are applying 
        for life insurance or income protection insurance, we also collect medical 
        and lifestyle information that relates to the insurance. This information 
        may include your sexual activity and is collected so we may assess whether 
        to accept your insurance proposal and, if so, on what terms.</p>
      <p>If you are applying to join 
        an affinity (professional associations and organisations) program, we 
        will collect information regarding your membership of the relevant body 
        so that we may confirm your eligibility to participate.</p>
      <p>We are required by law to identify 
        you if you are opening a new account or adding a new signatory to an existing 
        account. The Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 requires us to sight 
        and record details of certain documents (for example, birth certificate, 
        passport) in order to achieve 100 points of identification.</p>
      <p>Where it is necessary to do 
        so, we also collect information on individuals such as company directors 
        and officers (where the company is our customer) as well as customers' 
        agents and persons dealing with us on a 'one-off' basis.</p>
      <p>We may take steps to verify 
        the information we collect; for example, a birth certificate provided 
        as identification may be verified with records held by the Registry of 
        Births, Deaths and Marriages to protect against impersonation, or we may 
        verify with an employer that employment and remuneration information provided 
        in an application for credit is accurate.</p>
      <p>We do not collect information 
        about your political or religious beliefs, or ethnic background.</p>
      <p><strong>What if you 
        provide incomplete or inaccurate information?</strong></p>
      <p>We may not be able to provide 
        you with the products or services you are seeking.</p>
      <p><strong>Obtaining 
        your consent</strong></p>
      <p>In most cases, before or at 
        the time of taking out a new product from a member of the Commonwealth 
        Bank Group (or, if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable thereafter) 
        the collecting member obtains your consent to the purposes for which it 
        intends to use and disclose your personal information. </p>
      <p>If you do not give us consent, 
        we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you want. 
        This is because it is impracticable for us to treat some customers differently 
        because, for example, they don't want their statements to be prepared 
        and mailed by an external provider we have made arrangements with to provide 
        this service to all customers. </p>
      <p>Please refer to the "Other 
        Disclosures" section for details of the confidentiality arrangements 
        that apply when functions are outsourced.</p>
      <p><strong>Withdrawing 
        consent</strong></p>
      <p>Having provided consent, you 
        are able to withdraw it at any time. To withdraw consent, please contact 
        the member of the Commonwealth Bank Group from whom consent is to be withdrawn. 
        Please note that withdrawing your consent may lead to the Group member 
        no longer being able to provide you with the product or service you enjoy 
        given that, as mentioned above, it is impracticable for us to treat some 
        customers differently.</p>
      <p><strong>Information 
        collected from someone else</strong></p>
      <p>In some cases, your personal 
        information may be provided to us by agents, or by family members or friends. 
        We will take reasonable steps to let you know that we have your personal 
        information, unless it is obvious from the circumstances that you know 
        or would expect us to have the information, such as where a broker is 
        acting on your behalf. Reasonable steps may include asking the person 
        who gave us your information to let you know that we have that information.</p>
      <p><strong>Collection 
        from young people</strong></p>
      <p>Requests from young people 
        (those under 16 years of age) to open bank accounts are normally satisfied 
        by opening specially designed accounts. These accounts are opened in the 
        name of the young person, although a parent or guardian's personal information 
        is also collected. The parent or guardian is the authorised signatory 
        who operates the account, and who provides the consent to the use and 
        disclosure of personal information.</p>
      <p>A direct request from 
        a young person to open or operate an account or to acquire other products 
        or services from the Commonwealth Bank Group in his/her own name is considered 
        on its merits.</p>

        <a name="other"></a>OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH BANK GROUP</strong></p>
      <p>Members of the Commonwealth

        Any such disclosure is controlled by the Privacy Act, and members of the

        of the Group may not use or disclose your personal information for purposes

      <p><strong>Who we may 
        communicate with</strong></p>
      <p>Depending on the product or 
        service you have and the member of the Group you are dealing with, we 
        may exchange personal information with:</p>
      <p>• brokers and agents 
        who refer your business to us;<br>
        • valuers and insurers if you are borrowing from us to purchase 
        property (so that we can obtain a valuation of your property, and confirm 
        that it is insured) ;<br>
        • external product providers for whom we act as agent (so that they 
        may provide you with the product you seek);<br>
        • auditors we appoint to ensure the integrity of our operations;<br>
        • auctioneers (if we have to sell a property we hold as security 
        to recover moneys owing to us);<br>
        • real estate agents (to confirm details of a property you are purchasing 
        or if we have to sell a property we hold as security. We will not, however, 
        without your specific written permission, confirm to real estate agents 
        the outcome of your application for finance);<br>
        • lenders' mortgage insurers (if we have to take out insurance because 
        of the amount you are borrowing exceeds a certain percentage of the property's 
        value)<br>
        (Note that mortgage insurers may also use and disclose personal information 
        in accordance with the National Privacy Principles for their own purposes, 
        which may include disclosure to credit reporting agencies, service providers 
        and reinsurers. They will not, however, use your personal information 
        for marketing purposes.);<br>
        • any person acting on your behalf, including your financial adviser, 
        solicitor and accountant; executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or 
        attorney;<br>
        • your referee (to confirm details about you);<br>
        • if required or authorised to do so, regulatory bodies and government 
        agencies ;<br>
        • credit reporting agencies (see the section "Exchanging information 
        with a credit reporting agency" on page 11);<br>
        • insurers, including proposed insurers and insurance reference 
        agencies (where we are considering whether to accept a proposal of insurance 
        from you and, if so, on what terms);<br>
        • claims assessors and investigators, claims managers, builders, 
        architects and engineers, and reinsurers (so that your claim can be assessed 
        and managed);<br>
        • medical practitioners (to verify or clarify, if necessary, any 
        health information you may provide);<br>
        • other financial institutions and organisations at their request 
        if you seek credit from them (so that they may assess whether to offer 
        you credit);<br>
        • suppliers from whom we order goods on your behalf (so that the 
        goods may be provided to you);<br>
        • agents who assist us to dispose of property or equipment, such 
        as at the end of a financing arrangement (so that the property or equipment 
        may be disposed);<br>
        • investors, advisers, trustees and ratings agencies where credit 
        facilities and receivables are pooled and sold (securitised) (see the 
        section "Securitisation" on page 12);<br>
        • other organisations who in conjunction with us provide products 
        and services (so that they may provide their products and services to 
        you); and<br>
        • professional associations or organisations with whom we conduct 
        an affinity relationship (to verify your membership of those associations 
        or organisations).<br>
        • Share Registries and the Stockbrokers Mutual Reference Society.</p>
      <p>If we have used an example 
        to indicate when we might exchange personal information, the exchange 
        of personal information may not be limited to those examples or examples 
        of a similar kind.</p>
      <p><strong>Outsourcing</strong></p>
      <p>We disclose personal information 
        when we outsource certain functions, including bulk mailing, card and 
        cheque book production, market research, direct marketing, statement production, 
        debt recovery and information technology support. We also seek expert 
        help from time to time to help us improve our systems, products and services.</p>
      <p>We use banking agents, for 
        example, local businesses, to help provide you with face-to-face banking 
        services. These agents collect personal information on our behalf.</p>
      <p>In all circumstances where 
        personal information may become known to our contractors, agents and outsourced 
        service providers, there are confidentiality arrangements in place. Contractors, 
        agents and outsourced service providers are not able to use or disclose 
        personal information for any purposes other than our own. </p>
      <p>The exception is Woolworths 
        Ezy Banking, a joint initiative of Woolworths Limited ABN 88 000 014 675 
        and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ABN 48 123 123 124, where information 
        is shared with and used by Woolworths Limited with the consent of the 
        Woolworths Ezy Banking customer.</p>
      <p>The Commonwealth Bank 
        Group takes its obligations to protect customer information very seriously 
        and we make every effort to deal only with parties who share and demonstrate 
        the same attitude.</p>
      <p><strong>Sending personal 
        information overseas</strong></p>
      <p>We send personal information 
        overseas if we outsource functions using overseas agents or contractors, 
        or to complete a particular transaction, such as an International Money 
        Transfer.</p>
      <p><strong>Exchanging 
        information with a credit reporting agency</strong></p>
      <p>When you apply for credit we 
        need to be in a position to decide whether or not you are likely to repay. 
        Our decision will be based on your current financial position (including 
        your other credit repayments) and on your credit history (whether in the 
        past you have been a reliable repayer). We will consider the information 
        you give us when you fill out your application and may check that information 
        with a credit reporting agency and with any other credit provider with 
        whom you have had dealings.</p>
      <p>In checking with a credit reporting 
        agency, we are looking to confirm the completeness and accuracy of information 
        you have provided on your application form. This helps you as well as 
        us because we do not want to give you further credit if, given your existing 
        borrowings, you will have difficulty making repayments.</p>
      <p>Where the Privacy Act applies 
        we can only give information about you to a credit reporting agency if 
        we first have told you that we will do so, and we can only obtain information 
        about you from a credit reporting agency if we have your consent.</p>
      <p>You may obtain a copy of credit 
        reports about you. Please refer to page 15 for details of how to do this.</p>
      <p><strong>Disclosure 
        required by law</strong></p>
      <p>We may be required by law to 
        disclose information, for example, when we are served with a court order. 
        We may also be required by a Government Agency to produce information 
        and records, for example, pursuant to taxation or social security laws.</p>
      <p><strong>Disclosure 
        as a result of your actions</strong></p>
      <p>There may be circumstances 
        in which we consider you, by your actions, to have released us from our 
        duty of confidentiality or to have consented to the disclosure of information 
        about you without actually saying so (for example, if you discuss your 
        financial position publicly to the media, in such a way as to leave us 
        with little alternative but to respond publicly).</p>
      <p><strong>Securitisation</strong></p>
      <p>Securitisation involves 
        the pooling of assets (such as loans) of a similar kind and the sale of 
        the pooled assets to a special purpose vehicle. To facilitate the process, 
        we may disclose personal information to any person to whom our rights 
        in the assets are to pass or proposed to pass and to any ratings agencies, 
        trustees, investors and advisors involved in the transaction. </p>
      <p> <strong><br>
        <a name="personal"></a>PERSONAL INFORMATION QUALITY</strong></p>
      <p>Our goal is to ensure that 
        the personal information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 
        Please contact us if any of the details you have provided change. Please 
        also contact us if you believe that the information we have about you 
        is not accurate, complete or up-to-date.</p>
      <p>We may take steps 
        to update personal information, for example, an address, by collecting 
        personal information from publicly available sources, for example, telephone 
        directories or electoral rolls.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        <a name="security"></a>PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></p>
      <p>We are committed to keeping 
        secure the personal information you provide to us. We take all reasonable 
        precautions to protect the personal information we hold about you from 
        misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
      <p>We have a range of physical 
        and technology policies in place to provide a robust security environment. 
        We ensure the on-going adequacy of these measures by regularly reviewing 
        them.</p>
      <p>Our security measures include, 
        but are not limited to:</p>
      <p>• restricting access 
        to our computer systems and physical records to authorised persons and 
        preventing users from accessing information they have no need to access;<br>
        • requiring employees to use unique passwords to gain access to 
        systems. These passwords are changed regularly and their use is independently 
        monitored;<br>
        • encrypting data sent from your computer to our systems during 
        Internet transactions and customer access codes transmitted across networks;<br>
        • employing firewalls, intrusion detection systems and virus scanning 
        tools to prevent unauthorised persons and viruses from entering our systems;<br>
        • using dedicated secure networks or encryption when we transmit 
        electronic data for purposes of outsourcing;<br>
        • practising a clean desk policy in all premises occupied by the 
        Commonwealth Bank Group and providing secure storage for physical records; 
        and<br>
        • detecting and preventing unauthorised access to buildings by employing 
        physical and electronic means such as alarms, cameras and guards as required.</p>
      <p>Where information 
        we hold is identified as no longer needed for any purpose we ensure it 
        is effectively and securely destroyed, for example, by shredding or pulping 
        in the case of paper records or by degaussing (demagnetism of the medium 
        using alternating electric currents) and other means in the case of electronic 
        records and equipment.</p>

      <p><strong>Collection 
        of information via web site activity</strong></p>
      <p>For statistical purposes we 
        collect information on web site activity (such as the number of users 
        who visit our web sites, the date and time of visits, the number of pages 
        viewed, navigation patterns, what country and what systems users have 
        used to access the site and, when entering one of our web sites from another 
        web site, the address of that web site) through the use of ‘cookies’. 
        This information on its own does not identify an individual but it does 
        provide members of the Commonwealth Bank Group with statistics that can 
        be used to analyse and improve their web sites.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>A ‘cookie’ is a 
        packet of information that allows the server (the computer that houses 
        the web site) to identify and interact more effectively with your computer.</p>
      <p>When you use one of our web 
        sites, we send you a temporary cookie that gives you a unique identification 
        number. A different identification number is sent each time you use one 
        of our web sites. Cookies do not identify individual users, although they 
        do identify a user’s browser type and your Internet Service Provider 
        (ISP).</p>
      <p>You can configure your browser 
        to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie 
        is sent. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screens to

        be able to use our web sites.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the effectiveness 
        of our web site advertising, we may use third parties to collect statistical 
        data. No personal data is collected on these occasions.</p>
      <p><strong>Links to other 
        websites</strong></p>
      <p>Our web sites may 
        contain links to non-Commonwealth Bank Group web sites. Whilst such links 
        are provided for your convenience, you should be aware that the information 
        handling practices of the linked web sites might not be the same as ours. 
        </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        <a name="telephone"></a>TELEPHONE</strong></p>
      <p>We may monitor and

      <p><strong><br>
        <a name="direct"></a>DIRECT MARKETING</strong></p>
      <p>One of the reasons we collect 
        personal information is so that we may provide you with information on 
        products and services offered by members of the Commonwealth Bank Group. 
        Whilst we are permitted by the Privacy Act to disclose personal information 
        to other members of the Group, and we do so to enable the Group to have 
        an integrated view of its customers, it is important to note that the 
        Group's policy is that members of the Group with whom you do not have 
        a relationship will not use that information for the purpose of contacting 
        you. </p>
      <p>For example, it is against 
        the Group's policy for Commonwealth Securities Limited (CommSec) to use 
        the personal information of Commonwealth Bank customers to identify and 
        direct market to people who did not already have a relationship with CommSec. 
        However, the Commonwealth Bank itself may inform a customer of the services 
        available from itself or from CommSec or other members of the Group provided 
        that the customer has not instructed the Bank not to direct market.</p>
      <p>You may, if you wish, indicate 
        that you do not want to receive information on products and services offered 
        by or through the collecting member by:</p>
      <p>• 'ticking the box' on 
        the form you sign when you take out a product or service; or <br>
        • contacting the collecting member at any time to indicate that 
        you wish to 'opt out' of receiving such information.</p>
      <p>Please note that if 
        you provide your information to more than one member of the Commonwealth 
        Bank Group, you will need to tell each member separately if you wish to 
        'opt out' of receiving information from them.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        <a name="changes"></a>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY AND INFORMATION HANDLING 
        PRACTICES</strong></p>
      <p>The Commonwealth Bank 
        Group may make changes to its privacy and information handling practices 
        from time to time for any reason. We will publish those changes on our 
        web sites and, if there are important changes or a lot of minor changes, 
        by updating this document. This document is dated January 03</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        <a name="access"></a>ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
      <p>You can request us to provide 
        you with access to the personal information we hold about you. </p>
      <p><strong>How to gain 
        access</strong></p>
      <p>Requests for access to limited 
        amounts of personal information, such as checking to see what address 
        or telephone number we have recorded, can generally be handled in a branch 
        or over the telephone.</p>
      <p>With regards to request for 
        access to more substantial amounts of personal information, such as details 
        of what is recorded in your loan file, we will require you to complete 
        and sign the attached 'Request for Access to Personal Information under 
        the National Privacy Principles' form, and either mail it to the Privacy 
        Officer, Customer Relations, Commonwealth Bank Group, Reply Paid 41, Sydney 
        NSW 2001, or hand it in at any Commonwealth Bank branch. Following receipt 
        of your request, our Customer Relations area will provide you with an 
        estimate of the access charge and confirm that you want to proceed. Unless 
        you have authorised us to debit your account, access will not be provided 
        until payment is received.</p>
      <p>If you wish to access 
        information that is held by Commonwealth Securities Limited, you will 
        need to obtain and complete a separate request form by contacting: Privacy 
        Officer, Client Relations, Commonwealth Securities Limited, Locked Bag 
        22, Australia Square NSW 1215. Telephone <strong>13 15 19</strong> (8am 
        to 7pm, Sydney time, Monday to Friday).</p>
      <p><strong>An access 
        charge may apply</strong></p>
      <p>An access charge may apply, 
        but not to the request itself. The charge is for the time we spend on 
        locating, collating and explaining the information you request (generally 
        based on a rate of $60 per hour or part thereof) plus any photocopying 
        costs and out of pocket expenses (such as freight and travelling costs).</p>
      <p> <strong>Responding 
        to an access request</strong></p>
      <p>We will respond to your access 
        request as soon as possible. We will endeavour to comply with your request 
        within 14 days of its receipt but, if that deadline cannot be met owing 
        to exceptional circumstances, your request will be dealt with within 30 
        days. It will help us provide access if you can tell us what you are looking 
        for. Your identity will be confirmed (including by verifying your signature) 
        before access is provided.</p>
      <p><strong>Requests may 
        be denied or limited</strong></p>
      <p>If particular circumstances 
        apply, we are permitted by the Privacy Act to deny your request for access, 
        or limit the access we provide. We will let you know why your request 
        is denied or limited. For example, we may give an explanation of a commercially-sensitive 
        decision, rather than direct access to evaluative information connected 
        with it.</p>
      <p><strong>Jointly held 
        information</strong></p>
      <p>Where we hold your personal 
        information in conjunction with that of another individual or individuals 
        (eg. where you jointly conduct an account), we will allow each individual 
        access to their own personal information and to the joint information 
        (eg. account balances and transaction details) but not to the personal 
        information of the other individual(s).</p>
      <p><strong>Access to 
        a credit report about you</strong></p>
      <p>You have the right to ask for 
        a copy of any credit report we have obtained about you from a credit reporting 
        agency. However, as we may not have retained a copy after we have used 
        it in accordance with Part IIIA of the Privacy Act, the best means of 
        obtaining an up-to-date copy is to get in touch with the credit reporting 
        agency direct. You have a right to have any inaccuracies corrected or, 
        if there is any dispute as to accuracy, to have a note added to your credit 
        reporting agency file explaining your position.</p>
      <p>If we decline your credit application 
        wholly or partly because of adverse information on your credit report, 
        the Privacy Act requires us to tell you of that fact and how you can go 
        about getting a copy of your credit report.</p>
      <p>The major credit reporting

      <p> <strong>Making a 
        privacy complaint</strong></p>
      <p>We recognise that even in the 
        best run organisations things can go wrong. Should you have a privacy 
        complaint, please tell us because it gives us the opportunity to fix the 
        problem. We offer a free internal and complaint resolution scheme to all 
        of our customers. Our personal and small business customers also have 
        free access to an external dispute resolution scheme.</p>
      <p>To assist us in helping you, 
        we ask you to follow a simple three-step process:</p>
      <p>1. Gather all supporting documents 
        about the matter of complaint, think about the questions you want answered 
        and decide on what you want us to do.</p>
      <p>2. Contact the relevant Commonwealth 
        Bank Group member, where your situation will be reviewed and if possible 
        resolved straight away. A quick chat is all that's required to resolve 
        most issues.</p>
      <p>3. If at this stage the matter 
        has not been resolved to your satisfaction, please contact our Customer 
        Relations team using the above contact points. We will provide you with 
        the name and contact details of the officer who will investigate your 
        complaint, answer your questions and do all they can to regain your confidence.</p>
      <p>If you are still not 
        satisfied, we will tell you about the external dispute resolution avenues 
        available to you.<br>
