Further, if you do not wish to receive certain emails or any emails at all then you can also visit <a href="https://www.comsol.com/preferences">https://www.comsol.com/preferences</a> to select the Unsubscribe option. You may only change your preferences using this link if you are logged-in to your COMSOL Access account, <a href="https://www.comsol.com/access">https://www.comsol.com/access</a>. Alternatively, your preferences can also be reached through the appropriate links in emails from COMSOL or by contacting the Privacy Manager at privacy@comsol.com. Note, as long as you continue to be an end user of, license holder of, or administrator for a license of COMSOL software, or are participating in the process of becoming an end user, license holder, or license administrator, you are not permitted to unsubscribe from or opt-out of emails and messages regarding your software licenses and the transactional processes, changes, updates, and technical and security notices regarding them, or other emails and messages regarding the support, maintenance, and use of the software.</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>

<p>COMSOL uses recognized technology and tools to protect the security of your data. Yet, due to the fact that no security system is impenetrable, COMSOL cannot completely and entirely guarantee the data security of COMSOL’s security systems. If these systems are breached and your data is compromised as a result of this, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the breach and, where appropriate, notify you about which data may have been compromised. COMSOL will also take other steps to address the breach in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Data</h3>

<p>COMSOL AB, its affiliates, and subsidiaries are the parties responsible for the management of COMSOL’s jointly-used storage of personal data. Contact information for COMSOL AB can be found at the bottom of this policy.
As a global organization, the data you provide to COMSOL may be transferred to or used by affiliates or subsidiaries of COMSOL AB and trusted third parties for the purposes described above, including locations outside the European Economic Area, such as those listed at: <a href="https://www.comsol.com/contact">https://www.comsol.com/contact</a>. COMSOL AB has established various safeguards to protect your data such as binding corporate rules and/or approved European Commission contractual clauses. A copy of these safeguards taken by COMSOL AB may be obtained by submitting your request to the address identified below for COMSOL’s Privacy Manager. </p>

<h3>Data Storage Retention</h3>

<p>All data that is collected will be stored only as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it is collected, or as long as is permitted or required by applicable law. Periodically, COMSOL will review its data processing systems to determine whether or not the purposes for the collection and processing of your data remain valid. That determination will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, whether or not you are still in contact with COMSOL, whether or not any requests made by you to COMSOL have been fulfilled (including any follow-up tasks), whether or not there is a contractual relationship between you and COMSOL, and whether or not there is a contractual or legal basis for continuing to retain your data. Based on that review and any notifications received from data subjects, COMSOL will update its systems. For more information on the purpose for which information is collected, please see Use of Data.</p>
                    <h3 class="first">Cookies, web beacons, local storage, and conversion tracking</h3>

<p>The Site stores cookies and web beacons on your web browser, and makes use of web storage and conversion tracking functionality.</p>

<p>Cookies are simple text files containing a string that functions as an identifier of stored data on COMSOL’s servers that is used to retrieve, employ, and present it on the Site. COMSOL uses their own cookies to improve functionality of the Site as well as your user experience. This may include automatically logging you in to access certain functionality, automatically populating forms, automatically presenting relevant and tailored content for your needs, and automatically remembering your email and other web-based preferences. The storage and use of cookies also allow COMSOL to filter out spam, bots and other malicious users and uses of the Site. These COMSOL cookies may be session cookies, which are cookies that are erased when you close your browser, or cookies that have up to a five (5) year retention period. All COMSOL cookie information is controlled by COMSOL and accessed only by COMSOL.</p>

<p>COMSOL also uses third party cookies on its Site for functionality, enhancing user experience, and marketing. The information about third party cookies is controlled by and accessible by those third parties. Third party cookies may be session or permanent cookies. For more information on those third party cookies, including how to disable those non-essential cookies and the privacy policies of those third parties, please see Third Party Tools below.</p>

<p>Similar to cookies, web storage is used to store browsing-relevant data on a local database within your browser. It is used to remember the state your browsing history was in the last time you were on the Site. This includes remembering view preferences such as your last sorting of lists, allowing your videos to continue playing from where they last left off, and recovering your in-progress comments or posts on the Site’s forums.</p>

<p>COMSOL may also use web beacons on the Site or in emails sent to you. These are HTML elements, for example images, loaded from a web server passing along an identifier with the load request. Web beacons are used to monitor your navigation when visiting the Site or when opening specific emails.</p>

<p>COMSOL also uses conversion tracking (also known as tracking links) in emails or on the Site or third-party sites to record and transmit which link, element, or component on a webpage or in an email was used by you.</p>

<p>These tools make it possible for us to improve the effectiveness of our messages and provide you with better tailored information on the Site and in email communications. You can configure your browser to deny the storage and/or and use of cookies, web beacons, local storage, and conversion tracking. Some webpages and features on the Site may not be made available or able to function if storage and/or use of this data are denied. For more information on how third-parties store and use data accessed through cookies, web beacons, local storage, and conversion tracking, see the section on Third Party Tools, Sites, and Services.</p>

<h3>Third Party Tools, Sites, and Services</h3>

<p>COMSOL uses third-party tools including, but not limited to, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reports, Wistia, HotJar, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Yandex, VKontakte, and Baidu for the collection, analysis, and/or use of data associated with browsing activity and the type and origin of software and hardware used to engage in that activity. This data is stored on COMSOL’s or the third-party tools’ web servers. </p>

<p>If you have chosen to enable Google to associate your browsing history and other data with your Google Account, Google will collect Google-authenticated identifiers associated with your Google Account and will temporarily connect these identifiers to your Google Analytics data in order to improve the effectiveness of COMSOL messages and provide you with better tailored information on the Site and in email communications. COMSOL may also share your analytics data with third-party contractors who help analyze the data and improve the Site. For more information concerning the use of cookies by Google, please see: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types</a>.</p>

<p>You can prevent these tools from storing and analyzing your browsing history by: disabling cookies and other means of storing data through your browser’s settings; by using the Google Analytics’ Opt-out Browser Add-on available at: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>; or by using the disabling features supported by other third-party tools.</p>

<p>COMSOL advertises and markets itself, its products, and services on different sites across the internet through using cookies and browsing histories collated and applied by third-party tools that include, but are not limited to, Google Adwords. Most of these third-party tools allow you to opt-out of remarketing and tailored online advertising through using the Do Not Track functionality in your web browser or through other methods specified by your browser and/or the respective third-party tool. In particular, you can opt out of Google’s tailored ad serving by visiting Google’s Ads Settings at: <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">http://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>. For more information about the privacy policies of Google, Google Adwords, and Google+, please see:  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy</a>.</p>

<p>The Site also incorporates “Like" buttons associated with social media sites including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn that, if you are logged in to one of these sites, will transfer the link (URL) that you “liked” to your account or page on that respective social media site.</p>

<p>The data collected and stored by these third-party tools is not used by COMSOL to identify you or connect personally identifiable data to you. Further, the providers of these third-party tools are limited in their ability to use and share information they collect by their terms and privacy policies.

<h3>Your Rights to Your Personal Data</h3>

<p>You have the right to be informed about the collection and use of your personal data. You have the right to access your personal data and have it corrected if it is wrong or incomplete. You have the right to restrict the processing of your data where the accuracy of your personal data is contested, where the processing is unlawful, and where we no longer need the personal data for the purposes for which we have processed it. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data and also restrict its processing in those instances where we undertook processing of it in carrying out a task in the public interest or where necessary for our legitimate interest where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. You have the right to withdraw consent that you have given to the collection and processing of your personal data at any time. If you do withdraw your consent to the collection and processing of your personal data, that withdrawal shall not affect the lawfulness of any processing by us that is based on the consent you have given before you withdrew it. You also have the right to obtain the deletion of your data when it is no longer relevant to the purposes for which it was collected or processed, when you have withdrawn consent and there is no basis for us to continue processing, when you have objected to further processing and there is no compelling interest for continued processing, and when the data was unlawfully processed.</p>

<p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal affects concerning you or similarly affecting you, except where there is a lawful basis for continued processing.  You have the right to receive personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable form for the purpose of data portability in those instances where we process by automated means personal data that you have provided. </p>

<p>These rights may be exercised by using the tools we offer on the Site or by contacting COMSOL AB with your specific request through the methods described below.
