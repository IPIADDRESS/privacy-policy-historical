<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Comic Rocket Commitment
to Privacy</strong> </p>

<p>Comic Rocket is committed
to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the
following Privacy Policy to protect the personal information you provide us
online. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Site at <a href="http://www.comic-rocket.com/">www.comic-rocket.com</a> (“Site”) and
information collected for us or by us through our Site and through various
features and online offerings on our Site. It does not apply to any third party
site or service linked to our Site or recommended or referred by our Site or by
our staff. Further, it does not apply to any other Site or online service
operated by Zinofile, Inc. dba Comic Rocket, or to any of our offline
activities.&nbsp; Questions regarding this
policy should be directed to info@comic-rocket.com</p>

<p><strong>Collection and Use of
Information</strong></p>

<p>Comic Rocket collects three different types of
information through the Site: personally identifiable information needed for
site operations, information that users choose to make public, and anonymous
information.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable
Information Needed for Site Operations: Comic Rocket will only collect your
personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or telephone
number) if you provide it voluntarily. If you do not want this information to
be collected by us, please do not submit it. Comic Rocket will not retain your
personal information longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it is
collected.&nbsp; We only use the personally
identifiable information which is provided through our Site to help us improve
our services to you, to provide you with the products and services you have
requested, to inform you about additional products or services that may be of
interest to you, for marketing purposes and for other internal purposes. Comic
Rocket occasionally may hire other companies to provide limited services on our
behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering
customer questions about products or services, sending mail and processing
event registration. Comic Rocket will only provide these companies with the
information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from
using that information for any other purpose. If after providing Comic Rocket
with personally identifiable information,&nbsp;
you do not wish to receive marketing and similar promotional
communications from Comic Rocket, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@comic-rocket.com">info@comic-rocket.com</a></p>

<p>Other than what is
described, Comic Rocket does not sell, trade or rent your personal information
to others outside of Comic Rocket companies and their advertising and
promotional agencies and consultants.&nbsp;
Comic Rocket will
never give or sell your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated
third parties to be used for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial
offers (such as spam).&nbsp;&nbsp; At any time,
while accessing our site, any user, while online, may decline participation in
any activity that asks for information (i.e. survey email, or ecommerce). Your
choice not to participate will in no way affect your ability to use any other
feature on our site.</p>

<p>Comic Rocket may also
need to contact you for purposes other than marketing, for example to provide
notice about the status of the Comic Rocket Site or the specific products or
services you have requested. We also use this information to the extent
necessary to enforce our Site terms of service and to prevent imminent harm to
persons or property.&nbsp; You may not opt-out
of these kinds of communications.&nbsp;
Consistent with our change policy (see Your Consent and Notification of
Changes below), we will post any updates or notices about material changes in
our policies on collection and use of your personally identifiable information
to this Privacy Policy page and other places we deem appropriate for notifying
our visitors and customers of the changes.</p>

<p>Please note that
notwithstanding our general nondisclosure policy, Comic Rocket will disclose
personally identifiable information when required by law, or if we have a
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a current
judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, (b) protect
and defend our rights, or (c) protect the rights, property, and other interests
of our users or others.</p>

<p><strong>Information That Users
Choose to Make Public</strong></p>

<p>Our Site includes various
social networking and sharing features that allow users to make information
public.&nbsp; Anything that you specifically
ask us to make public (your comics reading list, your recommendations, links to
your facebook profile, etc.) we may make public.&nbsp; Opting into such services on the Site is
entirely voluntary.&nbsp; If you choose to opt
into such services on the Site, you expressly give us permission to make the
information – including, where relevant, personally identifable information –
public.&nbsp; In addition, to the extent that
you post public comments, reviews, etc. on the Site, you expressly give Zinofile, Inc. dba Comic Rocket a
license to use that information (please see Section 6 of our<strong>&nbsp;<span class="plugin_link"><a href="/terms/">Terms of Use</a></span>
</strong>&nbsp;for details).</p>

<p>Anonymous Information:&nbsp; In addition, in the course of using
our site we automatically track certain anonymous, aggregate information about
your visit to the Comic Rocket Site. This information may include, for example, the URL that you just came from
(whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether
this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP
address. Many sites automatically collect this information. The anonymous
information that we do collect from your visit is never linked to any of your
personally identifiable information until you voluntarily submit that personal
information. We use the anonymous information in the aggregate for purposes such
as to generate statistical reports about the use of our Site or to improve the
quality of our Service.&nbsp; We may provide
this anonymous information to other parties or use it internally.&nbsp; Our use of this anonymous information about
how our visitors and customers interact with the Service is not restricted in
any way other than it is and remains in a form that is not linked to any
personally identifiable information or otherwise identifies any particular
visitor or customer.</p>

<p>We also employ the use of
cookies to assist us in this process. A cookie is a small piece of computer
code that enables web servers to identify users. Cookies do not store any personally identifiable information that you have provided to our site. You have
the ability to delete cookie files from your hard drive at any time or avoid
cookies by configuring your browser to reject them or to notify you when a
cookie is being placed on your hard drive.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>Comic Rocket has
implemented a number of security features throughout the Comic Rocket site to
prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For
example, passwords are
stored in industry-standard hashed form, and backups containing
personally-identifiable information are encrypted.
Please be advised, however, that although Comic Rocket has endeavored to create
a secure and reliable site for you, the confidentiality of any communication or
material transmitted to or from Comic Rocket via the Comic Rocket site or
e-mail cannot be guaranteed. When disclosing any personal information, you
should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to the
public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your
consent. Comic Rocket has no responsibility or liability for the security of information
transmitted via the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>External Web Sites</strong></p>

<p>To the extent hyperlinks
or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks are utilized to access third
party sites, you should be aware that these third party web sites are not
controlled by Comic Rocket and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy
Policy. You should check the privacy policies of these individual sites to see
how your personal information will be utilized by the operators of those third
party web sites.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to Comic Rocket’s Business</strong></p>

<p>In the event Comic Rocket goes through a
business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale
of all or a portion of its assets, our customers’ personally identifiable
information may be part of the assets transferred. &nbsp;The information transferred or shared remains
subject to the promises made in this Privacy Policy, unless you agree to new
terms.</p>

<p><strong>Your Consent and Notification of Changes</strong></p>

<p>By using our Site, you
consent to the collection and use of this information by Comic Rocket. Comic
Rocket may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to make a
material change in our Privacy Policy, we will post that change on this page
and on any other pages or locations we deem important to alert you about the
change in our privacy and information collection practices . Your continued use
of this Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you
accept these changes. In some cases, we may attempt to contact you through an
email or other address you have provided to give you information and choices
about our using your personally identifiable information in a manner different
from that stated at the time of collection.&nbsp;
In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices
that affect your personally identifiable information already stored in our
database, we apply those changes to the personally identifiable information in
our possession only with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable
law.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Changing Your Information and Opting Out</strong></p>

<p>You may have the right to
access the personal information which Comic Rocket has collected about you. You
may also have the right to modify any errors contained in that information.
Please contact us for more details. Our Site provides visitors and customers
the opportunity to opt-out of receiving specific types of communications from
us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor
or customer. In addition, you may unsubscribe or opt out of all future
communications from us that do not relate to the products and services you have
ordered by removing your contact and personally identifiable information from
our marketing and communications databases by clicking the unsubscribe link on
any email marketing communication you receive.</p>

<p><strong>Further Information about Comic Rocket Privacy Policy and
Practices</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy
applies to all visitors and customers of our Site. If you become an inactive
customer, or if we close or suspend your account, we will continue to adhere to
the Privacy Policy in place when we collected your personally identifiable
information so long as we retain it in our databases.&nbsp; We may delete any or all of your information
at any time without notice to you for any reason or no reason unless otherwise
required by law to retain it.&nbsp; You may
have other privacy protections under state laws and we will comply with any
applicable state laws when we disclose information about you. This Privacy
Policy replaces our previous policy on this topic and any statements or
disclosures to you about our information practices.</p>
