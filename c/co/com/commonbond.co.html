		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Welcome to CommonBond. This Privacy Statement describes how CommonBond collects and shares information from our website, located at <a href="http://commonbond.co/">http://commonbond.co/</a>.</p>
	<h3>How Does CommonBond Work?</h3>
	<p>CommonBond does not issue loans directly to students. Students who are interested in joining the CommonBond community apply for student loans issued by our partner bank, who makes all decisions on issuing or denying student loans. CommonBond purchases approved loans from our partner bank on behalf of our investors.</p>
	<h3>What Information Does CommonBond Collect From Visitors to This Website?</h3>
	<p>Because CommonBond does not issue loans, we do not collect loan application information such as social security number, income or assets. However, we do collect the following information from students and visitors to our website:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>information you provide on our website such as contact information, school affiliation or feedback; and</li>
		<li>basic traffic information about your visit such as IP address, host name and pages on our site visited.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We do not collect personally identifiable information from website visitors who do not voluntarily submit such information. However, information collected from prior visits could be associated with personally identifiable information if you later submit such information to us.</p>

	<h3>How Does CommonBond Use Information Collected From Visitors to This Website?</h3>
	<o>We use information collected from website visitors to improve the content and browsing experience of our website and to provide information regarding our products to you. This information is not sold or disclosed to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes.</o>
	<p>CommonBond may disclose information collected from website visitors to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>trusted services providers who work on our behalf, who do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in the privacy statement;</li>
		<li>third parties as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;</li>
		<li>third parties as we deem necessary, based on our good faith belief, (i) to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, (ii) to investigate fraud, or (iii) to respond to a government request; and</li>
		<li>third parties in conjunction with a merger, acquisition or sale of CommonBond. If CommonBond is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information.
		Information obtained about loan applications and decisions from our partner bank may be used to improve our services or offer additional services. Use of information obtained from our partner bank will be used in accordance with the partner bank’s privacy policy.</li>
