<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>As part of the Comodo pledge to our customers, we recognize and respect your right 
to privacy. This privacy policy statement informs our customers of the privacy 
practices employed in the provision of Comodo's products, services and website.</p>
<p>Questions relating to this policy statement should be directed towards the 
 Comodo support team at <a href="mailto:info@comodogroup.com">info@comodogroup.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CPS and Associated Agreements</strong><br>

 This Privacy Policy statement supplements the practices and policies stated 
 within the Subscriber Agreement (and associated product Schedules), Relying 
 Party Agreement and Comodo Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Please refer 
 to these documents for the practices employed by Comodo for the issuing, management 
 and revocation of certificate based products.</p>
     <p><a href="http://www.comodo.com/repository/index.html">http://www.comodo.com/repository/index.html 
        </a></p>
<p><strong>Informational Collection and Use</strong><br>
 Comodo does not collect any information on customers without consent. As part 
 of the service offerings, customers will be prompted for information when enrolling 
 for a certificate, downloading a product or requesting further information. 
 No information is collected about a customer if they are just browsing the website.</p>
<p><span class="p3"><strong>Anti-Spam Policy</strong></span><br>
 Comodo does not employ the use of spam for propagating its product awareness 
 or special offers.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate enrolment</strong><br>

 When enrolling for a certificate, customers will be required to provide certain 
 information as per the requirements for the certificate product type. The exact 
 informational requirements are set out in the relevant Subscriber Agreement 
 and associated schedules and listed in the Comodo CPS. Some of the submitted 
 details will be displayed within the certificate and as a result will be publicly 
 available. Details that will become public are clearly stated as 'public' in 
 the enrolment process, Subscriber Agreement and associated schedules. </p>
<p><strong>Product Download</strong><br>
 When downloading a Comodo product, such as the Firewall, you will 
 be required to submit personal information as specified on the download page. 
 This information will be used by Comodo to contact the customer about the services 
 on our site for which they have expressed interest, including product updates 
 and associated promotional material. It also aids Comodo in providing improved 
 global services by collating general demographic information. Please refer to 
 the opt-out policy described later in this policy statement.</p>
<p><strong>Information Request</strong><br>
 Comodo provides the ability to request further information or ask questions to 
 the support team by displaying email links throughout the website. If a customer 
 elects to use such links they may be requested to provide additional information 
 depending on the nature of the contact. Typically, such additional information 
 may include further contact details, and in the case of technical support, additional 
 information about the customer's PC configuration may be required to aid a prompt 
 and accurate response to the query.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
 A cookie is a piece of data stored on a computer's hard disk containing information 
 about the owner. At the time of publishing this statement Comodo may employ the 
 use of cookies for measuring the success of advertising and affiliate network 
 membership. Our partners may use cookies. Comodo does not exercise any access 
 or control of such cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
 Comodo uses log files comprising of IP addresses to analyze trends, administer 
 the site, track movements throughout the site, calculate the number of document 
 and file downloads, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 
 IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong><br>
 Comodo will share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This 
 is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
<p><strong>External Links</strong><br>
 The Comodo website contains links to external websites. Comodo is not responsible 
 for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies 
 solely to information collected by this website. Comodo has no control over 
 the accuracy of information displayed by such websites.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
 This website takes every precaution to protect our customer's information. When 
 customers submit sensitive information via the website, such information is 
 protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>During certificate enrollment, where sensitive information is required, the 
 transmission of information is encrypted and protected using <a href="http://www.instantssl.com">Secure Sockets 
 Layer</a> (<a href="http://www.instantssl.com" target="_blank">SSL</a>). This includes the submission of any payment information such as 
 credit card details.</p>
<p>Comodo uses <a href="http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html" target="_blank">SSL encryption</a> to protect sensitive information online and do everything 
 in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our customer’s information, 
 not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. 
 Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example 
 billing administration or the development team) are granted access to personally 
 identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers 
 when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password 
 to re-gain access to customer information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept 
 up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as 
 any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
 about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our 
 customers' information is protected. The servers that we store personally identifiable 
 information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. The cryptographic 
 keys used to issue certificates are maintained in the secure environment of 
 FIPS-140 level 4 accredited IBM 4758 crypto devices.</p>
<p><strong>Supplementation of Information (validation of submitted details)</strong><br>
 In order for Comodo to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is 
 necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 
 3rd party sources.</p>
<p>For example, prior to the issuance of some certificate types Comodo may use 
 the WHOIS database, Government source companies house database or Dun &amp; 
 Bradstreet company lookup information to validate the accuracy of supplied data. 
 This is an integral aspect of the service provided by Comodo.</p>
<p><strong>Service Updates</strong><br>

 Established customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, 
 special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our customers 
 we present the option not to receive these types of communications. We also 
 send the user service announcement updates. Customers are not able to unsubscribe 
 from service announcements, which may contain important security information 
 about the service.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Customer Information</strong><br>
 If a customer's personally identifiable information or certificate specific 
 information changes they may update the original information provided. Changes 
 can be made by logging into the Members area and using the services provided 
 in the Manage Account section.</p>
<p><strong>Choice / Opt out</strong><br>
 Customers are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having information used 
 for purposes not directly related to the Comodo service offering at the point 
 where the information is requested. For example, all certificate enrolment and 
 product downloads has an 'opt-out' mechanism so customers who buy a product 
 from us, but would prefer not to receive any marketing material, can request 
 to have their email address kept off of our lists.</p>
<p>If customers no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials 
 from our partners, they may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing 
 Comodo at <a href="mailto:info@comodogroup.com">info@comodogroup.com</a>. </p>

<p>Customers of our site are always notified when their information is being collected 
 by any outside parties. We do this so our customers can make an informed choice 
 as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, 
 or not.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Revocation &amp; Expiry</strong><br>
 Access to all issued certificates is provided through the Comodo public repository. 
 Because of the nature of the service provided, there may be circumstances under 
 which a certificate is revoked (cancelled). Furthermore, as the lifetime of 
 all certificates is finite (lasting usually 1 year), certificates will expire.</p>
<p>Comodo still provides public access to both revoked and expired certificates 
 to ensure a party relying on the certificate may still be able to retrieve the 
 certificate and verify a signature made with the certificate. Such certificates 
 are flagged as revoked or expired within the repository.</p>
<p><strong>Customer consent</strong><br>
        By using our Web site, customers consent to the collection and use of 
        this information by Comodo CA Limited. If any subsequent changes are made 
        to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the policy update 
        page so that customers are always aware of what information is collected, 
        how it is used and under what circumstances it may be disclosed.</p>
