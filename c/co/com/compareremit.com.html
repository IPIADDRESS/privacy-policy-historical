All personally identifiable information supplied by you to us via compareremit.com is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or similarly secure technology. We allow personally identifiable information to be accessed only by persons with specified rights to do so. </p> <p> You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information in visible forum online (whether through CompareRemit's services or any other services available online), personal or otherwise, that information could be collected and used by others. For example, if you post a review on CompareRemit or use chat forums, bulletin boards, and you post your e-mail or other identifying information, you may receive unsolicited messages form others. CompareRemit has no control over this use of your personal data. </p> <p> Due to the open nature of communication through the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and CompareRemit, or between CompareRemit and the insurance carriers to which you ask us to submit your information, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties, nor that third parties will not be able to circumvent the safeguards we have put in place.

However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.</p> <p> We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. </p> <p>To exercise your rights with respect to your personal data or otherwise ask us about our collection and processing of your personal data, use our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.compareremit.com/about-us/">contact us form</a>.</p> <p></p> <br> <p> <strong>CHANGES</strong> </p><p> Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
