				<h1>Privacy</h1>
				<img class="image imageright" src="img/icon-privacy.jpg" alt="Privacy">
				<p class="clearfix">The Computer History Museum (CHM) is concerned about protecting the privacy of all CHM web site visitors. CHM respects your privacy and your 
                choice not to have your personal information shared with other people. CHM has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to 
                protecting your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our policy. Your use of our web site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. </p>

				<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
				<p>The Computer History Museum web site does not collect personally identifying data, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and the like, except when 
                voluntarily submitted by web site visitors. Information collected from visitors of the CHM web site is used to make our web site more useful by helping us learn 
                about the number of visitors to our site, the areas they access and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about 
                individuals and their visits. We may compile and report aggregate statistics about our web visitors — such as numbers, traffic patterns, and related 
                site information — but these statistics include no personally identifying information.</p>			

				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>The Computer History Museum (CHM) web site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our 
                control. Attempts to gain access to restricted portions of this web site or to this web site's technical infrastructure, for whatever purpose, are logged and 
                may prompt commencement of an investigation by CHM staff, or local, federal (U.S.) or international law-enforcement agencies. Various provisions exist to 
                monitor activities which could be deemed suspicious in terms of network or site security. In cases where such provisions are activated, you should have no 
                expectation of privacy. </p>

				<h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
				<p>The Computer History Museum (CHM) will not disclose or share any personal information you provide to CHM with any other third party without your permission, 
                except if requested to do so in accordance with a court order, subpoena, or similar legal order, and in the event such disclosure is necessary to protect the 
                rights, property, and safety of CHM, its visitors, and other third parties. CHM will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others without 
                your permission.</p>
