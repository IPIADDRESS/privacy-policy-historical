and United Media are committed to protecting consumer privacy online. We believe that greater protection of personal privacy on the web will not only protect consumers, but also increase consumer confidence and ultimately their participation in online activities. At Comics.com, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information (individually identifiable information about an individual collected online) and strive to help you protect your privacy while using our services.
<br><br>
The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the information. Please read this notice. By using this site, you signify your assent to our privacy policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites.
<br><br>
Comics.com and United Media have special concerns about the privacy of users who are children under the age of 13. When children use the general audience site, United Media will not collect any personal information from them. Parents are strongly encouraged to participate in their children's online activities and monitor their children's use of e-mails and engagement in other electronic communication. Again, Comics.com does not collect personal information online from children under the age of 13, and only persons with credit cards can purchase product from the United Media Store.
<br><br>
<b><u>I. Information Which We Collect and the What We Do With the Collected Information<br><br></u></b>
We have two areas on our web site, a general audience area (where the various comics appear) and the United Media Store, in which users can purchase products related to various comics featured on the general web site. Each area has different privacy practices.

Our general audience area does not collect any personal information from visitors. This area does not use tracking software that can identify you personally while you are visiting these sections.

(See below for more details regarding information collected at the United Media Store site.)

 United Media uses cookies in the United Media Store to securely keep track of
 selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." United Media
 and DoubleClick’s cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are
 not. Many improvements and updates to our website are based on the data
 collected through the cookies such as total number of visitors and pages

T<font color="#CC3300">he advertising contained on Comics.com and the United Media Store is delivered to you by DoubleClick. In the course of delivering an ad to you, DoubleClick does not collect any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. DoubleClick does, however,
<font size="2">use cookies (see Section II for a discussion of
"cookies") to </font>collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered.

The non-personally identifiable information collec</font>ted by DoubleClick is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of DoubleClick's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it. For more information regarding the methods and technology used to collect this information, how DoubleClick uses this information, who gets access to the information and what measures are taken to secure the data obtained, please view DoubleClick's privacy policy, which can be viewed by <b><a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy"> clicking here</a></b>.<br>

<br><br>
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Arial">
You can opt-out of DoubleClick tracking by <b><a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/privacy.htm">clicking here</a></b>. (Scroll down to the middle of the page and click on the "opt out click here" graphic.) When you opt-out via this method you officially opt-out of DoubleClick's targeting programs for your browser. You need to do this for each browser, on each machine you surf on. So, if you use multiple browsers (AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer) you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly, if you connect to the web from multiple machines (e.g. work and home) you need to explicitly opt-out from each browser on each machine.

<br><br>
Our site may contain links to other web sites, including web sites directed to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our advertisers or other sites to which we provide links from our sites. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement,  the click takes you off the Comics.com site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. We have no control over these practices and strongly recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of the web site sponsor when linking to other web sites.
<br><br>
Comics.com's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond United Media's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or government regulation.

We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information submitted by users. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of information from your PC to our computers.

While we strive to take great care to protect your personal information, Comics.com and United Media cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We do offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it when collecting credit card information for online purchases. We also store any personal information, including credit card numbers, in an area to which the general public does not have access to it.

Remember to sign off the Comics.com site and close your browser window when you are finished. This is to ensure that others cannot pose as you online.
