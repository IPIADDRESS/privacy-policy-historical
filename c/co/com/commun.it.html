<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>All terms in capital letters not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the GR8PPL's Terms of Use as they appear in the Website. This Privacy Policy is hereby attached by reference to the ToU, and serves as an integral part thereof.</b></p>
<p>GR8PPL Ltd. ("<b>GR8PPL</b>") respects your right to privacy. Please read below to understand more about our privacy policy. This Privacy Policy applies to the Website and Services granted therein, and governs Data collection and usage thereof. By using our Website, the Services and/or the Data, accessing, providing certain credentials for third party websites, browsing or otherwise submitting information, including Data, to the Website, you acknowledge and consent to the collection and use of such information by GR8PPL as set forth below and in the <a href="/content/terms">ToU</a> </p>
<p><b>Acceptance</b></p>
<p>By using Services (defined below) and/or accessing, browsing, submitting information to, or other use of the Website, You signify Your assent to both this Privacy Policy. If You do not agree to any of these terms, You may not use, and therefore immediately cease any use of, the Services and/or the Website. The Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, and the latest version of the Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website. Any changes made to this Privacy Policy shall be effective immediately following the posting of such changes. You hereby agree to review the Privacy Policy published on the Website from time to time and agree that any subsequent access to or use by You of the Services and/or the Website shall constitute Your acceptance of all the changes thereof.</p>
<p><b>Collection of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>While providing the Services, GR8PPL may collect or receive Personal Information, whether provided directly by you or obtain through the use of Your credentials through other websites to which You are subscribed.</p>
<p>There is also information about Your computer hardware and software and the use thereof, that is automatically collected by GR8PPL during the use of the Website and the Services. This information can include, without limitation and without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, Your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Website addresses. </p>
<p>The information as described above is used by GR8PPL for provision of the Service, to maintain quality of the Service, and for general statistics regarding use of the Website and the Service and use habits of the Website's and Service's users.</p>
<p><b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>GR8PPL collects and uses Personal Information for the provision of the Services. If, upon subscription to the Service, You've confirmed your assent to receive promotional and other commercial information by GR8PPL, then GR8PPL shall be entitled to use certain aspects of the Personal Information for promotional purposes, such as to offer You additional products or services. Under such authorization, GR8PPL shall not divulge such Personal Information to third parties.</p>
<p>When You open a Client Account and provide GR8PPL with Your credentials (such as username and password) to other third party websites, it shall be used by GR8PPL solely for the purpose of providing the Service and shall not be transferred to third parties by GR8PPL. GR8PPL may contact You, from time to time, on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to You. In those cases, Your Personal Information and contact details shall not be transferred to such third parties.</p>
<p><b>GR8PPL WILL NOT USE OR DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION, WITHOUT YOUR EXPLICIT CONSENT.</b></p>
<p>GR8PPL keeps track of the Website in general, and of its users' visits of the Website in particular, in order to determine popularity of certain features, functionality of the Website and for other purposes, including commercial purposes. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the Website to users whose behavior indicates that they are more interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<p>GR8PPL will disclose Your Data, as provided via the Website, to third parties, without prior notice, only if: (a) GR8PPL is required to do so by law, or if (b) GR8PPL believes in good faith that such action is necessary to conform or comply with the provisions of any law or with legal proceedings, to protect the rights or property of GR8PPL and/or to protect the personal safety of users of GR8PPL or the public.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save You time. The purpose of a Cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if You personalize Your Client Account pages, or register with the Website or different Services therein, a Cookie helps GR8PPLto recall Your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording Your personal information, such as IP addresses, username and so on. When you return to the Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so You can easily use the Website features that You customized.</p>

If You choose to decline Cookies, You may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the services provided in the Website or other web sites You visit.</p>
<p><b>Security of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>GR8PPL reasonably secures the Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, and keeps such information on computer servers in a standard controlled and secured environment. The GR8PPL's data bases on which Your Data (and Personal Information therein) are reserved, are reasonably secured and programmed for protection from exposure and unauthorized use of such Data and/or Personal Information.</p>
<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>GR8PPL may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, by placement of an updated Privacy Policy in the Website. GR8PPL encourages You to periodically review this Privacy Policy from time to time, so to be informed of the subject matters hereof.</p>
<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Israel, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
