	<p>We respect your right to privacy.  Here is how we typically use the data you provide.</p>
	<p>We periodically make lists of our customers available to carefully screened mailers of quality goods and services.  If you don't wish to receive such mailings, please visit our customer service site at <a href="http://www.zmcirc.com/service/">service.ziffdavis.com</a> or send mail to the <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.zmcirc.com/service/address.html','newwin','width=350,height=450,top=0,left=0');">magazine's address</a>.<br><br> Please allow two weeks for new subscription orders to be processed before contacting customer service.</p>
	<p>The data we collect from subscriptions is also used in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the entire subscriber audience in order to improve the magazine.  We also share aggregate information with our advertisers to help them better understand our services.</p>
	<p>We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information.</p></font>
