            <li>Comm100 uses robust security measures to protect data from unauthorized access,
                maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of User Data. When the
                Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version
                2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology
                protects User Data using both server authentication and data encryption. The chat
                content in Comm100 Live Chat can be encrypted with SSL if the User chooses to use
                SSL. These technologies help ensure that User Data is safe, secure, and only available
                to the User to whom the information belongs and those to whom the User has granted
                access. Comm100 also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data
                and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure
                server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent
                interference or access from outside intruders.
