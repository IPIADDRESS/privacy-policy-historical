        <span class="borderSpan">1. What does Comm100 do?</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Comm100 provides open source and free hosted customer service and communication
                software for small and medium businesses. Comm100 focuses on developing and managing
                fully integrated customer support solutions to enable businesses to communicate
                with their customers more effectively through multiple communication channels, including
                live chat, forum, newsletter, knowledge base, email case management and ticketing
                system. </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="borderSpan">2. Personal Information Collected</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Comm100 offers a variety of services that are collectively referred to as the "Service".
                Comm100 collects information from individuals who visit the Company's Web sites
                (herein referred to as "Visitors") and individuals who download the Company's software
                or register to use the Service (herein referred to as "Users").
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>When you express an interest in obtaining additional information about the Service,
                downloading the software or registering to use the Service, Comm100 requires you
                to provide the Company with contact information, such as name, web site URL and
                email address ("Required Contact Information"). Comm100 may also ask you to provide
                additional information, such as company address, number of employees, or industry
                ("Optional Information").
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>As you navigate the Company's Web sites, Comm100 may also collect information through
                the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons

            <li>Besides the signing up user, you may have other team members or customer service
                representatives in your organization ("Operator") using Comm100 software or services.
                An Operator is an internal user of your organization, often a customer service representative.

            <li>Individual records of User Data may be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of
                investigating an abuse complaint in Comm100 Newsletter, resolving a problem, support
                issues, or suspected violation of the Comm100 Hosted Service Agreement, or as may

        <ul>
            <li>Comm100 uses robust security measures to protect data from unauthorized access,
                maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use of User Data. When the

                2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology
                protects User Data using both server authentication and data encryption. The chat
                content in Comm100 Live Chat can be encrypted with SSL if the User chooses to use
                SSL. These technologies help ensure that User Data is safe, secure, and only available
                to the User to whom the information belongs and those to whom the User has granted
                access. Comm100 also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data
                and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure
                server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent
                interference or access from outside intruders.
