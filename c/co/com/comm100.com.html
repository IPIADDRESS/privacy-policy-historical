We may get information about you from Organizations or collect information about you on behalf of organizations that use our services. If you do not want us to collect this personal data directly from you, please do not provide it.</p><h5>Direct collection of personal data</h5><ul class="c-content-list-1 c-theme c-separator-dot c-margin-l-20 c-font-thin"><li>Consumer personal data: We collect and process personal data about Consumers (e.g., chat visitors) on behalf of Organizations when interacting with Comm100 Services to facilitate the communications between the agents of Organizations and Consumers.</li><li>User personal data: We collect personal data about users who are tasked by Organizations to interact with Comm100 and who have account login credentials to access the Comm100 Services.

Examples of User personal data include, but are not limited to, name, login user name, email, phone, password, Organization details (e.g., Organization name, address, phone number, website address and billing information), organizational role, system information, and other information used to access all or part of the Comm100 Services or to contact Comm100 about its contract for products or services or need for support and when requesting information about the status of the Comm100 Services.</li><li>Business personal data: This means business-contact personal data which is not Consumer or User personal data, such as name, title, job function, business name, business address, business e-mail address, and business phone number that we collect about people we serve or work with, including actual and prospective customers, alliance and channel partners, contractors, vendors and other parties interested in Comm100 or its products and services. This includes visitors to our website, individuals who fill in forms requesting us to contact them or requesting any resources, individuals who attend any events where we demonstrate our Services, including industry events such as tradeshows and seminars, and other individuals with whom we interact for business purposes, including without limitation marketing. We also purchase information about potential leads from third parties and we use publicly available personal data.</li></ul><h5>Information We Automatically Collect from You When You Use the Services</h5><p>The personal data we collect automatically is statistical information and may include personal data, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal data we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. If you do not want us to collect this personal data, please do not use the Services.</p><ul class="c-content-list-1 c-theme c-separator-dot c-margin-l-20 c-font-thin"><li>Information collected through our cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies. Comm100, or service providers on our behalf, may use technologies, including “cookies,” “web beacons” and other tracking technologies to automatically collect personal data from you when you use the Services. We collect this personal data to, among other things, improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. We use these cookies and tracking technologies to analyze trends, administer the Comm100 website and Service, track users’ movements around website and Service, track the Web Site Navigational Information, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, to remember users’ settings and for authentication purposes. Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored within your Internet browser, which saves and recognizes your browsing habits. Comm100 uses both session cookies (which track a user’s progression during one site visit) and persistent cookies (which track a user over time). Web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear GIFs) are web page elements that can help deliver cookies, count visits, track browser type, identify your IP address, understand usage and marketing campaign effectiveness, recognize certain types of information on your computer, in your email or on your mobile device, such as the time and date you viewed a page, which emails are opened, which links are clicked, and similar information.</li><li>Visitor information. As is true of most websites, we gather certain personal data (collectively referred to as “Visitor Information”) automatically and store it in database. This personal data may include internet protocol (IP) addresses and usage data such as browser type, browser language, device identifier, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, length of visit, pages viewed, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, crashes, system activity, hardware settings, the date and time of requests, referral URL and other usage data. We may combine this automatically-collected information with other information we collect about you. If you reach out to us over the telephone, facsimile, email, our contact form on our website or via any other mechanism, we may also log telephony information such as your phone number, forwarding calls, SMS routing information and types of calls and other details of your communications to us for us to respond to your questions, improve our products and services and to develop new products and services.</li></ul><h4>Use of Personal Data Collected</h4><p>We may use personal data collected from or about you for any of the following purposes:</p><ul class="c-content-list-1 c-theme c-separator-dot c-margin-l-20 c-font-thin"><li>Consumer personal data. Comm100 uses Consumer personal data to provide the Comm100 Services requested by Consumers and/or contracted for by Organizations, including transmitting Consumer personal data from Comm100 software to applications used by the Organization. We also use Consumer information to provide support for Organizations. For example, a reservation requested by a Consumer through Comm100 Live Chat may cause Consumer personal data to be transmitted to a reservation management system of a Hotel through Webhooks to finalize the reservation and enable the Hotel to provide services to the Consumer.</li><li>To respond to your requests or to tailor content. We may use your personal data to respond to your requests or the requests of Organizations and Users, which may include processing orders, sending confirmations, providing invoices, responding to requests for information about our products and services, assisting you in downloading resources or product demonstrations or evaluations. We may also use your personal data to customize your interaction with our website and our Services and to provide you with more relevant information regarding our products or services.</li><li>To provide services to you. We may communicate with you about our Services. These may include reports, consulting, services (including without limitation education, training, maintenance and support) for which you have inquired or contracted. For instance, as part of support services, our technical staff may require access to user data to troubleshoot.

Comm100’s Services are used to assist Organizations in communication between its agents and the Consumers. But in some situations, Organizations and its agents may use a feature of Comm100’s Services that involves a third party, which may result in the transmission of Consumer personal data to that third party. (A very common example is when an Organization uses Webhooks to automatically push such Information into a reservation software system hosted by a third party company. Another example is when an Organization uses Salesforce Integration feature to transfer information between Comm100 Services and Salesforce. ) Users and Organizations should carefully consider the privacy policy and practices of such third parties before using such a feature and instructing Comm100 to transfer the Consumer personal data. It is the responsibility of the Organization to enter into contractual arrangements to comply with all applicable privacy and data security laws and to ensure that the third party provides appropriate privacy and data security protections.</li><li>Business partners and subcontractors. Comm100 may disclose personal data to business partners and subcontractors (such as resellers, vendors, suppliers and other service providers), who may use the information solely at Comm100’s direction, including without limitation to fulfill product orders, contact you about product orders or in connection with the performance, operation, and support of the Services or solutions, performing marketing or consulting services, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. For example, Comm100 currently works with service providers for cloud computing, co-location, project management, data storage, email marketing, search engine optimization and related services among others. Further, we may disclose personal data to service providers who host or facilitate the delivery of online training, seminars and webinars; email-delivery services and other technology providers; and third parties that may assist in the delivery of marketing materials, technical support services, or other products, services or other information. These companies are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide these services.</li><li>Third party analytics providers. Comm100 may disclose User and Comm100 Business personal data to third parties who conduct marketing studies and data analytics, including those that provide tools or code which facilitates our review and management of our Services, such as Google Analytics or similar software products from other providers. For example, we use Google Analytics to analyze site traffic to our website. For more information about how Google collects and processes data when you visit websites or use apps that use Google technologies, please see “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” at <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners" class="c-font-green">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>.</li><li>Transfer or assignment in connection with business transfers or bankruptcy. In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your personal data and other information we have collected from users of the Services to third parties. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, or as otherwise agreed to by you, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information will be subject to this Policy.
