<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">This
Privacy Policy was last updated on May 1, 2019.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">SamacSys,
Ltd. (“SamacSys,” “we,” or “us”) takes the privacy and protection of personal
information very seriously. By visiting and using the SamacSys Offerings or
registering for the SamacSys Offerings and creating an Account, you acknowledge
that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy
(“Privacy Policy”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall
have the meanings assigned to such terms in the SamacSys Terms of Service that
you can find at https://componentsearchengine.com/TermsOfUse.html and which incorporate
this Privacy Policy by reference.</span></p>



<p><b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">What
This Privacy Policy Covers</span></b></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">This
Privacy Policy describes SamacSys’s practices with respect to Personal
Information and Anonymous Information that we collect when you use the SamacSys
Offerings. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal
Information that is collected by third parties that SamacSys does not own or
control or that do not support SamacSys in providing the SamacSys Offerings.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">“Personal
Information” is information that is personally identifiable like names,
addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public
information that is associated with the foregoing.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">“Anonymous
Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your
Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification
of individual persons.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">We
collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in
this Privacy Policy from users of the SamacSys Offerings (“Users”).</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">BY
USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU
EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO
THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS
WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING
PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR
COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE
SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.</span></p>



<p><b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">General
Information</span></b></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">As
a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any
Personal Information hereunder is entirely voluntary; there are generally no
detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Information.
However, there are circumstances in which SamacSys cannot take action without
certain Personal Information, for example because this Personal Information is
required to process your orders or provide you with access to a web offering or
newsletter. In these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for SamacSys
to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Information.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">As
part of a global group of companies, SamacSys has affiliates and third-party
service providers within, as well as outside of, the European Economic Area
(the “EEA”). As a consequence, whenever SamacSys is using or otherwise
processing your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy
Statement, SamacSys may transfer your Personal Information to countries outside
of the EEA including to such countries in which a statutory level of data
protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection
within the EEA. Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard
Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any
future replacement) in order to contractually provide that your Personal Information
is subject to a level of data protection that applies within the EEA. </span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">You
can request from SamacSys at any time details about which Personal Information SamacSys
processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Information.
Please note, however, that SamacSys can delete your Personal Information only
if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of SamacSys to retain
it. If you request that SamacSys delete your Personal Information, you will not
be able to continue to use any SamacSys service that requires SamacSys’s use of
your Personal Information.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">If
SamacSys uses your Personal Information based on your consent or to perform a
contract with you, you may further request from SamacSys a copy of the Personal
Information that you have provided to SamacSys. In this case, please contact
the email address below and specify the information or processing activities to
which your request relates, the format in which you would like this
information, and whether the Personal Information is to be sent to you or
another recipient. SamacSys will carefully consider your request and discuss
with you how we can best fulfill it.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Furthermore,
you can request from SamacSys that we restrict your Personal Information from
any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the
Personal Information SamacSys has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long
as SamacSys requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Information),
(ii) there is no legal basis for SamacSys processing your Personal Information and
you demand that SamacSys restricts your Personal Information from further processing,
(iii) SamacSys no longer requires your Personal Information but you claim that
you require SamacSys to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal
rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to
the processing of your Personal Information by SamacSys (based on SamacSys’s
legitimate interest as further set out below) for as long as it is required to
review as to whether SamacSys has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in
processing your Personal Information.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Please
direct any such request to legal@SamacSys.com.</span></p>

To Lodge A Complaint</span></b></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">If
you believe that SamacSys is not processing your Personal Information in
accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data
protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection
authority of the EEA country in which you live or with the data protection
authority of the country or state in which SamacSys has its registered seat.</span></p>

and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws of
various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union
and its member states, and of the United States of America. You acknowledge
that, pursuant to the applicable export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes
issued by these countries, SamacSys is required to take measures to prevent
entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued
sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and

This may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out

<p><b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Uses
Of My Personal Information Based On My Consent</span></b></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In
the following cases SamacSys will only use your Personal Information as further
detailed below after you have granted your prior consent into the relevant
processing operations. </span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">SamacSys
may provide a hashed user ID to third party operated social networks or other
web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or Google) where
this information is then matched against the social networks’ data or the web
offerings’ own data bases in order to display to you more relevant information.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">SamacSys
offers you the option to use its Offerings including forums, blogs, and
networks linked to its Sites that require you to register and create a user
profile. User profiles provide the option to display personal information about
you to other users, including but not limited to your name, photo, social media
accounts, postal or email address, or both, telephone number, personal
interests, skills, and basic information about your company.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">These
profiles may relate to a single Offering of SamacSys or may also allow you to
access other Offerings of SamacSys or of other entities of SamacSys, or both
(irrespective of any consent granted under the section “Forwarding Your
Personal Data To Other SamacSys Companies.” below). It is, however, always your
choice which of these additional Offerings you use and your Personal Information
is only forwarded to them once you initially access them. Kindly note that
without your consent for SamacSys to create such user profiles, SamacSys will
not be in a position to offer such services to you where your consent is a
statutory requirement that SamacSys can provide these services to you.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Within
any Offerings, beyond the mere provision of access, your profile is used to
personalize interaction with other users (for example, by way of messaging or
follow functionality) and by SamacSys to foster the quality of communication
and collaboration through such Offerings and for SamacSys to provide gamification
elements (gamification is the process of taking something that already exists,
such as a website, an enterprise application, or an online community, and
integrating game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, and
loyalty). To the greatest extent supported by the relevant Offerings, you can
use the functionality of the relevant Offerings to determine which information
you want to share.</span></p>



<p><i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Special
categories of Personal Information.</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"> In connection with the
registration for and provision of access to an event or seminar, SamacSys may
ask for information about your health for the purpose of identifying and being
considerate of individuals who have disabilities or special dietary
requirements throughout the event. Any such use of information is based on the
consent you grant hereunder.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Kindly
note that if you do not provide any such information about disabilities or
special dietary requirements, SamacSys will not be able to take any respective
precautions.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">If
you register for an event, seminar, or webinar of SamacSys, SamacSys may share
basic participant information (your name, company, and email address) with
other participants of the same event, seminar, or webinar for the purpose of
communication and the exchange of ideas.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">SamacSys
may transfer your Personal Information to other entities owned by SamacSys. In
such cases, these entities will then use the Personal Information for the same
purposes and under the same conditions as outlined in this section.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">You
may at any time withdraw a consent granted. &nbsp;In case of withdrawal, SamacSys
will not process Personal Information subject to this consent any longer unless
legally required to do so. In case SamacSys is required to retain your Personal
Information for legal reasons your Personal Information will be restricted from
further processing and only retained for the term required by law. However, any
withdrawal has no effect on past processing of Personal Information by SamacSys
up to the point in time of your withdrawal. Furthermore, if your use of an SamacSys
Offering requires your prior consent, SamacSys will not be (any longer) able to
provide the relevant service, offer or event to you after your revocation.</span></p>
