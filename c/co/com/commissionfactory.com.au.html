    <h1>We feel that privacy is an issue these days and we endeavour to never unnecessarily store any private data on our clients and will NEVER expose or sell our data. </h1>

    <br>

    <p>The defined terms in this Policy have the same meaning as in our Terms of Use, which You should read together with this Policy. By accessing our Website and using our Service, You consent to the terms of this Policy and agree to be bound by it and our Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory collects Your personal information
    </h2>

    </ul>
    <p>You can always choose not to provide Your personal information to Commission Factory, but it may mean that we are unable to provide You with the Service.</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory may receive personal information from You about others</h2>

    <p>Through Your use of the Service, Commission Factory may also collect information from You about someone else. If You provide Commission Factory with personal information about someone else, You must ensure that You are authorised to disclose that information to Commission Factory and that, without Commission Factory taking any further steps required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Commission Factory may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>

    <p>This means that You must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of and/or consents to the various matters detailed in this Policy, including the fact that their personal information is being collected, the purposes for which that information is being collected, the intended recipients of that information, the individual's right to obtain access to that information, Commission Factory’s identity, and how to contact Commission Factory.</p>

    <p>Where requested to do so by Commission Factory, You must also assist Commission Factory with any requests by the individual to access or update the personal information You have collected from them and entered into the Service.</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory collects, holds, and uses Your personal information for limited purposes</h2>

    <p>Commission Factory collects Your personal information so that we can provide You with the Service and any related services You may request. In doing so, Commission Factory may use the personal information we have collected from You for purposes related to the Services including to:</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory can aggregate Your non-personally identifiable data</h2>

    <p>By using the Service, You agree that Commission Factory can access, aggregate and use non-personally identifiable data Commission Factory has collected from You. This data will in no way identify You or any other individual.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>assist us to better understand how our customers are using the Service,</li>
        <li>provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and benefits of the Service,</li>
        <li>enhance business productivity, including by creating useful business insights from that aggregated data and allowing You to benchmark Your campaign performance against that aggregated data, and</li>
        <li>otherwise to improve the Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Commission Factory holds your personal information on servers located in Australia</h2>

    <p>All Data, including personal and non-personal information, that is entered into the Service by You, or automatically imported on Your instruction, is transferred to Commission Factory’s servers as a function of transmission across the Internet. By using the Service, You consent to Your personal information being transferred to our servers as set out in this Policy.</p>

    <p>Currently our servers are located in Australia (AU), primarily by Indigo Solutions Pty Ltd (Indigo), and Your personal information will be routed through, and stored on, those servers as part of the Service. If the location of our servers change in the future, we will update this Policy. You should review our Policy regularly to keep informed of any updates.</p>

    <p>By providing Your personal information to Commission Factory, You consent to Commission Factory storing Your personal information on servers hosted in Australia. While Your personal information will be stored on servers located in Australia, it will remain within Commission Factory’s effective control at all times. The server host’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to Commission Factory, and we’ve taken steps to ensure that our server hosts do not have access to, and use the necessary level of protection for, Your personal information.</p>

    <p>If You do not want Your personal information to be transferred to a server located in Australia, You should not provide Commission Factory with Your personal information or use the Service.</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory takes steps to protect your personal information</h2>

    <p>Commission Factory is committed to protecting the security of Your personal information and we take all reasonable precautions to protect it from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Your personal information is stored on secure servers that have SSL Certificates issued by leading certificate authority DigiCert Inc, and all Data transferred between You and the Service is encrypted.</p>

    <p>However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment and we cannot give an absolute assurance that Your information will be secure at all times. Transmission of personal information over the Internet is at Your own risk and You should only enter, or instruct the entering of, personal information to the Service within a secure environment.</p>

    <p>We will advise You at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of a security breach where Your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorised persons or in any unauthorised manner.</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory only discloses Your Personal Information in limited circumstances</h2>

    <p>Commission Factory will only disclose the personal information You have provided to us to entities outside the Commission Factory group of companies if it is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the purpose for which Your personal information was collected pursuant to this Policy, including the provision of the Service.</p>

    <p>Commission Factory will not otherwise disclose Your personal information to a third party unless You have provided Your express consent. However, You should be aware that Commission Factory may be required to disclose Your personal information without Your consent in order to comply with any court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process or investigation including by tax authorities, if such disclosure is required by law. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify You if we are required by law to disclose Your personal information.</p>

    <p>The third parties who host our servers do not control, and are not permitted to access or use Your personal information except for the limited purpose of storing the information. This means that, for the purposes of Australian privacy legislation and Australian users of the Service, Commission Factory does not currently “disclose” personal information to third parties located overseas.</p>

    <p>Upon receipt of your application to join the Commission Factory service your business details and/or ASIC information may be obtained to do a prior check of the status of your business and verify your operation. Your ABN may also be used with the CreditorWatch service to verify whether you or your company have any outstanding defaults registered.</p>

In some circumstances, it may be necessary for us to seek to arrange access to Your personal information through a mutually agreed intermediary (for example, the Subscriber).</p><p>

    </p><p>We’ll only keep Your personal information for as long as we require it for the purposes of providing You with the Service. However, we may also be required to keep some of Your personal information for specified periods of time, for example under certain laws relating to corporations, money laundering, and financial reporting legislation.</p>

    <h2>Commission Factory uses cookies</h2>

    <p>In providing the Service, Commission Factory utilises "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that is stored on Your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie does not identify You personally or contain any other information about You but it does identify Your computer.</p>
