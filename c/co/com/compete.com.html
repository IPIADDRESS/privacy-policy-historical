      <p>This Privacy Policy (the "policy") outlines the types of personally-identifiable
      information ("personal information") we receive and collect when you

      as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard your personal
      information.</p>

      <p>Compete uses personal information collected through the Services
      for the purposes of:</p>
      <ul style="font-size: 1.1em;">
        <li style="list-style: disc outside none">Providing our products and services to users, including the display of
        customized content, identification and authentication, and contact;</li>
        <li style="list-style: disc outside none">Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve

      </ul>

      <p><b>Questions &amp; Answers:</b></p>

      <p><b>Who is Compete?</b></p>
      <p>
      Compete, a unit of Kantar Media, delivers digital intelligence that helps
      the world’s top brands improve their marketing based on the online behavior
      of millions of consumers. Compete’s products and services are fueled by the
      largest integrated online consumer behavior and survey panel in the industry.
      Digital insights are interpreted by analytical experts in the automotive,
      financial services, media, mobile, online, retail, telecom and travel markets
      to deliver data and recommendations to create effective online experiences
      and highly profitable advertising campaigns. Compete's services are supported
      by industry-leading data management and technology. Our consumer and industry
      data is drawn from numerous sources and comprises the largest continuous
      consumer behavior database in the industry. Our proprietary data
      methodologies and patent-pending technology aggregate, transform and
      normalize this data and ensure it is representative of the entire US online
      marketplace.</p>
      
      <p>Compete processes personal information only for the purposes for which it 
      was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We take reasonable steps 
      to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, 
      and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal 
      information whenever necessary.</p>

      <p><b>What information do we collect at this website?</b></p>
      <p>
      At <b>compete.com</b>, we offer a number of services that do not require you 
      to register for an account
      or provide any personal information to us, such as Compete Site Profiles and
      Comparison. However, some of our Services will require the provision of certain
      personal information. In order to provide our full range of services, we may
      collect the following types of information:</p>
        
      <p><b>Information you provide</b></p>
      <p>When you sign up for a MyCompete account or other Compete services
      or promotions that requires registration, we sometimes ask you for personal
      information (such as your e-mail address and an account password). For certain
      services, such as our premium offerings, we also request credit card or other
      payment account information which will be maintained by third party merchant(s)
      or payment processor(s) in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the
      information you submit under your account with information from other Compete
      services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and
      to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you
      the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</p>
        
        <p>MyCompete member e-mail addresses are used to contact members
        regarding service updates, confirmations, opt-in surveys and select partner
        offers.  If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see the
        Opt-out section within e-mails you receive from us or manage your e-mail
        subscriptions by signing into MyCompete by clicking <a href="https://my.compete.com/account">here</a>.  You may also contact us using
        the contact information listed below.  If you elect to opt-out of further
        communications, such opt-out will apply only to marketing messages and not
        to communications regarding service updates and similar matters.</p>
        <p>Compete Blog e-mail updates are administered by a 3rd party
        service provider.  E-mail addresses provided to them via the automated form
        on the blog are used solely for the purpose of sending you blog alerts.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend that
        you think Compete.com might be of interest to them, we will ask you for
        your friend's name and e-mail address.  We will automatically send your
        friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site.  We store
        this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.  We
        have no intention of annoying you or your friends.  Your friend may contact
        us to request that we remove this information from our database.  Please be
        judicious when providing friends' contact information to our service and do
        not provide us with such information unless you have your friends' consent
        to do so.</p>
        <p>When you contact us via our Contact form, send e-mail or other
        communication to Compete, we may retain those communications in order to
        process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>

      <p><b>Cookies, Beacons and Site Logging</b></p>
      <p>To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology.
      Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive,
      which enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use
      cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to
      assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected
      by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully
      used Compete.com. Cookies are not tied to your personal information.</p>
      
      <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
      Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what
      content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,
      similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web
      users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. We
      also use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the
      recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
      communications.</p>

      <p>When you use Compete services, our servers automatically record
      information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs
      may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser
      type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies
      that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
    
    <p><b>What information does our technology collect?</b></p>
    <p>When you download Compete software, including the Compete Toolbar, you
    will be given the option of enabling click-sharing.  Should you opt-in to
    click-sharing you will begin to anonymously share the addresses of the web pages
    you visit online.</p>  

    <p>Using the small piece of software you download, we collect information related
    to your website visitation and internet usage. We use this information, in anonymous
    or aggregated fashion, to help our clients understand what sites, products, and
    services our members interact with. The small piece of software uses a proprietary
    rules engine to search through all URLs (internet site addresses), before transmitting
    them to its database, to strip out any such personally identifiable information. If
    any personal information, for ex. something you may have typed into a field on a page,
    inadvertently collected by the software, we make every commercially viable effort to purge
    our database of that information promptly. In any event, we do not disclose the
    contents of such information stored in our databases - so we will not release or use this
    information anyway.</p>

    <p>As a member of the compete.com community you are assigned a randomly generated user
    ID ensuring your anonymity. The only contact information associated with your user
    ID is your registration e-mail, which we only use to send you service updates and other
    requested communications that you have signed up to receive from us.</p>
    
    <p>To calculate more robust metrics for our users, we also license URL and
    demographic data (age, gender, household income, geographical location, etc.) from
    multiple sources including ISPs and ASPs. We honor the privacy of our Members and
    the privacy policies of our licensors and do not knowingly collect or license
    personally identifiable information from members or licensors.  Again, Compete
        aggregates data on multiple users before supplying any data, thereby 
    ensuring an individual's privacy.</p>
    <p>Compete may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of 
    whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the 
    quality of our services.
    </p>
      
  <p>We may use a 3rd party partner for database or software application services 
    (such as customer support, email or survey and for purposes of data quality, data 
    cleansing . In addition, we may occasionally supplement information panel members 
    provide us with public information (such as demographic information, ownership 
    information or similar) available through third parties. In all cases, we ensure 
    your privacy by having these third parties sign a written, legally binding 
    agreement stipulating that they will not share our data with any outside party and 
    that any individual identifying information is to be used solely for the purpose 
    of matching records or providing the agreed upon database service.
    This Policy applies to all information that you provide to Compete.com. However, 
    when you visit websites to which Compete.com links, keep in mind you will be 
    interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security 
    policy. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, 
    the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy 
    policy. A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of 
    cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any 
    other service provider from whom you request services.
  </p>

  <p><b>Are there any other third parties with whom we share your information?</b></p> 
  <p>Compete.com only shares personal information with individuals outside of 
  Compete as disclosed in the compete.com  Privacy Policy and in the following limited 
  circumstances:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;font-size: 1.1em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good faith 
    belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of information is reasonably 
    necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable 
    governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including 
    investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise 
    address fraud, security or technical issues, (d) protect against imminent harm to 
    the rights, property or safety of Compete, its users or the public as required or 
    permitted by law, (e) allow service providers and/or vendors to fulfill Services 
    for you on behalf of Compete or (f) pursuant to an acquisition, merger, sale of 
    assets or other business transfer.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><b>What is our policy regarding children's privacy?</b></p>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Compete services. We do not knowingly 
    collect or use personal information about visitors under 13 years of age. If you are 
    under 13 years of age, you can use the services offered on our website only in 
    conjunction with your parents or guardians.</p>

  <p><b>What security measures do we have in place to ensure that your data is kept securely?</b></p>    
  <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to 
    or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information. 
    These measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and 
    processing practices and security practices.</p>

  <p>We restrict access to personal information to Compete employees, contractors 
    and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop 
    or improve our services. We take reasonable efforts to ensure all parties 
    comply with confidentiality obligations.</p>
      
    <p>We store all personal information on our servers in the United States of America.</p>

  <p><b>How would we inform you if our privacy practices change?</b></p>
  <p>Please note that this policy may change from time to time. We will post any

    not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by 
    Internet or by fax at 415-520-3420, or mail at Watchdog Complaints, TRUSTe, 
    55 2nd Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA, USA 94105. If you are faxing 
    or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following 
    information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your 
    contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your 
    complaint shared with the company. For information about TRUSTe or the
