<h2>Commission River Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>CommissionRiver.com is a web site that is owned and operated by Commission River, Inc. 
and owned subsidiary of <a href="http://www.bayhillcapital.com">Bayhill Capital</a> OTC BB: BHYL</p>

<p>Our mailing address is:<br>
12401 South 450 East, Suite D1<br>
Draper, UT 84062</p>

<h5>Privacy</h5>

<p>Commission River, Inc. ("CommissionRiver.com" or "we" or "us") uses this web site to run an affiliate marketing network 
over 
the World Wide Web (the "Web"). Even though Many portions of this web site are accessible and viewable by the general public, 
not all visitors may use our program. Each Commission River program is available for use only by persons or entities that join 
the network as either an "Affiliate" (Publisher), an "Advertiser" (Vendor), or "Strategic Partner" (Private Labeled Licensee). 
</p>

<h5>Information About Affiliates</h5>

<p>When we receive a request to become a Commission River affiliate, that information is not shared with any third party for 
any 
reason. That information is used strictly for login security (when the affiliate accesses their password protected back 
office), tracking the sign up of new customers, and for payment of commissions. All affiliates have the ability to apply for 
all advertising programs offered without their individual information being shared in any way with our advertising 
partners.</p>

<h5>Information About Advertisers</h5>

<p>Commission River advertisers are required to submit their contact and billing information to us when they apply to become 
listed in our program. Once approved, the Commission River team will build their products and/or services into our program and 
make them available to the community of affiliates. Commission River sends all new customer information (generated by 
affiliate traffic) directly to these advertisers for provisioning. Once the transaction in complete, the advertiser will pay 
Commission River for the sale. Commission River, in turn, pays the affiliate. The customer's private information never leaves 
this information loop.</p>

<h5>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h5>

<p>Commission River reserves the right to modify or replace this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice to or the 
consent of any person. Any changes or replacement will be posted on this site.</p>

<h5>Questions and Comments About Our Privacy Policy</h5>

<p>Persons already enrolled as an Advertiser in one of our Programs who have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy 
or 
the relevant provisions of their Advertiser Agreements should contact the Director of Commission River, Robert Probst using 
the "Contact Us" link.</p>
