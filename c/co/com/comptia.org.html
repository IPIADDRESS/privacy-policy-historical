                  <p><strong>How CompTIA Uses Information</strong><br>
                    We use the information you submit or otherwise provide about 
                    yourself on our Web site for the purpose of completing your 
                    request or order. We also use such information to provide 
                    you, or have our business partners provide you, with updates 
                    and other information that we think may be of interest to 
                    you. By submitting or otherwise providing information on our 
                    Web site, you are authorizing CompTIA and its affiliates and 
                    business partners to collect, save, transmit, transfer, use, 
                    deliver and otherwise process such information for marketing, 
                    administration, statistical analysis, research, promotions 
                    and other purposes deemed necessary or appropriate by CompTIA, 
                    including, without limitation, transmitting or otherwise transferring 
                    such information outside the country or geographic region 
                    in which you reside. By submitting or otherwise providing 
                    information on our Web site, you are authorizing CompTIA and 
                    its affiliates to send you, and to have our business partners 
                    send you, news, announcements and other promotional communications 
                    via facsimile, e-mail and telephone. </p>
                  <p>Except as noted in this Privacy Statement, we do not share 
                    the information you submit or otherwise provide about yourself 
                    on our Web site with third parties unless it is necessary 
                    to complete your request or order, it is necessary to provide 
                    a product or service to you, or we want to provide you, or 
                    have our business partners provide you, with updates and other 
                    information that we think may be of interest to you. We will 
                    also share such information with third parties if it is necessary 
                    to protect our rights or property or if it is required by 
                    law. We may not control the use or disclosure of such information 
                    by any third parties.</p>
                  <p>We use return e-mail addresses to respond to e-mail inquiries 
                    and to confirm orders or registrations. Except as noted in 
                    this Privacy Statement, such addresses are not used for any 
                    other purpose and are not shared with third parties. We never 
                    use or share the personally identifiable information provided 
                    to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above 
                    without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise 
                    prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we use non-identifying and aggregate information 
                    to better design our Web site and to share with advertisers. 
                    For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals 
                    visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of 
                    men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, 
                    but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify 
                    those individuals, except as noted in this Privacy Statement.</p>
                  <p><strong>Registrations for Events, Seminars and Conferences</strong><br>
                    To the extent that you submit or otherwise provide information 
                    on our Web site for the purpose of registering for any event, 
                    seminar or conference, such information (other than any credit/debit 
                    card information) may be shared with other attendees, sponsors 
                    and/or exhibitors at such event, seminar or conference for 
                    networking and other promotional purposes. Such information 
                    may be used or publicly disclosed by such attendees, sponsors 
                    and exhibitors in their discretion. We do not control the 
                    use or disclosure of such information by such attendees, sponsors 
                    and exhibitors. </p>
                  <p><strong>Opt-Out Policy</strong><br>
                    If you would like to opt-out of the sharing of your personally 
                    identifiable information submitted on our Web site with third 
                    parties, <a href="mailto:loginquestions@comptia.org">contact 
                    us</a> and indicate your unwillingness to share such information 
                    with third parties. </p>
                  <p>If you would like to opt-out of receiving any direct marketing 
                    information from us, <a href="mailto:loginquestions@comptia.org">contact 
                    us</a> and indicate that you do not consent to the use by 
                    CompTIA of your personally identifiable information for marketing 
                    purposes.</p>
                  <p><strong>Links</strong><br>
                    Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites. Please 
                    be aware that this Privacy Statement does not apply to such 
                    linked sites nor is CompTIA responsible for the content or 
                    privacy practices of such linked sites. </p>
                  <p><strong>“Cookies”</strong><br>
                    Like most Web sites , CompTIA uses “cookies” for 
                    several legitimate purposes. These include remembering IDs 
                    and passwords, tracking user traffic patterns, and differentiating 
                    between repeat and new users. It is CompTIA’s policy 
                    that data generated by cookies will be used for internal purposes 
                    only and to improve our Web site and site-related services. 
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Amendments</strong><br>
                    CompTIA may amend this Privacy Statement from time to time. 
                    Any such amendments will be posted on our Web site. </p>
                  <p><strong>Inquiries or Complaints</strong><br>
