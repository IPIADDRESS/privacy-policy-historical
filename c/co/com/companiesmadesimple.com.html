I think what you do is fantastic, especially for my needs I wasn't too fussed about getting a certificate directly from Companies House as the PDF via email sufficed for my needs and it was so quick. I'd been to a few people who wanted to charge silly amounts but the form was straight forward and I am quite capable if completing such a form. Also you offered cashback too which for a small and new business was an added bonus. NB. On your form you should have option for n/a as some questions do not apply. I scored a 3 for those as I didn't have the need to contact customer services.<br>

What a breath of fresh air it was to work with such a professional company that allowed us to get up and running within a matter of days. It was easy, simple and extremely cost effective. Being from the United States, I had no idea where to even start. After your staff walked me through the process step by step, I was able to understand exactly what needed to be done in order to get up and running. I had my company opened and incorporated in just a matter of days. I would recommend your services to anyone looking for a fast and cost effective solution to forming a company in the UK.<br>
