I like the fact you explain technical jargon and give the average company newbie (me) everything we require in a stylish but simple style. Good work and thank you for making this a painless experience for me!<br>

Excellent Job! The service was ordered yesterday and woke up to the company being incorporated! Incorporating the American company in the UK was so easy and the value was extraordinarily high for the money. The Reserve a Name/Dormant Company Service was perfect for securing a company name. Thank you Companies Made Simple Ltd.!<br>

I think what you do is fantastic, especially for my needs I wasn't too fussed about getting a certificate directly from Companies House as the PDF via email sufficed for my needs and it was so quick. I'd been to a few people who wanted to charge silly amounts but the form was straight forward and I am quite capable if completing such a form. Also you offered cashback too which for a small and new business was an added bonus. NB. On your form you should have option for n/a as some questions do not apply. I scored a 3 for those as I didn't have the need to contact customer services.<br>
