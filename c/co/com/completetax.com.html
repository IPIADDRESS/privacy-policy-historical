            <br>
            <p>When transmitting information between you and our server, as well as when communicating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for electronic filing, data security is handled through a protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is an established and mature Internet security standard with two dominant features: data encryption and web server authentication.</p>

              <span class="title3">Data Encryption</span> 
              <br />
              <p>Data encryption is the process of transforming legible information into a complex arrangement of illegible information. SSL uses a private/public key combination to encrypt data when it is sent and to decrypt data when it is received. SSL encrypts data using a mathematical formula, also referred to as a "key."</p> 
              <p>Encryption strength is measured by the length of the key used to encrypt the data; the longer the key, the more effective the encryption. Using the SSL protocol, data transmission between you and our web server is performed at a standard level of encryption strength.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="title3">Web Server Authentication</span> 
              <br />
              <p>An SSL certificate is issued to ensure authentic and accurate identification of a secured web server. This translates into a digital ID, an electronic fingerprint, which is included in the key used to encrypt the data. Only our web server, in this case, is able to decrypt the data that you transmit because it is the intended (and digitally certified) secured web server for this data transmission.</p>

            <p>The tax return information that we collect is used strictly for lawful purposes and is never shared with Federal, State or other taxing authorities without your consent. The foregoing notwithstanding, we reserve the right to disclose your information without your consent as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, in response to a court order, legal process served on our Web site, subpoena, search warrant or other inquiry or request from governmental or regulatory authorities, or to protect against fraud or other criminal activities. If you choose to electronically file your return, we will transmit your tax return to the appropriate Federal and State taxing authorities. </p>
            <p>The IRS requires us to provide the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated, as well as the e-mail address of the person who electronically filed the return. This information is sent to the IRS at the time you choose to submit your return to the IRS for electronic filing.</p>
            <p>In order to electronically file your return, we must share your submitted tax information with the appropriate tax authorities in order to complete your request. You can control whether or not you wish your tax information shared for this purpose by deciding whether or not to complete the tax return forms, which are all clearly labeled.</p>
            <p>The above listed credit card information that we collect will be used strictly for order processing and billing purposes, and will not be shared with any other party other than the credit card processing company and the IRS in order to implement your direct deposit request. When appropriate, bank account or credit card information is also passed to our bank, for processing purposes, if you choose to use our Credit Card Payment of Balance Due or Deduct Fee from Refund options. You will enter this information during the routine course of a purchase. In the event that our Internet Service staff should need to research and resolve any status or billing issues associated with an order, the information will only be accessed by authorized personnel. </p>
            <p>Our Basic Service entitles you to notification via e-mail of filing deadlines, estimate reminders, tax law changes, as well as tax planning and financial information that may affect your tax return. In order for us to provide you with the Basic Service, it is required that you provide us with your e-mail address.</p>
            <p>Personally identifiable information is only shared as indicated in this document or as otherwise consented to by you in writing, subject to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>If you sign up for our newsletter, we will use your email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.
