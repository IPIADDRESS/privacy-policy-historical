<p>A record of the search will appear on your credit report. &nbsp;Some product providers may also carry out checks against data they already hold on you (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums.&nbsp; They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.</p>

					<p>We're no fans of junk email either, which is why we'll only ever send you relevant emails if you tell us that you'd like to receive them.</p>

                <li class="iconC">

                <li class="iconG">
					<h3>Contact with your consent </h3>

					<h3>How we work</h3>
					<p>We work with almost all of the UK's top providers to find you the best deals. We charge partners a fee to appear on <a href="http://www.comparethemarket.com/">comparethemarket.com</a> and our searches don't include every single provider in the market – a very small number opt out of all comparison sites and others do not meet the strict partner criteria we use to protect our customers.</p>

                <li class="iconH">
					<h3>The best deals</h3>
					<p>Most people use comparison websites to get the best deal they can, which is why we’ll never send you irrelevant ‘special deals’. All we do is compare the market for you.&nbsp;</p>
