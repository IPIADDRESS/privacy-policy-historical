	<h3 class="triggerB"><font color="#000000">Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</font></h3>
		<div class="toggle_containerB">
			<div class="block"><font color="#000000">We conduct various contests, sweepstakes and promotions over the air, online and at remote locations. Certain contests, sweepstakes or promotions are only for members of our Loyalty Awards or Membership programs. Depending on the type of contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you will be required to submit your name, age or date of birth, gender, postal address and/or email address.  Additional non-Personal Information may be requested depending on the nature of the activity and such information may be associated with your Personal Information.  If the activity is conducted online, we do not knowingly collect the Personal Information from a person under the age of 13 and we will delete such information, to the extent technically possible, in the event we discover or have knowledge that a child has registered for an online contest, sweepstakes or other promotional activity.  Persons that falsify their contest/sweepstakes entry for any reason will immediately forfeit any prize, benefit or compensation.  
	<br>
	<br>
	For all contests and sweepstakes, you may need to show state-issued identification to verify your identity and eligibility if you are selected to be a winner.  If you win a prize valued at $600 or more, or have won in one calendar year prizes that are valued at $600 or more in the aggregate, you must also provide your social security number and complete the required IRS Form W-9 for federal tax reporting.</font>   </div>

If a specialized feature or website is provided by both LFMC and a LNC Affiliate or a third party, both entities will own and use your Personal Information consistent with their individual privacy policies.
	<br>
	<br>
	We may also provide our users and/or members with the opportunity to weigh-in on local or national issues or share personal interests by participating in a survey or a questionnaire.  We may collect your email address and other information related to the subject matter, such a politics, travel, sports, food, education, or medical information.

	<br>
	<br>
	If you send correspondence to us that pertains to our broadcast operations or programming, we are required by federal law to place all such correspondence in the station’s FCC Public Inspection File, which may also be posted electronically on these Sites.  Please see our section titled “Do we collect Personal Information from or about children?” for details on how we handle such correspondence from children.
	<br>
	<br>
	Our Sites may also enable you to submit Personal Information about other people. We may collect Personal Information about other people from you when you participate in various programs and features or when you submit news stories or nominations for community awards or recognition that involve other people.

<h3 class="trigger">Do we collect Personal Information from or about children?</h3>
<div class="toggle_container">
	<div class="block">
        <font color="#000000">
		We recognize the particular importance of protecting the privacy of children.  We are committed to protecting children’s privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  We do not generally target children for our goods and services and do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us that does not qualify for any regulatory, legal, or security/safety exemption as described below, or we are contacted by a verifiable parent or legal guardian about his or her child’s participation on our Sites, we will delete the Personal Information about the child from our active records and from our systems to the extent technically feasible.   
<br>
<br>
We are required by federal law to place all correspondence from the public related to a station’s operations or programming in the station’s FCC Public Inspection File, which may also be posted electronically on these Sites.  If we know that email or other correspondence is from a child, we cannot delete the correspondence but we reserve the discretion to remove any Personal Information that could be used to contact the child from the correspondence before placing it in the FCC Public inspection File.  
<br>
<br>
On occasion, our Sites may enable parents or legal guardians to submit information about their child under the age of 13 for purposes of participating in programs or features, such as contests.  In such instances, we only request the types of Personal Information necessary for participation in the program, which may include, but is not limited to, the parent’s name and email address, child’s name, age, city, and a photograph of the child.  This information would be used only for purposes of the specific program or feature.</font>

<h3 class="trigger">How do we passively collect and use Personal Information through tracking technology?</h3>
<div class="toggle_container">
	<div class="block">
        <font color="#000000">
		Our Sites passively collect certain kinds of information that reveal the frequency with which you visit our Sites, the times and dates of your visits, the pages you reviewed or searched, your transactions, and other information, including an Internet protocol (IP) address, which is series of numbers that identifies the computer you are using.  Information is passively collected through various means.  We use IP addresses to identify server problems, administer our Sites, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes, and to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your IP address’ geographic location, Site usage, search or transaction history.  We also use navigational data, including log files and click-stream data, to identify information about your web browser and operating system, and the time period in which you visit our Sites or select pages or areas of our Sites.  This information is also used to improve our Sites’ content and is retained anonymously, meaning that it does not identify an individual user.  
<br>
<br>
Our Sites use small text files called “cookies” that are sent to the hard drive of your computer to store bits of information related to your use of our Sites.  Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, shopping cart information and passwords needed to access our Sites.  We may use cookies to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your submitted zip code, age, gender, other demographics, usage, search or transaction history.  You may configure your browser to reject cookies.  If you do so, you might not be able to access important functions or enjoy certain conveniences or customized features of our Sites.
<br>
<br>
Our Sites may also use “web beacons” or other technologies to help personalize your experience, similarly to how we use cookies.  We may also use web beacons and other technologies to gather non-Personal Information about the number of users who visit our Sites, the areas in which they spend their time visiting, and other demographic data.
<br>
<br>
We do not ordinarily combine passively collected Personal Information (as described above) with actively collected Personal Information.  However, for Sites’ interactive features such as blogs, chat rooms and bulletin boards, we have the capability to correlate your comment with your IP address and account in the event you are in violation of the Sites’ <a href="/legal/termsOfUse.aspx">Terms of Use</a> agreement or may be subject to a civil or criminal inquiry or investigation.  We also reserve the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques. The Site may feature advertisements delivered from non-affiliated third parties (such as online ad networks, advertisers, or advertising agencies) who also collect information (including Personal Information) about either your Site visits, searches or transactions or your online activities across the internet through cookies, web beacons and other technologies.  This information is collected to deliver advertisements that are tailored to meet your interests and usage history.  Please understand that LNC does not have access to the information that any such third parties may collect directly from you; the privacy and business practices of such third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
To opt-out of information collected by a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), or to obtain information about the technologies used by NAI or its privacy policy, please click this link: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>
<br>
<br>
If you opt-out of the Site’s, NAI’s or other advertising that is tailored to your interests or usage history, you will continue to receive advertisements on this Site. However, these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.
<br>
<br>
Operational service providers, such as Google, may use cookies and web beacons to help us display customized content and advertising based on your demographics (such as gender, age or city/state), Site visits, searches and purchases.  Google automatically collects information about your browser and computer, including your IP address, Google’s cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the webpage that you request. Google does not disclose your Personal Information to an Advertiser or a third party marketer when you interact with or view a targeted ad.  However, you may chose to accept the Advertiser’s own cookie if you click or interact with an ad.  Google may also combine Personal Information or non-personal information about you that it obtains from us, other business partners, and other companies.</font>
