      <p align="center"><b>Consumer Privacy<br>
      &amp;&nbsp;<br>
      How It Affects You</b></p>
      <p>Since 1855, CompassBank has been guided by the belief that protecting
      each person's right to privacy is fundamental to the quality of customer
      relationships. Although current technology and new marketing practices
      have increased the amount of customer information that can be collected
      and shared in today's marketplace, at CompassBank, we want you to know
      that any personal information about you will be treated with the utmost
      confidence. While some information is critical to providing quality
      service, we recognize that one of our most important assets is our
      customers' trust. Rest assured that safekeeping of customer information
      has always been, and will always remain, a priority for CompassBank.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Information About You</i></b><br>
      <br>
      Information about our customers is accumulated from a variety of sources.
      Some information is provided to CompassBank directly by customers
      themselves. Other data is obtained from outside sources, such as credit
      bureaus. We try to limit the use and collection of information about our
      customers to that which is necessary to administer our business and
      provide superior service, while offering products and services which we
      think will be of interest to customers. We may engage certain third-party
      providers with whom we have agreements (such as data processors,
      debit/credit card providers, check printers, etc.) simply to assist us in
      providing a broader array of financial services, which we might not
      otherwise be in a position to offer you.<br>
      <br>
      Accuracy is important. Our goal is to maintain complete and accurate
      information, such as your home address, tax ID number, account balance,
      etc. Should you ever believe that our records contain inaccurate or
      incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will investigate
      your concerns and make every effort to correct any inaccuracies.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Information Sharing</i></b><br>
      <br>
      It is CompassBank's policy not to reveal specific information about
      customer accounts or other personally identifiable data (non-public
      information) to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use,
      except for the exchange of information with reputable information
      reporting agencies, unless: (1) the customer requests or permits it, or
      (2) the disclosure is required by or allowed by law (e.g. subpoena,
      investigation of fraudulent activity, request by regulator, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      When the bank conducts business with third parties, it requires them to
      maintain similar standards of conduct regarding the privacy of personally
      identifiable customer information provided to them.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Safeguarding Your Information</i></b><br>
      <br>
      At CompassBank, we safeguard information according to established security
      standards and procedures, and we continually assess, upgrade and install
      new technology to protect this information. Employee access to non-public
      customer information is limited to those with a business reason to know
      such information. Employees are trained to understand and comply with this
      privacy policy.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Ending Customer Relationships</i></b><br>
      <br>
      If your customer relationship with us ends, we will treat the information
      we have about you as if you were still our customer.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>To Reach Us</i></b><br>

      information, you may contact us:</p>
