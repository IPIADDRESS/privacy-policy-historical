                                  rewarding online experience. We use your IP address to help diagnose 
                                  problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address 
                                  is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad

                                  in your shopping cart during your website visit. We use cookies to deliver 
                                  content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't 
                                  have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Information collected by 
                                  Cowboom is used for the purposes of processing orders, keeping you 
                                  informed about your order status, for statistical purposes and for 
                                  improving this Cowboom-operated website and its performance. This 
                                  Cowboom-operated website uses secure order forms for customers to request 
                                  information, to trade items, or purchase products. We may request

                                  information (like your credit card information). Contact information 
                                  collected from secure online forms is used to send orders and information 
                                  about our company to our clients and fulfillment partners. Your contact 
                                  information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary. You may 
                                  opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section 
                                  below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for
