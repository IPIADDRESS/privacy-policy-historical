<p>Coca-Cola HBC AG is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to <a href="http://www.coca-colahellenic.com/">www.coca-colahellenic.com</a>&nbsp;and to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. </p>
<p>We provide this Privacy and Cookie Notice to help you to understand what we may do with any personal information that we obtain from you. By providing your personal information to us, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy and Cookie Notice and agree that we may collect, use, and disclose your personal information as described in this Privacy and Cookie Notice.

<h2>What is personal information? </h2>
<p>Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, as defined by applicable law, such as name, e-mail address and telephone number. </p>
<h2>Information that we collect from you </h2>
<p>In general, you can visit this website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. In addition, there are parts of this website where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request and where requested to register you to our website. </p>
<p>We do this through the use of online forms and every time you e-mail us your details. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address. You will find that it is not compulsory to provide us with any additional information we request which is not necessary or reasonable in order to provide you with the services you have requested. We may also collect information about you from e-mails or letters you send to us. </p>
<h2>Use of information collected </h2>
<p>Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve its content. </p>
<p>When other personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is collected from you with your consent (for example, through the use of on-line forms or via e-mail) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. We may also use the personal information you provide or which we collect via this website for the purposes of: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Providing any services that you have requested from us such as to receive Investor Relations information/copies of our Annual Reports, to subscribe to the corporate web-cast service or to subscribe to our e-mail alert service. </li>
    <li>Responding to your inquiries or to process your requests in relation to your information. </li>
    <li>Providing and personalising our services. </li>
    <li>Administering subscription-service records. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please let us know. </p>

<h2>How do I disable/enable cookies?</h2>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled. </p>
<p>There are a number of ways to manage cookies. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

If you use different computers in different locations you will need to ensure that each browser is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences. </p>

<h2>Disclosures </h2>
<p>The information you provide to us will be held on a server in UK and may be accessed by or given to our staff working outside UK and to third parties, to business partners, government bodies and law enforcement agencies, successors in title to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf, some of whom may be located outside the European Economic Area, who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or for other purposes approved by you. </p>
<p>In order to provide our products and services we may, however, need to share your personal information with other companies within the Coca-Cola Hellenic group of companies, and/or third party service providers that process data on our behalf. If you submit personal information to us, you agree to such disclosure. </p>
<p>Since Coca-Cola HBC AG operates globally, we may want to transfer your personal information to other countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). However, while in our control, we always seek to ensure that your personal information receives the same level of protection as it would had it stayed within the EEA, including seeking to ensure that it is kept secure and used only in accordance with our instructions and for the agreed purpose(s). </p>
<p>In particular, please note that if you sign up for our corporate web-cast service, we will ask you to provide your consent to us passing your personal information to our web-cast agency in the USA in order for them to provide you with these services on our behalf. All of the parties mentioned above process information, fulfill and deliver orders and provide support services on our behalf. We may also pass aggregate information on the usage of our site to third parties but this will not include information that can be used to identify you. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request from a regulator or any other legal process served on us. </p>
<p>Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent. </p>
<p>Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners. </p>
<p>Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your consent. </p>

<p>If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent's or guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to us. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information. </p>
<h2>Other websites </h2>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy and Cookie Notice. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their Privacy Policies, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to read the privacy and cookie notices and terms and conditions of any linked, referenced, or interfacing websites you enter.</p>
<h2>Security of information collected and data retention </h2>
<p>We employ strict physical, electronic, and administrative security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorized persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage both on-line and off-line. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires. </p>
