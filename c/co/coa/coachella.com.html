			<br>
			The personally identifiable information we collect is used to facilitate 
			delivery of products and/or services to our customers. In the process of 
			providing these products and/or services, we require our customers to provide 
			certain personally identifiable information. Specific details may include, 
			but is not limited to the following and may be subject to change:<br>
			<br>
			* In the case of contests, promotions, and/or newsletter registrations: 
			We require all users and/or customers wishing to participate in any of our 
			contests, drawings, sweepstakes, promotions, or newsletters to complete 
			a Participant Registration Form. During this registration process we generate 
			and collect certain personally identifiable information. <br>
			<br>
			* The personally identifiable information that may be collected from our 
			customers in completion of a registration form: Customer's first name, last 
			name, zip code, phone number, age and email address. Winners of contests, 
			drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional 
			personally identifiable information such as a shipping address and telephone 
			number. <br>
			<br>
			* In the case of product and/or service purchases: In order to complete 
			the purchase of a product and/or service, an online credit card transaction 
			is required. During this process we generate and collect certain verifiable 
			personally identifiable information. <br>
			<br>
			* The personally identifiable information that may be collected from our 
			customers in completion of a product and/or service purchase: The verifiable 
			personally identifiable information required includes the customer's first 
			and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card 
			billing address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, customer's 
			shipping address, phone number, and email address. <br>
			<br>
			* If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, 
			we may collect such information into a file specific to you.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">How 
			is the information collected</span><br>
			<br>
			We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, 
			including but not limited to those described below:<br>
			<br>
			* Registration<br>
			You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personally 
			identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and 
			password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose 
			to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, 
			Fantasy or other subscription based services. <br>
			<br>
			* Newsletters and Site Emails<br>
			We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site, 
			about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners 
			and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering 
			for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or 
			membership for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your 
			free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site 
			or, in some instances, in the designated area of certain newsletters or 
			emails. <br>
			<br>
			* Contests or Sweepstakes<br>
			We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require 
			registration. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact 
			you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related 
			purposes. We may ask your permission to allow us to post publicly some of 
			your information on the Site, such as on a winners page, in the event you 
			win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will 
			not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a 
			third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes 
			on the Site, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are 
			not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we have no control 
			over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the advertiser's 
			or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before 
			participating. <br>
			<br>
			* Surveys or Voting<br>
			From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from 
			you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will 
			have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At 
			times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. <br>
			<br>
			* Cookies<br>
			As with many Websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," 
			which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you 
			allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your 
			Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the 
			Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. 
			By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which 
			areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the 
			Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, 
			among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies 
			may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest 
			to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, 
			you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies 
			off in your browser; however, some areas of the Site may not provide you 
			with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. 
			<br>
			* IP Addresses and Click-stream Data<br>
			We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system 
			administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and 
			sponsors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
			computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer 
			by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers 
			log your IP address. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers 
			when you request Web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include 
			such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, 
			the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other 
			such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze 
			how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what 
			type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of 
			content and advertising, and the like. <br>
			<br>
			* Transaction Information<br>
			If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products or subscribe 
			for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete 
			an order form that will request certain information from you, including 
			financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and 
			general contact, billing and shipping information. We will use this information 
			to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the 
			information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. 
			Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your 
			protection. <br>
			<br>
			* Fantasy Games<br>
			When you register to play Fantasy games, you may be asked to provide personally 
			identifiable information.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">How we use 
			the information we collect</span><br>
			<br>
			We internally use personally identifiable information about our customers 
			to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze 
			site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize 
			our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve 
			our site and provide better service to our customers. <br>
			<br>
			We may occasionally use a customer's email address and, in rare situations 
			mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative 
			matters or notices.<br>
			<br>
			We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve 
			disputes and troubleshoot problems.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">With 
			whom the information may be shared</span><br>
			<br>
			Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending 
			upon the project for which the information was originally collected, the 
			terms of that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer 
			has opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from Coachella , its 
			affiliated properties, and our promotional partners based on the information 
			you have provided us. In addition, we may provide information we collect 
			about you with third party companies regarding promotions, sweepstakes and 
			other opportunities / offers. These third parties are subject to stringent 
			data security and confidentiality requirements.<br>
			<br>
			While we believe this disclosure of your information will result in opportunities 
			that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give 
			your information to any third party. If you want Coachella to keep all of 
			your information we have collected confidential and not share it with any 
			third party, please either email us or mail your written request to:<br>

			<span class="white11highlight">What choices do I have about 
			Coachella collecting, using, and sharing my information</span><br>
			<br>
			It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally 
			identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally 
			identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect 
			your information -- to limit e-mail communications from Coachella and from 
			our third-party partners. You can request at any time that Coachella not 
			send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication 
			or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:internetpolicy@AEG-la.com" target="_self">internetpolicy@AEG-la.com</a>. 
			Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected 
			through technology -- though some of our features won't work if you decide 
			to do this.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">What security precautions 
			are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your 
			information</span><br>
			<br>
			We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your 
			personally identifiable information. However, please keep in mind that "perfect 
			security" does not exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide Web.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards</span><br>
			<br>
			The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its 
			users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using 
			these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information 
			online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages 
			from other parties. Coachella cannot ensure the security of any information 
			you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, 
			we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available 
			information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding 
			to disclose personal information in these areas.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">Links 
			to other Websites</span><br>
			<br>
			You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed 
			to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" 
			on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site 
			onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors 
			and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. 
			These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect 
			data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published 
			privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you 
			should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal 
			information.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">A special note for parents 
			concerning privacy</span><br>
			<br>
			We do not encourage children to participate in providing us with any personally 
			identifiable information. We ask that children (12 years of age and under) 
			do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor under the 
			age of 13 years, please use our services only under the approval and supervision 
			of your parents or legal guardian(s). <br>
			<br>
			We support the guidelines and regulatory requirements provided in the Children's 
			Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html" target="_blank" class="white11blue">www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html</a><br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">Limitation of Liability</span><br>
			<br>
			By providing us with any personal information you expressly and unconditionally 
			release and hold harmless Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc., Coachella 
			LLC, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees and 
			agents from any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any 
			kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected 
			personal information. In addition, while Coachella takes efforts to ensure 
			the proper and appropriate use of Coachella data provided by Coachella to 
			third party companies, promotional partners or vendors, Coachella is not 
			liable for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection 
			with the use and/or misuse of your collected personal information by Coachella 
			or the above-mentioned non-Coachella entities.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">Notification 
			of changes and acceptance of the Privacy Policy</span><br>
			<br>
			By using this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy 
			policy. Coachella may change this policy from time to time. If so, any such 
			changes will be posted on this page, so that Coachella may keep its users 
			informed of its information collection practices. Accordingly, we recommend 
			that you consult this page frequently so that you are aware of our latest 
			policy. Your continued use of the Site shall constitute your acceptance 
			of such revised privacy policy.<br>
			<br>
			<span class="white11highlight">Correcting 
			and updating personal information</span><br>
			<br>
			If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), 
			or if you no longer desire to access our Site, we will endeavor to provide 
			a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you have provided to 
			us. This can be done by making changes to your profile, by using an option 
			out message in an email, or by emailing us at internetpolicy@AEG-la.com. 
			Please click here to make any changes to your profile and/or opt out of 
			Coachella.<br>

			or concerns about this privacy policy</span><br>

			site, or your dealings with this site, please contact Coachella by sending
