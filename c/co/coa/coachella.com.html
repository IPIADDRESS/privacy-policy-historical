<h3><span id="cookies-tracking-and-interest-based-advertising">Cookies, tracking, and interest-based advertising</span></h3>
<p>Our Digital Services may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar digital tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your hard drive when you visit a website if your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies.&nbsp; Cookies may enable us to recognize your computer, store your preferences and settings, enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform searches and analytics and assist with security administrative functions.. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email. The request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information.&nbsp; Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information such as ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Digital Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We may also use these automated technologies to collect and analyze other non-personal information related to the devices you use to access the Digital Services, such as IP addresses, browser types, browser language, unique device identifiers and other information about your computer(s) and/or mobile device(s). &nbsp;Some tracking technologies on our Digital Services may be provided by a third party (which may be collecting information on its own behalf, or may be providing such information to us).&nbsp; Please note: some cookies/other technologies may track your activities not only on our Digital Services, but on third party sites you visit after you leave our Digital Services, and some services may aggregate this information collected from many sites into a single profile. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>Our Digital Services may use cookies or other technologies provided by website analytics services such as Google Analytics to help us better understand how our Digital Services are used. By tracking how and when you use our Digital Services, these technologies help us determine which features and content on our Digital Services are most important to our visitors. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide a personalized or user-friendly experience. To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>, or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">Google Analytics Opt-out</a>.</p>
<p>Data about your activities online may be collected either by us, our affiliates, or third parties, for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content. You may or may not be offered a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose. The information collected may include information about your visits to our Digital Services, such as the pages you have viewed. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Digital Services and on third-party websites or services that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we disclaim all liability in connection therewith. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Digital Services.

<h3><span id="automatic-collection-when-you-access-our-digital-services"><strong><em>Automatic collection when you access our Digital Services</em></strong></span></h3>
<p>Our Digital Services automatically collect certain information from you when you use them. For example, some of our Digital Services use cookies and other similar tracking technologies to provide essential features and improve your experience when using our Digital Services (see below for more information). Additionally, through our Digital Services, our servers or networks may collect your device’s IP address and other device or network information, such as your screen resolution, OS version, browser version, and certain identifiers. We use this information to help ensure that our content is displayed properly, so that we can understand how, where and which devices access our Digital Services, and to improve the quality and delivery of our Digital Services.</p>
<p>We may log click-stream or similar data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Digital Services, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and other uses related to the Digital Services. Click-stream data is information collected when you request pages from our Digital Services, and may include information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, what you clicked on in order to arrive at our Site, and other non-Personal Information. This data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at our Digital Services, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of events, content, advertising, and the like. We may associate click-stream, shopping cart, ticket purchase (whether complete or incomplete) and other similar data with other information we hold about you so that we can personalize or improve the relevance and quality of the services or information provided.</p>
<h3><span id="when-you-access-our-wifi-on-premise-network">When you access our wifi on-premise network</span></h3>
<p>As part of our effort to provide an unparalleled customer experience, we may provide on-premise wifi for use by our guests. This wifi network is provided on our behalf by a third party service provider, which may request your email address in order to access the wifi service. When you use the wifi network, our service provider may collect information included in http headers and other common routing, device and network information such as your: MAC address; IP address; the model/version of your device and associated hardware and software (including your browser, OS, and other applications); URL requests sent over HTTP; the domains you access; mobile app servers with which you connect; as well as other unique identifiers used to determine whether you are a unique or return user, and other information about your use of the wifi network. The service provider may share with us a list of such information in raw or aggregate form. We and our service provider may use this information to: understand the usage dynamics of the service; to improve the quality of service and for other network/performance management functions; and to determine which sites and applications are most used by our guests. Further, we may use any such information as part of our marketing and promotional activities, including by linking such information to other information we may hold about you.</p>
<p>Our wifi network is public and unencrypted. Use of this network is AT YOUR OWN RISK, as described further in the <a href="https://www.coachella.com/knowledge-base/wifi-terms-of-use/">Wifi Access Terms of Use</a>. ANY WIFI NETWORK THAT DOES NOT LINK TO THIS POLICY IS NOT OWNED AND OPERATED BY US OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDER, AND THIS POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE NETWORKS. ALWAYS USE CAUTION WHEN CONNECTING TO PUBLIC WIFI NETWORKS.</p>
<p>Please note, we do not collect the contents of the communications you send or relating to activity within the applications you use. You may be able to limit the information you make available through the use of encryption, for example, by connecting through a VPN or over HTTPS. By using our wireless network, you consent to our collection of the information described in this section. If you do not consent, you may not use our on-premise wifi network.</p>
<h3><span id="location-tracking"><em>Location tracking</em></span></h3>
<p>We may collect data from physical proximity beacons, RFID bracelets, or similar tracking technologies located in or near our venues or events, or (through partnerships with local businesses or entities) in other locations visited by users of our Digital Services. Proximity beacons emit radio signals and detect when a device enters a specific area. RFID bracelets (such as those worn by attendees at our festivals) each have a unique electromagnetic tag that can be read by a scanner. Through our use of RFID or beacon technologies, we may collect data about your location and other contextual data when you are near a beacon or when your RFID bracelet is scanned. Further, if your device preferences allow us or our Mobile App access to location services, we may collect information about the precise location of your device in or near our festivals, programs, and/or other events, including data from each of our or our partners’ beacons, wifi access points, or other location services with which you interact. This information may be collected when you are using one of our Mobile Apps and, periodically, in the background.</p>
<p>We typically use this information to send you relevant, targeted advertisements or offers (for example, a discount on food purchases near our event;) to analyze and improve our guests’ experience at our events; and to determine which events and services guests visit. We and any third parties enabling these features may store location data and combine it with other information we hold about you, including your customer profile. You may disable your mobile device’s communication with location services or proximity beacons by disabling the appropriate network interface (such as wifi or Bluetooth,) modifying your preferences for location services through your OS, or as otherwise described below.</p>
<p><em>Other sources of Personal Information or data</em></p>
<p>If we receive Personal Information or data from you through our Digital Services other than as described in this Privacy Policy, it will still be used and managed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise stated at the time you provide the information.</p>
<h3><span id="third-party-sites-and-services">Third party sites and services</span></h3>
<p>As described above, our Digital Services include features, functionality, or offers (such as ticket purchases, promotions, surveys, etc.) provided by third parties, and may also contain links to third party advertisers and others. When you make purchases through third parties, we do not receive or store your payment account information, as the purchase and payment transaction is processed by the third party. However we may sometimes receive your email, or the last 4 digits of your credit card (for confirmation purposes), or other information provided during a purchase from the company through which your transaction was processed.&nbsp; We may also receive information from other third parties collecting information on our Digital Services, such as a third party promotion in which you choose to register. &nbsp;Any third party websites or services to which our Digital Services link may use cookies, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information, and you should carefully review the privacy policies of these third parties before providing them any Personal Information. This Policy does not apply to any information you submit to third-party websites or services, including, without limitation, any sites to which our Digital Services may redirect you for purchasing tickets, or other sites that may be connected to our Digital Services by hypertext link or otherwise.</p>

We reserve the right to share your Personal Information with any of our current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies. We may also share your Personal Information and other information with trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may occasionally allow third parties to access certain Digital Services for marketing purposes.

<p>Please note, if you use any social media plugin, API, or other similar feature, use an event hashtag or similar link, or otherwise interact with us or our Digital Services via social media, anything you post may be made available on our Digital Services or to the general public. We may share, rebroadcast, or redisplay that information or other information derived from your social media interactions to the extent permitted by the terms of use governing the relevant social media service.</p>
<p>We may, without your consent, share Personal Information and other data with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the other circumstances noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services, payment processors, or other service providers. We also reserve the right to share any information we possess or data derived from it with service providers or others if such information has been reasonably de-identified.</p>
<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer data, including Personal Information, will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred, or may be disclosed (subject to confidentiality restrictions) during the due diligence process for a potential transaction.</p>
<p>In limited circumstances, we may, without your consent, access and disclose your Personal Information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you to the extent we believe such disclosure is required by law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.</p>
<h3><span id="what-choices-do-i-have-about-the-collection-use-and-disclosure-of-my-personal-or-other-information">What choices do I have about the collection, use, and disclosure of my personal or other information?</span></h3>

Please note, if you do not wish for us to provide certain information to one or more of our service providers, we may be unable to complete a transaction you request.</p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from all email newsletters or similar communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in every email. You can instruct us not to provide your personal information to these third parties by sending an email to privacypolicy@aeglive.com with “REMOVE THIRD PARTIES” in the subject line.&nbsp; If you receive a communication from a third party and you do not wish to receive future communications from that party, you should also tell them to remove you from their marketing list.
