<li>We restrict access to personal information to Company employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for the Company, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Application and Enforcement</b></p>
<p align="left">Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the educational products and services offered by the Company and its affiliates or other trusted business partners.&nbsp; Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or services from unrelated, third-party vendors. &nbsp;Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who are not related to the Company.</p>
<p align="left">The Company regularly reviews our internal compliance with our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;The Company also adheres to several internal safeguards related to the information we collect. &nbsp;When the Company receives formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. &nbsp;We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our students directly.</p>
