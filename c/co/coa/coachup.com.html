<h1 class="static_page_header">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective on August 16, 2012</p>

<p>This privacy statement describes how CoachUp collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Web website: www.coachup.com. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>

<p>Collection and Use of Personal Information</p>

<p>We collect the following personal information from you if you choose to become a Member and register with us:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Contact Information such as name, email address, billing address, phone number</li>
  <li> Billing Information such as credit card number, and billing address</li>
  <li> Unique Identifiers such as user name, account number, password</li>
  <li> Demographic information such as age, education, gender, interests and zip code</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, as is true of most Web sites, even if you do not register or become a Member we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. This information does not include personally identifiable information about you, however.</p>

<p>We use this information to</p>

<ul>
  <li> Fulfill your order</li>
  <li> Send you an order confirmation</li>
  <li> Assess the needs of your business to determine suitable products</li>
  <li> Send you requested product or service information</li>
  <li> Send product updates or warranty information</li>
  <li> Respond to customer service requests</li>
  <li> Administer your account</li>
  <li> Send you a newsletter</li>
  <li> Send you marketing communications</li>
  <li> Respond to your questions and concerns</li>
  <li> Improve our Web site and marketing efforts</li>
  <li> Conduct research and analysis</li>
  <li> Choice/Opt-Out</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose not to provide the information above, but if you do, CoachUp reserves the right to cancel your membership and/or to stop using your services as a CoachUp Coach.  Also, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at support@coachup.com</p>

<p>Information Sharing</p>

<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement and as may be further described at the time that you provide the requested information. </p>

<p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties, however, we will provide it to third parties who need the information to process your orders, conduct criminal background, sex offender or other checks on a Member’s credentials or personal history (“Background Checks”) or to provide services (such as for payment processing in connection with your Membership). Any such third parties will only use your personally identifiable information in connection with the fulfillment of Services or to perform Background Checks, or in connection with the disclosure of the results of such Background Checks as authorized by your acceptance of our Terms of Service, or to communicate with you about the Services. </p>

<p>Without limiting any other provision of this Policy or our Terms of Service, we may share (and you expressly authorize us to share): your personal information with third-party verification service providers for the purpose of performing Background Checks that you authorize when you sign up for our Services.  You also expressly authorize us to release the results of any Background Checks that we obtain relating to you with any other Member who has requested said data in connection with the Services.  In particular, we reserve the right to share, and you expressly authorize us to share the results of your Background Check with, if you are a Coach, any other Member who has engaged you for coaching services, and if you are a Coach Seeker over the age of 18 (or the parent or guardian of a Coach Seeker), with any Coach who has provided or agreed to provide you with coaching services. You may decide not to grant permission for Background Checks, or to rescind permission to do so, but if you do, CoachUp may immediately terminate your membership without further obligation of any kind.  </p>

<p>Because Background Checks are from third party providers, CoachUp disclaims all responsibility and liability for the results of said Background Checks.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, we may also disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We also reserve the right, if CoachUp is involved in, to disclose any information you have provided to a third party who acquires CoachUp via a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. In such case, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</p>

<p>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</p>

<p>We use another company to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our website.</p>

<p>Web beacons</p>

<p>Our web pages may also contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that are set by our third party partners. Web beacons are used along with cookies enabling our partners to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our website is used.</p>

<p>We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our website. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our website is used.</p>

<p>Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of CoachUp. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.</p>

<p>Security</p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<p>We may provide two means for you to make a purchase on our website. You can either use our order form or a third party payment option. If you use our shopping cart, the transmission of sensitive information collected on our order form is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you choose to use a third party payment option to pay for your order, its privacy statement and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement.</p>

<p>Additional Policy Information</p>

<p>Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>
