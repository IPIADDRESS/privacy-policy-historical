<li>We may record any telephone calls for quality assurance and training purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use publicly accessible information to verify information we are provided with and to manage and expand our organization.</p>
<p>Throughout the website there may be forms to request information and purchase or obtain products and/or services. These forms typically ask for contact information, financial information, and demographic information. Information from these forms is used to deliver the information, products and/or services that you request. It may also be used to notify you of future ICF products, services and/or opportunities that may be of interest to you. When completing these forms, please do not supply another person’s personal data to us unless we prompt you to do so and you have received that individual’s consent to do so.</p>
<h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
<p>We use information collected about you as outlined in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services you requested and those which we believe will optimize your use of the Site. We may use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide the information, services or support you request and related after-sales services;</li>
<li>To identify you, and to contact you from time to time with service updates;</li>
<li>To send other messages that are useful to the service we provide, including messages regarding our awards programs as well as messages from and regarding The International Coach Federation Foundation;</li>
<li>To manage our relationship with you and to carry out any related administration;</li>
<li>To provide personalised, targeted, or location-based content, services, and advertising from us and third parties;</li>
<li>To promote services, or the services of our suppliers, including by email and via social media platforms (subject to the relevant marketing permissions);</li>
<li>To compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties*;</li>
<li>To detect, investigate and prevent activity we think may be potentially illegal, unlawful or harmful and to enforce our Policy or any other purpose referenced herein or therein*;</li>
<li>To carry out research, including market research, statistical research on site traffic, sales and other commercial information to assist us in improving the services we provide to you and tailor the Site*;</li>
<li>To keep track of the areas of our Site you visit, the amount of time you spend and the date and time you access our Site to enable us to tailor it to better match your interests and/or preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>In more legal terms, we process your personal data where we have your consent to do so, which you may withdraw at any time, or otherwise where this is necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of our contract with you for the provision of our services or to take preliminary steps at your request;</li>
<li>Us to fulfil our legal obligations; or,</li>
<li>The purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests. Our legitimate interests are those indicated with a “*” above, and we consider that we have implemented sufficient checks and protections to ensure that your rights and interests are not unreasonably intruded on.</p>
<p><em>*However, you can object to processing on any of these bases at any time and, if you do so, we will stop processing the personal data unless we can show compelling legitimate grounds which override your rights and interests, or we need the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims – see “Your rights” below.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our Site uses “cookies” to help you access our Site. Also, our Site’s cookies help speed up navigation, keep track of items and help to provide you with custom-tailored content. In addition, we also use cookies to remember information that you gave us so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site. We use four types of cookies, which we describe in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Essential: </em>cookies that are essential to provide you with services you have requested. For example, these include the cookies that make it possible for you to stay logged into your ICF account. If you set your browser to block these cookies, then these functions and services will not work for you. In particular, we won’t be able to save your preferences about cookies.</li>
<li><em>Performance:</em> cookies which measure how often you visit our sites and how you use them. We use this information to get a better sense of how our users engage with our site, so that users have a better experience. For example, we collect information about which of our pages are most frequently visited, and by which types of users. We also use third-party cookies to help with performance. For example, the Google Analytics cookie gives us information such as your journey between pages and whether you have downloaded anything.</li>
<li><em>Functionality:</em> cookies that are used to recognize you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to our site, so that we can provide you with a more personalized experience.</li>
<li><em>Advertising:</em> cookies that are used to collect information about your visit to our site, the content you have viewed, the links you have followed and information about your browser, device and your IP address. We have set out more details on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>These various technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp;This information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p><strong>Cookie consent</strong></p>
<p>In most cases we will need your consent in order to use cookies on the Site. Exceptions to this apply such as where the cookie is essential in order for us to provide you with a service you have requested (e.g. to enable you to put items in your shopping basket and use our check-out process. If you visit our Site when your browser is set to accept cookies, we will interpret this as an indication that you consent to our use of cookies and other similar technologies as described in this policy. If you change your mind in the future about letting us use cookies, you can modify the settings of your browser to reject cookies or disable cookies completely. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings so that cookies are not accepted. If you do this, please be aware that you may lose some of the functionality of this Site. For further information about cookies and how to disable them please go for example to the UK Information Commissioner’s webpage on cookies: <u><a href="http://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/">https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/</a></u>.

					<div class="tab-content">
						<h2>Purpose for the ICF policy statement on the conduct or use of research</h2>
<p>Coaching is one of the world’s fastest-growing professions. As the major association that represents that profession, ICF has the responsibility to formulate an explicit policy concerning its perspective on the relationship of research and coaching practice. A policy statement provides guidance and direction to both practitioners and researchers; empowers participants, contributors, stakeholders, coaching organizations and clients alike with regard to engaging in or utilizing research; enhances the legitimacy of ICF as a whole; serves a protective function in that it guides behavior and, at the same time, sets boundaries; enhances decision-making; facilitates evaluation; and defines priorities.</p>
<p>This policy is intended to apply to ICF staff, the ICF Board and its executive, members of the International Coach Federation, and academic personnel or external vendors who wish to utilize ICF resources to engage in research on any aspect of coaching.</p>
<h2>Key Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Research</strong><br>
Not all information about coaching can be categorized as research. ICF’s working definition of research is: Research (including evaluation) is defined as any activity that involves the collection, collation, review or evaluation of data or information for the purpose of describing, maintaining or modifying activities, practices, interventions, or treatments. Research may involve the manipulation of variables or environmental factors whereas evaluation more typically involves the review of information for the purpose of providing feedback about the function, productivity or efficacy of an activity. Evaluation includes but is not limited to activities including needs assessments, process assessment, outcome studies, impact analysis, cost-benefit analysis and meta-analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Practice</strong><br>
ICF encourages and endorses evidence-based practice (EBP) with respect to effective coaching. That is, ICF wants coaches to make solid decisions regarding the method or technique they use based on their ability to critically assess the best available, current, valid and relevant coaching evidence before applying it to day-to-day coaching practices. ICF believes combining the explicit knowledge derived from sound research, broadly defined, as above, with the more tacit or experiential knowledge of the coach practitioner is the synergistic sine qua non of effective coaching.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Statement</strong><br>
It is ICF policy to encourage and promote research activities that enhance the professional development and standards of the worldwide coaching community. ICF strives to collaborate with organizations and individuals that promote the highest standards of research to establish a discipline of coaching studies to support and further the profession. ICF seeks to facilitate the exchange of information among researchers and practitioners studying coaching theory, methodologies, and outcomes. Equally important, ICF seeks to make this information available to practicing coaches and those interested in the coaching profession. Specifically, ICF’s goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the knowledge base concerning the art and science of coaching</li>
<li>Contribute to the advancement of coaching theory and the establishment of best evidence-based practices</li>
<li>Disseminate coaching research to the coach practitioner</li>
<li>Establish increased credibility for coaching as a discipline through the encouragement and support of best research practices and resulting theory development in coaching practice</li>
<li>Close the gap between coaching research and the practice of coaching by combining evidence-based practice with practice-based evidence</li>
</ul>
<p>By the same token, research on coaching might be divided into two broad categories: 1) market-oriented or industry-related research on the coaching profession; and 2) research to gather evidence on coaching techniques, coaching core competencies, coaching methodologies, coaching outcomes, and coaching theories.</p>
<h2>1) Market-Oriented or Industry-Related Research</h2>
<p>This kind of research on the coaching profession, on coaches and on coaching organizations often makes use of evaluative techniques and surveys conducted for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To track trends in the coaching profession so that ICF can best serve its membership</li>
<li>To assist the Board in making decisions regarding the future policies and directions of ICF</li>
<li>To provide information to member coaches on trends, coaching revenues, coaching practices, etc.</li>
<li>To provide valid information to media or other parties requesting information about the coaching profession</li>
<li>To facilitate ICF public relations (PR) efforts</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, market-oriented research is the coaching profession’s way of looking at itself. ICF’s policy is to prioritize requests for information from its members and to protect them from repeated and unnecessary demands on their time and resources. Thus, the criteria for ICF participation in such surveys is the importance of the information to be gathered and the legitimacy of the researcher or organization conducting the survey balanced against the time and/or other resources demanded of members or other respondents.</p>
<h2>2) Research to Gather Evidence on Coaching Techniques, Coaching Methodologies, Coaching Outcomes and Coaching Theories</h2>
<p>The core purpose of ICF is to advance the art, science, and practice of professional coaching. Coaching is an applied profession, and its successful development requires a dialectic process among coaches and practitioners to develop a discipline that can support the profession, and vice-versa. It is assumed that a discipline of coaching requires a solid theoretical foundation that will strengthen the coaching profession and contribute to its ongoing development. The quality of coaching theory will be determined by a vibrant research community combined with practitioners who both utilize and contribute to research inside and beyond ICF.</p>
<p>Therefore, for both broad categories of research on coaching (delineated in 1 and 2 above), ICF will encourage and collaborate with researchers and organizations that are gathering evidence on any aspect of coaching, given the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers must be aware of and adhere to the ICF Code of Ethics.</li>
<li>The research must meet ethical guidelines for the treatment of human subjects-for example, provisions of the American Psychological Association.</li>
<li>Members of ICF must be protected from undue demands on their time and resources, and any demands must be consistent with ICF priorities and policies.</li>
<li>Research must make every attempt to include an international scope of participants.</li>
<li>Internal or state-of-the-profession surveys may be commissioned from time-to-time by ICF.</li>
<li>External research directed toward and/or involving ICF Members and research links submitted for posting on the ICF</li>
<li>Research Portal shall be vetted by ICF.</li>
</ul>

					<div class="tab-content">
						<p>The ICF Member Directory and CCF are intended to be used as a tool for potential coaching clients and ICF Members to connect with other ICF Members. The Directory is not to be used to promote or market products and/or services to ICF Members.</p>
<p><strong>In order to protect our affiliates privacy, ICF will immediately refer these actions to our legal counsel; ICF expressly reserves all rights to take further action against those who violate our user agreement.<br>
</strong><br>
FTC indicates that the CAN-SPAM Act provides that “harvesting email addresses” is a violation of the Act that can give rise to criminal penalties, including imprisonment. Harvesting email addresses via unauthorized access to and use of email addresses secured from the ICF database and using those emails addresses to issue primarily commercial messages is a violation of the CAN-SPAM Act and subjects the sender to both significant civil fines ($16,000 per email) and criminal penalties.</p>
<p>The qualifications of coaches listed, and the information provided is not verified by ICF in any way. Individuals utilizing this database are urged to take reasonable steps to verify the qualifications of any potential coach. By utilizing the ICF Directories, you agree to hold ICF harmless from any and all claims which may arise as a result of your using the information provided and agree to adhere to the ICF Spam Policy and any other spam regulations that may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Member/coach contact information included on ICF’s website is not posted for the purpose of promoting/marketing products/services to coaches. It is primarily posted for the purpose of allowing potential clients of a coach to connect with a coach. All other email and electronic communications with members should adhere to the following principles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You should have a prior relationship with the person receiving your email. (Someone giving you their business card is acceptable in this regard, as it implies permission to get in contact. The same is true if someone has sent you an email.)</li>
<li>A valid “from” and “reply to” address must be included with each message.<br>
If you have a subscription list, you should send a confirmation email that the person wishes to be on the list.</li>
<li>There should always be a quick way to unsubscribe from any mail list.</li>
<li>Any request to cease mailing from an individual or organization should be quickly honored.</li>
<li>A complaint involving a breach of this policy may be considered a violation of the ICF Code of Ethics, and therefore referred to the Independent Review Board for their consideration. Should they find a breach occurred, remedies may be required. Sanctions may also be imposed such as suspending or terminating the coach’s membership and/or credential with the ICF.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that spam laws and regulations above and beyond ICF’s policies may apply to commercial electronic messages sent to individuals who have elected to list their contact information on the ICF website.</p>
