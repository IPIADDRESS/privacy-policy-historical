<p>POLICIES</p>
<p>Security Policy</p>
<p>We take the security of your information very seriously. Our e commerce system uses the latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology - the industry standard for encryption technology. It is used to create a secure transaction environment for commerce on the Internet. If your browser and local network support the use of encrypted data transmissions, our Secure Checkout mode locks all information (i.e.: your credit card number) passed from you to Clearly in an encrypted envelope, making it extremely difficult to be intercepted by an unauthorized party. SSL technology is compatible with Netscape, Internet Explorer, AOL, Web TV and most other browsers. It is the same level of encryption technology that NASA and the CIA use. This ensures that your credit card information remains totally secure. It's about as secure as using your local bank machine. </p>

<p>Service-related Announcements</p>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. </p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. </p>
<p>Newsletters</p>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section. </p>
<p>Opt-Out</p>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personal information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any special offer emails from us, you may opt-out at anytime by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email communication. </p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter. </p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@coastal.com">privacy@coastal.com</a>. </p>
