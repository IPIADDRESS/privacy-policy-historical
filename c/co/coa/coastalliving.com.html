        Time Warner Online Privacy Notice</font></b> </p>

<p>
Thank you for visiting Coastal Living Online, a Time Warner site.  Your privacy is 
important to us.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices 
and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Time Warner site.  
<a href="/about/time_titles.asp">Click here</a> 
for a list of the Time Warner businesses whose sites are governed by this Privacy Notice.
</p>

<p> <b>The Information We Collect</b></p>
<p> At some Time Warner sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote 
in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services 
such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums 
or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that 
may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, 
telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information 
about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 
</p>
<p>
At some other Time Warner sites, you can submit information about other people.  For example, you might submit 
a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it 
sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address.  The types of personally 
identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, 
e-mail address, and telephone number.  
</p>

<p>
At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable 
information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities 
and offerings.
</p>

<p> We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you 
visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using 
(e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you 
are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet 
service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). </p>      <p> <b>How We Use the Information</b> </p>
<p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your 
requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your 
inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs 
or services that we believe may be of interest to you. </p>

<p>
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our 
contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online 
newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
</p>

<p>
We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards.  From time to 
time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.  
The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive 
experience.  We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from 
time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.  
</p>

<p>
If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish your screen name 
and other information you have provided to us. 
</p>

<p>
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of 
our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  We also may use this information in the 
aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.  
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a 
court order or a subpoena.  We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's 
request.
</p>

<p>
Agents and contractors of Time Warner who have access to personally identifiable information are required to 
protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the 
information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Time Warner.
Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot 
assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is 
inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.  
</p>

<p>
Certain Time Warner sites may disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose practices are not 
covered by this privacy notice (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers and non-profit organizations) 
that want to market products or services to you.  If a site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide 
you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses.  For instructions on how to opt out from such disclosures, 
please send an e-mail along with your first and last name to 
<a href="mailto:coastalliving@spc.com">coastalliving@spc.com</a>
</p>

<p>
Time Warner may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability 
to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you.  If you prefer not to receive marketing 
information from this site, please send an e-mail along with your first and last name to 
<a href="mailto:coastalliving@spc.com">coastalliving@spc.com</a> 
for instructions on how to make your request.
Finally, Time Warner sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways 
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated 
uses.
</p>

      <p> <b>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</b></p>
      <p> Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices 
        may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy 
        notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or 
        collected by, these third parties. </p>

      <p> Time Warner sites sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, 
        or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third 
        parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain 
        personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to 
        participate in the site activity. Time Warner has no control over the 
        third-party's use of this information. The Time Warner site will notify 
        you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these 
        third parties will obtain such information. Some Time Warner sites may 
        use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that 
        you may see at its Web pages. Our privacy policy does not cover any use 
        of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. 
        For more information on this site's use of such third-party ad servers, 
        please click here <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;">

      </p>

      <p> <b>Cookies</b></p>
      <p> To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use 
        "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser 
        to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your 
        e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you 
        choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering 
        at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with 
        personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to 
        the data stored in the cookie. </p>

<p>
We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites.  For example, we 
may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return 
to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites.  
We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.
