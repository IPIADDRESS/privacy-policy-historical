	<h2>Cool Text Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>
		<font size="-1">Cool Text, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to
			protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued
			support for the responsible management of consumer information.

			<br>
			<br>

	</p>
	<p>
		<font size="-1">During the process of delivering an ad to you, Cool Text does not collect
			any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number,
			or e-mail address. However, Cool Text does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable
			information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet,
			your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or
			Windows, for example). The information collected by Cool Text is used for the purpose
			of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.
			<br>
			<br>
		</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font size="-1">In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response
			to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code).
			If this does occur, Cool Text may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser.
			This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition,
			Cool Text may combine this information with other users' information and review
			it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific
			type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.

	<p>
		<font size="-1">Cool Text, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance
			your experience on the web. Cool Text cannot use these cookies to personally identify
			you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number
			that is provided to you the first time Cool Text serves you an ad. This unique number,
			which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Cool Text target ads to
			you. This cookie can help Cool Text ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple
			times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their
			offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested
			in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet
			experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more
			relevant content to you, they are not required for Cool Text to deliver you an ad.
