<p>Additionally, our web server automatically collects click-stream information such as the address (or "URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.</p>

<p>Whenever you request a page from The Websites your IP address, browser and version, operating system, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file.

<p>NAMG allows access to database information by third parties providing technical services, such as e-mail, but only to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. In those instances, the third party is bound by these terms. Your informed consent shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. You understand and agree that we may disclose to third parties your zip code, gender and/or age, but only in the form of aggregated information. In addition, you agree that we may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of NAMG or its affiliated entities.</p>

<p>If you choose not to activate your membership, your name and email address may be shared with third parties.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to offer you third party services and products based on the preferences that you identify during the registration process or from information gathered from surveys and based on your subsequent preferences; such offers may be provided to you by NAMG.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to terminate your account if we learn that you have provided NAMG with false or misleading registration information.</p>

<p> <b>THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</b><br>
We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information, is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services.<br>
<br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. </p>
<p> <b>COOKIES</b><br>
"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of the site and allow tracking of usage behavior. Cookies are used to compile aggregate data that allows content improvements and targeted advertising. We share aggregated data (information that does not identify you) with third parties. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you do not want non-personal information about your visits collected through the use of cookies, you may set your computer to deny or accept the cookie feature through a simple process in most browsers; however, without cookies we may be unable to provide you with certain features (e.g., customized or personalized delivery of information) otherwise available on The Websites. </p>
<p> <b>CHILDREN</b><br>
  We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Websites are not 
  directed at children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not 
  provide any personal information on The Websites. We will not knowingly or intentionally 
  collect personal information online from children under the age of 18.</p>
<p><b>SECURITY</b><br>
  NAMG maintains practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity 
  and confidentiality of personal information collection through the Sites. A 
  firewall protects the e-mail server to which all personal information is delivered. 
  Access to the information is limited to those employees and contractors who 
  need it to carry out their business functions. NAMG's employees are educated 
  about the importance of safeguarding personal information and preventing unauthorized 
  access, disclosure and use. Finally, we use secure server software ("SSL") that 
  encrypts credit card information (including your name and address) submitted 
  to any of The Websites. This encryption protects this information so it cannot 
  be viewed as it is transmitted over the Internet. <b> </b></p><b>
</b><p><b> LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</b><br>
  This Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites that may be accessible 
  through The Websites. The Websites may contain links to third-party websites. 
  The linked sites are not under the control of NAMG, and we are not responsible 
  for the privacy practices or the contents of any linked site, or any link contained 
  in a linked site. We are providing these links only as a convenience, and the 
  inclusion of a link on our websites does not imply endorsement of the linked 
  site by NAMG. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites 
  to learn how they collect and use information about you.</p>

<p><b>OPT-OUT</b><br>
  You may inform us if you wish to remove your personal information from our database, 
  and we will to comply with your request as soon as reasonably possible. Please
