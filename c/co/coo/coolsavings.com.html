        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Our Commitment to Data Security</div>

        <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
        
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. When you enter sensitive information (such as regulated and controlled data), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
    
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Access to Personally Identifiable Information</div>
        
        <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may submit those changes through the My Preferences section of the website.  If you request deletion of your information previously collected, please note that your personal information will be suppressed from further use as described in this policy.  However, we will retain and use your personal information as necessary in order to comply with our corporate policies, including but not limited to legal obligations, dispute resolution and enforcement of our agreements. To submit such as request concerning the personal information we previously collected contact us <a href="http://reg.coolsavings.com/info.htm?tp=con&amp;promo_name=&amp;catalog_id=14078"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>
        
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</div>
	
        <p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For this reason, we never knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that such information has been collected, that information will be immediately suppressed from our database.</p>
    
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Use of Cookies</div>
    
        <p>Our website use cookies to enhance and personalize your online experience and to enable our website to recognize you as a previous visitor. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can adjust the settings on your browser to erase or block such technologies from your computer if you want to, but if you do so, you may experience difficulty using or accessing CoolSavings.</p>
        
        <p>Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences and may be tied to your personally identifiable information such as your email address for these purposes. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
        
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Web Beacons</div>
    
        <p>We and third parties employ a software technology called Web Beacons that help us better manage content on our website by informing us what content is effective.  Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information such as their email address, to enhance and personalize content and your online experience.</p>
        
        <p>We use Web Beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice/Opt-out." </p>
        
        <p>Our website also allows its partners and advertisers that are presenting advertisements on the CoolSavings website to set their cookies, or apply Web Beacons or similar technologies, to your computer. We have no access or control of these third party tracking technologies. This information may be used to: </p>
