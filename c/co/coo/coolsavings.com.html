        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Our Commitment to Data Security</div>
          
        <p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect our end-users’ personal information.  When end-users make personal information available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any personal information offline).  Where our registration/application process prompts end-users to enter sensitive information, if any (such as credit card information, bank account information, Social Security Number, etc.), and when we store and transmit such sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software that complies with the encryption requirements established by the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), such as advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).</p>
          
        <p>Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is not accessible to the public.  All of our end-users’ personal information is restricted in our offices, as well as the offices of our third party service providers.  Only employees or third party agents who need personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information.  Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all end-user personal information.  Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.  The servers that we store personal information on are kept in a secure physical environment.  We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and/or alteration of personal information under our control.</p>
          
        <p>Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocol or data transmission over the Internet or via wireless networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software may constitute a crime punishable by law.  For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your personal information will be absolutely secure.  Any transmission of data at or through the Site, other CoolSavings® Offerings, or otherwise via the Internet or wireless network, is done at your own risk.</p>
          
        <p>In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Access to Personally Identifiable Information</div>
          
        <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may submit changes through the My Preferences section of the website.  If you request deletion of your personal information, please note that your personal information will be suppressed from further use as described in this Privacy Policy.  However, we will retain and use your personal information as necessary in order to comply with our corporate policies including, but not limited to, legal obligations, dispute resolution and enforcement of our agreements. To submit such a request concerning the personal information we previously collected, contact us <a href="http://reg.coolsavings.com/info.htm?tp=con&amp;promo_name=&amp;catalog_id=14078" target="_blank">here</a>. We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days.</p>
          
        <p>We ask individual end-users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
          
        <p>Please be advised that deleting your personal information may terminate your access to certain of the CoolSavings® Offerings, including potentially terminating your eligibility in any Sweepstakes that you have entered and potentially terminating any request for Sample(s) and/or Coupons that you have submitted.  If you wish to continue using the full complement of CoolSavings® Offerings, you may not be able to delete all of the personal information that we have on file for you.</p>
          
        <p>Please be further advised that, after you delete your personal information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Our  Commitment to Children's Privacy</div>
          
        <p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For this reason, we never knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that such information has been collected, that information will be immediately suppressed from our database.</p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Use  of Cookies</div>
          
        <p>The Site uses cookies to enhance and personalize your online experience and to enable the Site to recognize you as a previous visitor. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can adjust the settings on your browser to erase or block such technologies from your computer if you want to, but if you do so, you may experience difficulty using or accessing certain of the CoolSavings® Offerings.</p>
          
        <p>Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies that it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many websites do this whenever an end-user visits the website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences and may be tied to your personally identifiable information, such as your email address for these purposes. End-users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.  To find out more about Cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.  </p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Web Beacons</div>
          
        <p>We, as well as third parties, employ web beacons, pixel technology and other tracking software and/or technology (collectively, <strong>"Web Beacons"</strong>) that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us of what content is effective.  Certain Web Beacons are comprised of tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on an end-user’s computer hard drive, Web Beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our end-users’ personally identifiable information, such as their email addresses, to enhance and personalize content and the end-user’s online experience.</p>
          
        <p>We use Web Beacons in our HTML-based e-mail to let us know which e-mail messages have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of the receipt of these e-mail communications, please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section above.</p>
          
        <p>The Site also allows our partners and advertisers that are presenting advertisements on the Site to set their cookies, or apply Web Beacons or similar technologies, to your computer. We have no access to, or control over, these third party tracking technologies. This information may be used to:</p>

            <li>enable you to participate in certain online activities, such as making sure that each person only votes in an online poll once;</li>
            <li>5.  help measure and research the effectiveness of the Site, including collecting statistics on your response to advertisements, e-mail and other communications that you receive; and/or</li>
            <li>remember the preferences and registration data that you provide to us.</li>
        </ol>
          
        <p>The Site and our associated third parties may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Site. These ad network providers may use cookies, Web Beacons or similar technologies on your computer to tailor content, advertisements to your preferences, help target, measure and track your visits and the effectiveness of advertisements and promotions, using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audiences and to provide security within shopping baskets or transactions. The use of cookies, Web Beacons and similar technologies is subject to their respective privacy policies, not this one. If you do not wish to have this information used by certain ad network providers for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. You may find more information located on the website of the individual third-party ad network, the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>), and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). </p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Log  Files</div>
          
        <p>We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
          
        <p>We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site and CoolSavings® Offerings, to track end-users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user-base as a whole.</p>
          
        <p>We may link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information to document your registration IP address, date and time, detect and investigate malicious activity, as necessary, comply with our corporate policies including, but not limited to, legal obligations, dispute resolution and enforcement of our agreements and to assist us with enhancing and personalizing content and your online experience.</p>
          
        <p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Site, in the aggregate, in order to track usage and volume statistics for purposes of improving the CoolSavings® Offerings.</p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Links  to Other Sites</div>

        <p>Our offer pages and other pages on the Site may be powered by third parties that are either acting as a service provider for us or in some other cases may own and control the data collected (for example, our Community pages).  Please view the Privacy Policy that links from each page on the Site to understand these relationships.</p>
          
        <div class="memberBoxHeader">Changes in this Privacy Statement</div>
          
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information collection, use and sharing practices. If the manner in which we use personally identifiable information changes, we will notify you by: (a) sending the modified policy to our end-users via email; and/or (b) by any other reasonable means acceptable under applicable state and federal law.  You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner, and we will only use your information in this different manner where you opt-in to such use.
