<p>The following Privacy Statement discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for coolnsmart.com</p>
<p>Our site, like most other sites, uses cookies to provide you with a more personalized experience. A cookie is a message that is sent to a web browser from a Web server and stored on your computer. Cookies help in keeping track of the size of our visitors, the frequency of visits to our website and the sections that are most popular. Most browsers allow you to disable all cookies, but in that case you might not be able to use certain features of our website.</p>
<p>We may also log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration. In some cases your IP address stays the same from one browser session to another; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider such as AOL or Earthlink, chances are that your IP address is not static, it varies with each session, thus making it effectively impossible for us to use your IP address to determine who you are.</p>
<p>In general, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of another user.</p>
<p>By using this website, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If you are not comfortable with any policy described in this Privacy Statement, you may e- mail us with questions or concerns, but your only remedy is to discontinue use of the website. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time.</p>
<p>Our site may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you use these links to leave our site, we do not anymore have control over that website. Such sites are not governed by this privacy statement and we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you provide to those sites. Exercise caution and read the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>
<p>We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our website. These ads may contain cookies and are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong><br>
In order to server advertisements on this site, our third- party advertiser may add a unique “cookie” on your browser. These companies may use some information (such as your domain type, your IP address, about your visits to this and other websites) in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about products and services that may be of your interest.</p>
<p>Google, one of our third-party advertisers, may add a cookie to determine targeted advertisements based on your preferences and your visit to our site and other sites on the internet. To find out more about Google and its DoubleClick DART cookie used to generate interest-based advertising, or to opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.
