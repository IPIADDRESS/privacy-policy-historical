<h3>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
<p>Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.</p>
<p>Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies.</p>
<p>A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date).</p>
<p>A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the cookies our website places on your computer.</p>
<p>If you object to the use of the following types of cookie it is our opinion that the very best way to handle this is to put a stop to them across all of the sites that you browse. Below the list of cookies you will find instructions on removing or blocking cookies. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;">If you are not happy about us dropping cookies on your computer and cannot or do not want to remove or block cookies at a browser level you must not use our website.</span></p>

<h3>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies and personal information</h3>
<p>Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but personal information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
<h3>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocking cookies</h3>
<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. For example:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Internet Explorer (version 9) you can block cookies using the cookie handling override settings available by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy” and then “Advanced”;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Firefox (version 16) you can block all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Options”, “Privacy”, selecting “Use custom settings for history” from the drop-down menu, and unticking “Accept cookies from sites”; and</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Chrome (version 23), you can block all cookies by accessing the “Customise and control” menu, and clicking “Settings”, “Show advanced settings” and “Content settings”, and then selecting “Block sites from setting any data” under the “Cookies” heading.</p>
<p>Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.</p>
<p>If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the features on this website.</p>
<h3>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting cookies</h3>
<p>You can also delete cookies already stored on your computer. For example:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Internet Explorer (version 9), you must manually delete cookie files (you can find instructions for doing so at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835);</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Firefox (version 16), you can delete cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Options”, “Privacy” and then “Show Cookies”, and then clicking “Remove All Cookies”; and</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Chrome (version 23), you can delete all cookies by accessing the “Customise and control” menu, and clicking “Settings”, “Show advanced settings” and “Clear browsing data”, and then selecting “Delete cookies and other site and plug-in data” before clicking “Clear browsing data”.</p>
<p>Again, doing this may have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.</p>
