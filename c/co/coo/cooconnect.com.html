        Privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        Protecting privacy is a top priority at COOConnect.com implements robust privacy
        protections, high-level security, and fair information practices to protect members'
        personal information. This statement describes the policies that govern the collection,
        maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information about our members. This
        is a short description of the COOConnect.com privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Openness
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com fully discloses our privacy policy and information practices. We
        describe in detail what member information we collect, how we use it, and how we
        disclose it. As COOConnect.com evolves and offers new services, this policy will
        be updated to reflect the changes. However, our strong commitment to privacy, security,
        and fair information practices will never change.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Accuracy, access
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com aims to provide accurate and up-to-date information as part of our
        service. We permit and encourage members to review their information and to make
        any necessary corrections.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Security
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com maintains all personal data with appropriate and high-level physical,
        electronic, and managerial safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality
        of the data against foreseeable risks. Security is designed to prevent unauthorized
        use, access, disclosure, destruction, and change of data.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Disclosure
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com fully describes all sources, uses, and disclosures of member data.
        We do not collect, use, or disclose any information about our members without their
        knowledge and approval. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise disclose our member
        lists or member information to third parties. We do not share snail mail or email
        lists with anyone.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Accountability
    </h3>
    <p>
        All COOConnect.com employees, affiliates and alliance partners must sign an agreement
        guaranteeing their strict adherence to this privacy policy. We select partners who
        not only meet our standards for privacy and security, but also embrace them. We
        will work with members to obtain a fair and rapid resolution of any complaints or
        disputes about privacy.

        Information collection from members
    </h3>
    <p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Registration</h4>
                <p>
                    The basic way that COOConnect.com obtains information about a member is through
                    the registration process. When you register, you are asked to provide certain personal
                    information. You also select a COOConnect.com user ID and password. You can opt-out
                    of receiving email from COOConnect.com that you do not want.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Surveys</h4>
                <p>
                    COOConnect.com may occasionally ask members and visitors to complete surveys and
                    opinion polls about their interests, needs, and attitudes. Surveys help us provide
                    better services that meet member needs. Participation is completely voluntary. We
                    do not use any survey information in individually identifiable form. Once you complete
                    a survey, any links between your identity and your answers are broken as quickly
                    as possible. All information provided through surveys is only used in an aggregate
                    way. Individual survey responses are never used or disclosed in any other way.
                </p>

    <p></p>
    <h3>
        Information collection from visitors
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you are just visiting the COOConnect.com website, we do not normally collect
        any information about you except through web logs (see below). However, if you fill
        out a web form, send us an email, or choose to share information with us in any
        other way, we will have the information that you provided and will use it to respond
        to your inquiry or to fulfill your request if we can. We do not routinely share
        any of this information with anyone else unless appropriate to respond to your request.
        If you receive email from COOConnect.com that you no longer want to receive, you
        can ask us to stop by sending a request to<a href="#info@cooconnect.com">info@cooconnect.com</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Weblogs
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com maintains standard web logs that automatically record basic information
        about everyone who visits our website. These logs contain:
        </p><ul>
            <li>The Internet domain from which you access COOConnect.com (e.g., aol.com, xyz.edu).</li>
            <li>Your IP address. Your computer is automatically assigned an IP address when you
                surf the Internet. Static IP addresses are potentially identifiable, but dynamic
                addresses are usually not identifiable. </li>
            <li>The type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer or Netscape) and operating system (e.g.,
                Windows XP, Mac OS X) you use. </li>
            <li>The date and time you visited RFPConnect.com. </li>
            <li>The pages that you visited here. </li>
            <li>The address of the website you linked here from. </li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        COOConnect.com uses web log information to help us design our website, to identify
        popular features, and for other managerial purposes. We do not normally make any
        attempt to identify individuals from web logs. However, web logs may be used if
        necessary to help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website.
        We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that
        we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.
    <p></p>
    <h3>
        Partner privacy standards
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com contracts with other companies to assist in supporting our core features
        and functions. When necessary for these services to function, we exchange member
        information with these companies or those members who have selected those services.
        We require that our key partners treat our members' data under the same high privacy
        and security standards that COOConnect.com uses. This means that personal information
        provided to our partners is not sold, rented, or shared by them except as necessary
        to accomplish the purpose of the disclosure. It also means that our partners will
        not use personal data for marketing to our members.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Advertisers and others
    </h3>
    <p>
        Through advertisers, outside content providers, and marketing affiliates, COOConnect.com
        offers members the opportunity to contact other companies to obtain information
        or to buy products or services. COOConnect.com never shares any of your individual
        information with these companies. It is up to you to decide when and whether to
        give your personal information to these companies. If you provide information, its
        use is governed by the policies and practices of these companies and not by COOConnect.com's
        policies and practices. COOConnect.com makes no representations or warranties about,
        and has no liability or responsibility toward its members in connection with, any
        of these other companies or their privacy policies. Once you click through to an
        unaffiliated website, COOConnect.com privacy policies no longer apply. We strongly
        urge our members to read the privacy policies of these other companies and their
        websites. We collect personal and plan information to facilitate a leading edge
        service development process, to provide you with a customized workplace experience,
        and to provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the appropriate
        audience. We do not, however, provide your personal information directly to advertisers.
        All COOConnect.com employees, affiliates and alliance partners must sign an agreement
        guaranteeing their strict adherence to this privacy policy. We select partners who
        not only meet our standards for privacy and security, but also embrace them. We
        will work with members to obtain a fair and rapid resolution of any complaints or
        disputes about privacy.

        Cookies
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com only uses so-called session cookies. These stay in your computer's
        memory as long as you are logged on to our site. They are used to facilitate your
        personal navigation through the site. These cookies are deleted entirely from your
        computer when you log off of our Web site or when you close your Web browser. Your
        browser probably allows you to control the use of cookies on your computer. Browsers
        usually accept cookies unless you choose otherwise. You can tell your browser to
        alert you when cookies are used or to disable or refuse cookies. If you decide not
        to permit cookies on your computer, our Web site will not function. If you click
        through to other websites, you will find that many of these sites set their own
        cookies. COOConnect.com does not see or use these cookies, and we do not control
        how other sites use cookies.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Privacy policy changes and updates
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com will update this policy from time to time as we add new services
        and new features. However, our strong commitment to privacy, security, and fair
        information practices will never change. Changes on our website will require additional
        descriptions about the flow of data. We will tell our users about changes in this
        policy by making changes on this page, which will always contain a version number
        and date, making it easy to see when changes have taken place. You can also let
        us know here whether you want to be notified of any changes to this policy through
        <a href="mailto:info@cooconnect.com">info@cooconnect.com</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Accuracy, access
    </h3>
    <p>
        We will tell our users about changes in this policy by making changes on this page,
        which will always contain a version number and date, making it easy to see when
        changes have taken place. A member can terminate his or her service with COOConnect.com
        at any time. When service is terminated, COOConnect.com will make every effort to
        remove all information from our system and to stop sending email and newsletters.
        Like other Internet and computer service organizations, COOConnect.com maintains
        several types of backups to its records. The backups permit us to restore service
        in the event of a natural disaster, equipment failure, or other problem. Backups
        provide important protections for everyone because they lessen the risk of loss
        of valuable data. Removing a member from our main files does not remove that member's
        record from any of the backup systems. It may take months before backup records
        are completely recycled and all traces of a member's registration and related data
        are completely removed. Of course, backup records remain subject to the same protections
        as other COOConnect.com records.

        with defined program goals, objectives, and priorities. Senior management is committed
        to providing adequate resources for security, to making sure that those resources
        are applied to security, and to doing whatever is necessary to make sure that security
        is a successful part of the COOConnect.com operation. COOConnect.com recognizes
        that security is an essential part of its computer system. We also recognize that
        no one can guarantee complete and perfect security against every possible hazard.
        We make every reasonable effort to provide high-level security. This includes a
        continual review of security measures and plans, the use of new technology when
        available and appropriate, and regular training for our personnel. If you click
        through to another website offering products, services, or content, any information
        that you disclose to that website will be subject to the security policies of that
        website and not those of COOConnect.com. Before you provide personal information
        to other companies, we encourage you to read their security policies.

        Disclosure
    </h3>
    <p>
        COOConnect.com fully describes all sources, uses, and disclosures of COOConnect.com
        member data. We do not collect, use, or disclose any information about our members
        without their knowledge and approval. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise
        disclose our member lists or member information to third parties. We do not share
        snail mail or email lists with anyone. COOConnect.com recognizes that the information
        you provide is personal and valuable. COOConnect.com believes the service we provide
        to our members should make their lives easier, without the fear that their personal
        information will end up in the wrong hands. This privacy policy describes the basic
        data disclosures that we make with our partners in order to support our core functions
        and features. COOConnect.com uses the information collected about you to assist
        you. We use personally identifiable information about our members only in defined
        and responsible ways. We use your information internally to respond to your requests,
        provide support, maintain your account, and for similar purposes. We do not share
        user information with third parties except when we have informed users about the
        disclosures, when we have prior consent, or when required by law. We do not share
        your personal information in individually identifiable form with advertisers. Where
        COOConnect.com indicates that a part of our site is presented in cooperation with
        a third party or sponsored by a third party, the privacy policy of COOConnect.com
        remains valid. That third party does not have access to your individual personal
        or plan information unless you expressly give permission to share this information.
        The providers featuring their information on sponsored pages do not know who visited
        these pages unless the visitor volunteered that information. Some personal information
        maintained by COOConnect.com may be used on occasion by outside auditors, consultants,
        and others hired by COOConnect.com to assist in carrying out financial or operational
        activities. We permit these uses or disclosures only when necessary. All recipients
        must agree in writing to safeguard personal information, to use it only for an authorized
        purpose, and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity. In addition,
        it is possible that COOConnect.com could be required to disclose personal information
        in response to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court
        order. All record keepers face the possibility that disclosure of their records
        may be compelled in some civil, criminal, or administrative matters. Disclosures
        may also be appropriate to protect COOConnect.com's legal rights or during emergencies
        if physical safety is believed to be at risk. We think that these events are unlikely,
        but they are possible. We will take reasonable steps to limit the scope and consequences
        of any of these disclosures. If we receive a subpoena demanding disclosure of your
        records, we will make all reasonable efforts to notify you of the subpoena when
        possible.
