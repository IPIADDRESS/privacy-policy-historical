<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>



<p>Coolpad.US is run and managed by Coolpad Technologies Inc. under China Wireless Group, which consists of Yulong Computer Telecommunication Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD., Coolpad Communications Private Limited, and Coolpad Technologies Inc.</p>



<p><strong>Customer’s Privacy</strong></p>



<p>1. GENERAL ASPECTS OF DATA COLLECTION AND USE</p>



<p>The privacy policy stipulated below (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to all online services directly provided by Coolpad Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Coolpad”) These services are referred to collectively herein as the “Coolpad Services”. Coolpad is committed to protecting the online privacy of web visitors, users and customers of all of Coolpad Services.</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to advise you about the types of information we collect about you when you visit or submit information directly to Coolpad.</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you provide directly to third parties, including services or content you access via a Coolpad webpage.</p>



<p>You should always check the applicable privacy policy of any third party service providers whose service or content you access.</p>



<p>To the extent permitted by all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Laws, rules and regulations of the People’s Republic of China (“Chinese Law”), and the Laws, rules and regulations of the United States of America, including its political subdivisions (collectively, “American Law”), Coolpad does not represent or warrant that Coolpad Services, or any part thereof, is appropriate, complete, accurate, or available for use in any specific jurisdiction.</p>



<p>If you choose to access Coolpad Services, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you alone are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, Chinese Law and American Law.</p>



<p>As part of the Coolpad Services, you are given the chance to consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Failure to consent to such terms constitutes sufficient grounds for us to refuse access to the Coolpad Services in whole or in part, all is determined by us in our sole and complete discretion.</p>



<p>Your use and/or acceptance of all or any portion of the Coolpad Services shall be construed as your acceptance of all terms of this Privacy Policy in full, including, without limitation, the collection, disclosure, transfer, use, management and storage of “Personal Information”, as defined and described below. You understand and agree that Coolpad offers this service to the public in general and it is not reasonably feasible for Coolpad to enter into more specific agreements with consumers of the Coolpad Services, and that for the benefit of all, as well our protection from and against unwarranted liability, generally applicable rules must be applied and enforced.</p>



<p>From time to time Coolpad may transfer or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to its online databases or store off-line information in an electronic format.</p>



<p>This Privacy Policy covers all “Personal Information” and will remain in full force and effect as long the visitor uses all or any portion of the Coolpad Services, even if such visitor’s use of, or participation in, any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.</p>



<p>Coolpad’s website, online services, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help Coolpad better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of the Coolpad Services have been accessed, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Coolpad treats information collected by cookies and other technologies as non Personal Information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information under applicable law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information. Similarly, to the extent that non-Personal Information is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>We use cookies and other technologies to remember Personal Information when you access Coolpad Services. If you want to disable cookies, check the features of your computer browser as well as the services offered by your Internet services provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note some of the Coolpad Services may not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>



<p>As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We reserve the right to use this general information in designing our advertising and marketing services, but we are not obligated to do so. Notwithstanding, we will not use any Personal Information in connection with the design and developing of our advertising marketing services in any manner that discloses to the general public all or any portion of your Personal Information.</p>



<p>In some of our email messages, we may employ a “click-through URL” linked to some portion of the Coolpad Services. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>



<p>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<br></p>



<p>2. INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT</p>



<p>Personal Information: In connection with your interaction with the Coolpad Services and submission of information to our website, including creation of a user name, completion of registration forms, responding to surveys and polls, registration of products, purchase of products, download of updates, and/or other use of the Coolpad Services, we may request that visitors supply us with Personal Information. Personal Information is specific and private information pertaining specifically to a particular individual and not designed for release to the general public, such as a name, mailing address, phone number, email address, home or work telephone number, contact preferences, and credit card information. The foregoing types of information are referred to herein as “Personal Information”.</p>



<p>We will make reasonable efforts to notify you when we are gathering Personal Information, and, other than incidentally in connection with the other activities described in this Privacy Policy, we will attempt to collect Personal Information only when you voluntarily submit it to us through our online forms and questionnaires, SMS text campaigns or through other voluntary on or offline means.</p>



<p>Although you obviously have no obligation to provide us with any information to use the Coolpad Services, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the features, files and locations that comprise the Coolpad Services if you choose not to provide certain information to us, all of which we, in our sole and complete discretion, determine. If, however, you do choose to give us Personal Information as part of your interaction with Coolpad Services, we will collect and retain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>



<p>Coolpad takes reasonable measures to ensure that the Personal Information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on visitors to update or correct Customer’s Personal Information whenever necessary. All users of Coolpad Service are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be incorrect, false, falsified, or fraudulent, or inconsistent with or in violation of the Privacy Policy, to the extent we are reasonably able to make such an evaluation in any particular instance. Neither the foregoing nor anything else herein shall require that we take any specific steps to verify or otherwise confirm that any information submitted to us by third parties is complete and/or accurate.</p>



<p>Non-Personal Information: When visitors use all or any portion of the Coolpad Services, we may also collect “non-Personal Information”. We consider “non-Personal Information” to be information that cannot be used to identify with specificity or contact visitors personally, such as demographic information, including, without limitation, education level, profession, zip code, interests, and the like. Non-Personal Information may also include technical information, such as Customer’s IP address and other anonymous data involving use of Coolpad Services. In addition, non-Personal Information may also include information that visitors provide us in the course of using the Coolpad Services, such as the terms visitors enter into the search functions of Coolpad Services and comments voluntarily left by them.</p>



<p>We reserve the right to use or disclose non-Personal Information pursuant to this Privacy Policy. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose certain information when, in our sole and complete discretion, we determine that such disclosure is necessary to protect us or our employees and other agents, the rights or property of any of the foregoing, or to protect the physical safety or health of our employees and/or any member or members of the general public.</p>



<p>Any submissions that visitors make to any public areas of the Site such as bulletin boards (“Public Areas”) will be public and will not be considered Personal Information under any circumstances. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the actions of other users of the Coolpad Services or of third parties with respect to any information visitors post in Public Areas. In addition, information that visitors submit to Public Areas may be collected and used by others to send visitors unsolicited messages and for other purposes. We have no obligation to prevent them from doing so.<br></p>
