	<p>Coors Brewing Company respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Web sites or responds to online advertisements or e-mail campaigns. This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information that Coors Brewing Company may collect from the Web sites, online advertisements at other Web sites and e-mail campaigns, and how we may use the information. This Policy will also provide you with instructions on what to do if you don't want to share personal information with us. Coors Brewing Company may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check it occasionally. </p>
	<p>Access to Coors Brewing Company Web sites is restricted to people of legal drinking age, including access to all advertising and marketing information on the sites.</p>
	<p>The Coors Brewing Company Web sites are intended only for persons of legal drinking age. Date of birth verification is required at the entrance of the Web site and age verification prompts may also be located within the Web sites. If someone under the legal drinking age has provided us with personal information by obtaining access in violation of the Web site access restrictions, Coors Brewing Company asks that the parent or guardian of that person contact us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Policy and request removal of the information from our records. Upon receiving your request, we will promptly remove such information from our records.</p>
	<h3>Any Information You Provide is Voluntary</h3>
	<p>The Coors Brewing Company Web sites may request from you information such as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth and/or your e-mail address.  Please know that any information you provide to us is voluntary on your part and not required by Coors Brewing Company.</p>
	<p>If you do not want information collected from the Coors Brewing Company Web sites, please do not submit any information to us or agree to the collection of your information. If you have already submitted personal information to us and would like us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Policy and request removal of the information from our records. Once we receive your request, we will remove the personal information you provided to Coors Brewing Company from our files.</p>
	<p>If you do provide Coors Brewing Company with information, unless we advise you otherwise, we may use the information such as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth and/or your e-mail address to provide requested information or products, to improve our products and/or services, to send information or publications, to revise our Web site to better address your interests, to use as an entry to a contest or sweepstakes, to provide to third-parties affiliated with Coors Brewing Company, and/or to contact you. We may share your information with persons and entities that are affiliated with Coors Brewing Company. We do not provide the information to third parties not affiliated with Coors Brewing Company unless we have your consent to do so. In addition, upon your consent, we may provide your information, as listed above, to third parties and entities that are not affiliated with Coors Brewing Company.</p>
	<p>From time to time, certain pages on our Web site permit visitors to send e-mails containing content/copy prepared by or on behalf of Coors Brewing Company to friends, acquaintances or other third parties ("Third Parties") via an automatic technical process, simply by inserting the e-mail addresses of the Third Parties where indicated ("Tell-A-Friend Pages"). Coors Brewing Company does not collect or retain Third Party e-mail addresses inserted on Tell-A-Friend Pages. However, if your e-mail address is inserted as a Third Party e-mail address by a Web site visitor using a Tell-A-Friend Page, you may receive an e-mail at the request and direction of the visitor via the automatic technical process, even though you may have previously indicated that you do not want to receive e-mail from us. Please note that such e-mails are sent by and at the direction of the Web site visitor, not Coors Brewing Company, and your receipt of such e-mails is not a violation of this Privacy Policy.</p>
