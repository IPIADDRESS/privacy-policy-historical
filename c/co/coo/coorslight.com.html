<p id="how"><strong><u>How We Collect Your Information</u></strong></p>

<p>Coors Brewing Company may obtain information about you from a number of sources to which you provide information or from which you agree we may access your information: our Sites, social media platforms (i.e., Facebook), mobile applications, third-party partners or vendors, at sponsored events, or through surveys, sweepstakes or promotional entries, or our customer call centers. We can also automatically collect information about your computer or device as you browse our Sites.</p>

<p><u>Mobile Applications</u></p>

<p>When you download a Coors Brewing Company mobile application to your mobile device (“Applications”) there may be an opportunity for you to provide us with your personal information. If you choose to share any information with us, we will store it, use it, and share it only in ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Some Applications may collect precise information about the location of your mobile device via the geolocation functionality of your mobile device to provide customized services. You will be given an opportunity to opt in to the collection of this location-based data before it is collected.</p>

<p>You may at any time opt out of the collection of location data or any other data collected by uninstalling the application in accordance with the standard uninstall process made available via your mobile device or the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

<p><u>Tracking Technologies</u></p>

<p>Coors Brewing Company Sites use “cookies” or other tracking devices to remember user preferences and to maximize the performance of our Sites and services, which may include information about your visit (such as demographic data, browser type, IP address, pages viewed, activity conducted on the page, and the timing of your visit).</p>

<p>You may refuse or delete cookies on our Sites. Please refer to your browser Help instructions to learn more about cookies and other tracking devices and how to manage their use. If you elect to refuse or delete cookies, you will need to repeat this process if you use another computer or change browsers. In addition, opting out of relevant advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only those advertisements that are personalized to your interests. If you choose to decline cookies, some of the functionality of our Sites may be impaired.</p>

<p>We do not, without your consent, collect any personal information about your activities on our Sites or across other websites visited prior to or after your activity on our Sites. We also do not, without your consent, permit third parties to collect personal information about your activities on our Sites.</p>

<p>We also advertise Coors Brewing Company products on third-party websites. These websites may use cookies or other tracking devices to collect certain information about your visit. You should carefully review the privacy policies of these third-party sites to understand their tracking activities, if any.</p>

<p><u>Transactions</u></p>

<p>You may purchase merchandise from some of our Sites. This Privacy Policy applies to any personal information you provide in connection with any such purchases. In some instances, you may be directed to a third-party website to initiate your transaction. These third-party websites will be clearly identified and link to their own privacy policies so you know which company is collecting your personal information. You should refer to those policies for any privacy-related concerns regarding your purchase with them.</p>
