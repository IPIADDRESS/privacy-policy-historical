<ul>
<li>Any personal information you give us via forms on the site is treated as confidential and never shared with any third parties except data processors acting on our behalf to provide our services, or where required by law.</li>
<li>By sending us information via a form on this site, you consent to our use of this information as explained on this page.</li>
<li>Your use of this site implies consent for the setting of cookies, unless you change your privacy preferences. For more information on the cookies we use see:&nbsp;<a href="/how-we-use-cookies/" title="How We Use Cookies">How We Use Cookies</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Last Update</strong>: 20 Feb. 2014</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Who We Are</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controller is Cookie Collective LLP of 91-93 Southwark Street, London, SE1 0HX, United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Information we may collect from you&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on this site. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our services, posting material or requesting further services.</li>
<li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
<li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>
</ul>
<p class="sub-heading">Where we store your personal data</p>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers.</p>
<p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Uses made of the information</p>
<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>
<li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>
<li>To allow you to login or participate in interactive features of our online services, when you choose to do so.</li>
<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we may contact you about these by email or telephone.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Email Newsletters</p>
<p>If we send you an email newsletter to the address supplied by you, it will contain tracking images that enable us to see when you open the email. We will also know if you click on any link contained in the email.</p>
<p>We use this information to help us improve the quality and relevance of our communications. If you do not download images in our emails, then we are not able to track when you open or read the emails we send.</p>
<p>You can unsubscribe from any newsletters at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email sent.&nbsp; If you do this we will not send you any more newsletters, however we will keep your details on file in order to be able to comply with this promise.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Optanon Auditor Data Collection</p>
<p>The Optanon Auditor plug-in for Google Chrome gathers data about cookies and submits it to our database.</p>
<p>This data contains information both about the cookies found, and the pages on a particular site they were found on.&nbsp; It also contains values of cookies, which in some circumstances may contain personally identifiable information - if the cookie is designed to hold such information.&nbsp; Such information is only ever used to help us identify the purpose of a cookie, where a website owner has requested this service from us.&nbsp; The data may also be provided to the owner of a website if they request it.</p>
<p>We do not use any personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and nor do we make it available in any other way.</p>
<p>All submissions of data via the Optanon Auditor plug-in are otherwise completely anonymous.&nbsp; No information is collected about the device the plug-in is installed on, or the person using the device.&nbsp; No browsing history, other than a record pf pages that set cookies, is complied, and no profile linked to a device can be created from the data.</p>
<p>The names and some attributes of the cookies gathered by the auditor are made publicly available on the Cookiepedia website.&nbsp; However there is to our knowledge no personally identifiable information contained within this data.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Cookie Collector Plug-ins&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the Optanon Auditor there are two Cookie Collector plug-ins in circulation which submit data about cookies to our database.</p>
<p>Although the old Chrome Collector is no longer available for download, a Firefox Cookie Collector extension is still available in the Mozilla Add-ons store.</p>
<p>Both plug-ins if installed will submit data about cookies to our systems.&nbsp; They do this automatically, without any kind of user input, feedback or control.</p>
<p>The Collector submits only names of cookies and their other attributes, along with the top level domain name of the site being visited by the browser, when the data was submitted.&nbsp; The values (contents) of the cookies are not stored, nor the specific pages of the site they were found on.&nbsp; Therefore no personal data is collected.&nbsp; We do not identify the source of the data submitted - so it cannot be used to build up a browsing history of any person using the Collector.</p>
<p>The sole purpose is to source data about cookies to inform our research.&nbsp; Statistics and other intelligence garnered from analysis of this data are published freely on Cookiepedia.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Disclosure of your information</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Cookie Collective LLP or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms and conditions of supply and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cookie Collective LLP, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p class="sub-heading">Your rights</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. If you would like a copy of the information held on you please write to info@cookielaw.org</p>
<p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p>
<p>Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Links to Other Websites</p>
<p>We may from time to time publish links to other websites we believe to be of interest. However we have no control over these sites, which are not governed by this privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Changes to our privacy policy</p>
<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.</p>
<p class="sub-heading">Contact</p>
<p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to info@cookielaw.org</p>
