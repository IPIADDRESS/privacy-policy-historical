     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Our Use of Your
    Information.</b><br>
    We use your information to facilitate the services you request. We use
    information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we
    obtain from your current and past activities on the site, to resolve
    disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we
    may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and
    in particular we may examine your information to identify users using
    multiple User IDs or aliases.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">You agree that we may use personally identifiable
information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to
analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our
site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our site and better
tailor it to meet your needs.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">You agree that we may use your information to
contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to
your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices,
product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the site. By
accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive

encourage you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications on the

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Our Disclosure of Your
    Information.</b><br>
    Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of
    your private communications and other personally identifiable information
    will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy
    Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced
    to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain
    circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
    transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your
    information that they collect from our site. Therefore, although we use
    industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and
    you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or
    private communications will always remain private.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">As a matter of policy, we <b>do not</b> sell or rent
any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However,
the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable
information may be disclosed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Advertisers.</b> We aggregate (gather up data
across all user accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such
information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other
third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these
situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be
used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email
address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not
disclosed to marketing advertisers ever. If you "right click" with
your mouse on an ad on our site and select properties, you can see the URL for
the advertiser that serves that ad.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Internal Service Providers.</b> We may use
internal service providers to facilitate our services (e.g., search, discussion
boards, surveys) and therefore we may provide some of your personally
identifiable information directly to them. In some instances, the internal
service provider may collect information directly from you (such as the
situation where we ask a internal service provider to conduct a survey for us).
In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service
provider, and all information disclosures you make will be strictly optional. In
all cases, these internal service providers' use of information we supply them
is restricted by confidentiality agreements. If you provide additional
information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your
information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in"><b>Legal Requests.</b> Jdworld.net and its
Affiliates cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third
parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other
rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to
law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion,
believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud,
intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may
expose us or you to legal liability.&nbsp; Additionally, Jdworld.net and its
Affiliates reserves the right (and you authorize us) to communicate any
information about you (including, but not limited to your policy violations), to
other users, law enforcement and other members as we in our sole discretion
determine necessary or appropriate to maintain a level of trust and safety in
our community and to enforce our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and any posted
policies or rules applicable to services you use through our site.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">Jdworld.net and its Affiliates and our users do not
tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed
to add a user, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express
consent after adequate disclosure. To report spam to Jdworld.net, please send an
email to <a href="mailto:admin@jdworld.net">admin@jdworld.net</a>.</p>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Control of Your Password.</b><br>
    You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password.
    Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your login password to any
    third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your
    information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are
    responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password and
    therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose
    control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your
    personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding
    actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been
    compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</li>

     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Changing Your
    Personally Identifiable Information.</b><br>
    You can change your user Id, email address, contact information, shipping information and user preferences by
    sending an email to admin@jdworld.net. You must promptly update your information if it changes. Once
    posted, you may not be able to change or remove any public postings made on
    our site including our chat rooms or other message areas.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">Upon your request, we will deactivate your account,
contact information, shipping information, from our active databases to prevent your information from being
shared with other users. To make this request, email to admin@jdworld.net. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on
your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and
applicable law.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">We will retain in our files information you have
requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes,
troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. Further, such prior
information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and
legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, you
should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be
completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Security.</b><br>
    The Jdworld.net Network and Associates uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of
    your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls" and
    Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected
    against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security
    techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and
    outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on
    the Internet.</li>

     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Conflict of Terms.</b><br>
    It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have
    created easy-to-read summaries, privacy principles, a privacy chart and, are
    working on privacy enhancing technology to help summarize our full privacy
    policy. If you have questions about any part of this summary or if you would
    like more detailed information, we encourage you to send us an email to <a href="mailto:admin@jdworld.net">admin@jdworld.net</a></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Notice.</b><br>
    We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on
    our site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after
    they are initially posted on our site. In addition, we will notify you in
    accordance with your notification preferences.</li>
