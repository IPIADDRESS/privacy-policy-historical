  <br>
  <b>HOW COOKIEMAG.COM USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</b><br>

  such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for 
  the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And if 
  you choose to purchase items through features on our site, we may forward your

  ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While COOKIEMAG.COM will 
  seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and 
  will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose 
  for which it is provided, COOKIEMAG.COM does not bear any responsibility

  we are legally required to provide access to our database in order to cooperate 
  with police investigations or other legal proceedings. In those instances, the 
  information is provided only for that purpose. <br>
  <br>
  While your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve 
  the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about 
  our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends 
  and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. <br>
