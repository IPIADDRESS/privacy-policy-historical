			        <p>CoolMemes.net respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Sites (“Sites”), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information may be used.</p>
<p>Use of Information<br>
<br>
As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or address, is automatically collected from your visit to coolmemes.
