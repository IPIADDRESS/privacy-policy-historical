                    <h2>Instamedia Privacy Policy</h2>
<div>
<p>Instamedia (“Instamedia,” “we,” “us”) is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes our practices in connection with personally identifiable information that we collect through our website located at www.Instamedia.com (the “Site”). This Policy does not govern our collection of information through any web site, or by any other means, other than through the Site, nor does this Policy govern the collection of information by any of our affiliates (collectively, “Affiliated Entities”).</p>
<p>The Site is controlled and operated by Instamedia from the India, and is not intended to subject Instamedia to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the India. Instamedia does not represent or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Policy on the Internet, accessible through the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.</p>
<p>This Policy represents the sole, authorized statement of Instamedia’s practices with respect to the collection of Personal Information (defined below) through the Site and Instamedia’s use of such information. Any summaries of this Policy generated by third party software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the “Platform for Privacy Preferences” or “P3P”) shall have no legal effect, do not bind Instamedia, shall not be relied upon in substitute for this Policy, and neither supersede nor modify this Policy. This Policy is in the English language. Any translation of this Policy shall have no legal validity. In the event of any inconsistency between the English language version hereof and any translation of this Policy into another language, this English language version will govern.</p>
<p>Note Regarding the Use of This Site by Children: The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide personally identifiable information through the Site. Further, we discourage individuals between ages 13 and 18 from using this site absent parental supervision.</p>
<p>1. What Types of Information Does Instamedia Collect Via the Site?</p>
<p>Instamedia gathers two basic types of information through the Site: “Personally Identifiable Information” (or “PII”) and “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” (or “Non-PII”). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as a specific individual; that is, your name, postal address, telephone number, e?mail address, or your credit card number. PII does not include information about any company or organization with which you work, or any newspaper, magazine or other publication with which you may be associated (for example, the name of your employer or publication). In contrast, Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.</p>
<p>a. Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>You do not have to provide PII to us to access the Site. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to apply for membership or participate in surveys, contests, sweepstakes, raffles or other similar promotions), you may require that you furnish PII. We collect PII from you only when you voluntarily provide it to us. Please note, however, that any personally identifiable information contained in any Offered Content (as defined in our Member Terms) – for example, the names of reporters and people featured or quoted in any Offered Content – is considered to be public information, and does not constitute PII under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>When you visit and interact with the Site, Instamedia and third parties with whom Instamedia has contracted to provide services to Instamedia may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages that you visit). Non-PII is generally collected from four different sources: server log files, cookies, clear GIFs and information that you voluntarily provide.</p>
<p>i. Server Log Files.</p>
<p>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
<p>ii. Cookies.</p>
<p>Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual’s computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites, and can facilitate users’ ongoing access to and use of a particular web site. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only the web site that transferred a particular cookie can read, modify or delete such cookie. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer.</p>
<p>iii. Clear GIFs.</p>
<p>Additionally, we or our service providers may use so-called “clear GIFs”, “pixel tags”, “web beacons” or similar means (collectively, “Clear GIFs”) in some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates and help manage our web site reports. A Clear GIF is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site users and may be associated with cookies on our users’ hard drives. These Clear GIFs provide us and our service providers with the ability to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site. Clear GIFs also allow us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Clear GIFs can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.</p>
<p>iv. Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</p>
<p>Instamedia also collects Non-PII (e.g., your interests, your geographic location and so forth) when you voluntarily provide such information to us.</p>
<p>2. How Does Instamedia Use Information Collected on the Site?</p>
<p>a. Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Instamedia may use your PII to provide you with Site related services. Subject to your right to opt-out (see “Opt-Out” section below), we may also use your PII to inform you of content we believe which may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>When you make a purchase through the Site, for example Media Marketplace or PHIP, we may collect your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase (collectively, “Payment Information”) from you, and may use such Payment Information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such Payment Information to third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card). Additionally, if you participate in a purchase made through the Site, either as a buyer/republisher or a seller/licensor, we may provide your PII to any other users who participate in such purchase as necessary to fulfill such purchase (for example, to inform the seller/licensor who the buyer/republisher is, and vice versa). To the extent that Payment Information includes non-PII, use of such non-PII is governed by Section 2.b below.</p>
<p>We may also provide you with the opportunity to complete a survey on the Site. PII collected through surveys will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use of the Site.</p>
<p>We may offer users the opportunity to participate in discussions in Instamedia’ discussion threads. If you use Instamedia’ discussion threads, you should be aware that any PII you submit in any discussion thread (including any PII you may choose to make available to other users through your user profile) becomes public information, and can be read, collected, or used by other users of discussion threads, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the PII you choose to submit in these discussion threads, and we urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, or any other information, in any discussion thread.</p>
<p>From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use your PII to e-mail to you important information regarding the Site, your purchases, issues regarding Offered Content or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies (“Administrative E-mails”). Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving these Administrative E-mails.</p>
<p>Further, notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose your PII if we believe that we are required to do so (a) by law; (b) to comply with legal process or governmental requests; (c) to enforce our Terms of Service; (d) to fulfill our contractual obligations, including fulfilling our users’ audit rights, if any; (e) to protect our operations or those of any Affiliated Entities; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Instamedia, the Affiliated Entities, you or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. Moreover, we may, to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities.</p>
<p>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non?PII, which does not personally identify you, with Affiliated Entities and other third parties, for any purpose.</p>
<p>3. Other Important Notes Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</p>
<p>a. Third Party Service Providers.</p>
<p>We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to web site hosting, data analysis and other services of an administrative nature. We reserve the right to share your PII with such third parties solely for the purpose of enabling such third parties to provide such services.</p>
<p>b. Third Party Advertisers.</p>
<p>We may use third-party contextual and interest-based advertising companies to serve ads when users visit our website, among other services. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Network websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
<p>The third party companies include Google’s DoubleClick that may use a range of information including cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, usage data and other non-personal information about your computer or device (such as browser type and operating system) to provide you with relevant advertising. If you are logged into your Instamedia Account, we may also show you advertising based on the information you have provided to us in your Instamedia Account.</p>
<p>DoubleClick cookie on Instamedia may help advertisers serve ads based on interests associated with non-personally identifiable online activity, such as content or ads viewed or previous activity on advertiser’s website. This non-personally identifiable information is held separately from your Instamedia Account data, or other personally identifying information in our possession.</p>
<p>You may view, edit and add to the categories used to provide you with interest-based advertising in the Ads Preferences Manager.</p>
<p>You also may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time to stop the ads delivered to your browser.</p>
<p>Instamedia does not provide any personal information to third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.</p>
<p>c. Third Party Sites.</p>
<p>The Site may contain links to third party web sites. These linked sites (including without limitation the web sites of Affiliated Entities) are not under Instamedia’ control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Instamedia or any Affiliated Entities. If you provide any PII through any such third party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party’s web site (not the Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.</p>
<p>d. Security.</p>
<p>We seek to maintain reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the PII under our control. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security. As a result, although we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site or that we store on our or our service providers’ systems.</p>
<p>e. Opting-Out.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, send you messages about products and services that we believe would be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to receive such promotional messages, you may unsubscribe from such messages by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of such messages, or by contacting us by e-mail at webmaster@Instamedia.com.</p>
<p>f. Changing or Removing Your PII.</p>
<p>We provide you with several options for reviewing, correcting, updating or otherwise modifying PII that you have previously provided through the Site:</p>
<p>1. You may contact us by e-mail at webmaster[at]Instamedia.com.</p>
<p>2. You may edit your profile by logging into the Instamedia and editing your personal profile.</p>
<p>In each event, you must clearly indicate the information that you wish to have changed, or clearly indicate that you wish to have your PII removed from our database. We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed therefrom. We also reserve the right, from time to time, to re-contact former users of the Site. Finally, we are not responsible for removing information from the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared your PII.</p>
<p>g. Assignment.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any and all PII that we collect from users of the Site to a third party in the event of any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Instamedia’s business.</p>
<p>h. Contacting Us.</p>

However, very few couples actually make it till ‘death do them part’. Here is a list of heartbreaking divorce couples who wish weren’t divorced.            Divorced Celebrity Couples we wish were still together     	Katy Perry and Russell Brand – Pop- music celebrity Katy Perry and English comedian Russell Brand got married in a dream ceremony in Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan, India on 23rd October, 2010 and went ahead to get a divorce soon afterwards in July 2012. It was a heartbreaking divorce because when they first started going out, it just seemed like they were the perfect couple, both complementing each other with their outspoken attitude and humor . Both of them went through a lot of ups and downs as couple and Brand went on to admit that they were incompatible. However, we wish that this couple would make up and be together.        	Heidi Klum and Seal – We thought this couple was forever. They had the perfect storybook romance and seemed to be crazily in love with each other. When this couple announced their split and filed for divorce in April, 2012, it shocked a lot of people. For anyone, they were the perfect loving couple but it seemed that they always put up appearances of being one and were going through a lot of lows before they decided to end it forever. They renewed vows on their wedding anniversaries .The couple was very private and took great pains to not make it public, which, heartbreakingly didn’t work out .        	Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony – Jlo and Marc Anthony were together for seven years and filed for a divorce in July , 2011. They share two children, Max and Emme. Both of them had had previous marriages and several relationships earlier and were secretly married four days after Marc ended his earlier marriage . The duo came to an amicable mutual decision to get a divorce and admitted that it was a hard decision to arrive at. They both care for each other and still maintain a loving nature. It was reported that the divorce was not really what Marc Anthony wanted but that JLo really did not want to go ahead with it. Both of them eventually started dating other people . We wish this couple would not have gotten a divorce . They looked good together , both were romantics and Jlo was quoted to say that Marc made her eat lunch and chill instead of rushing things and pushing herself.

Celebrity Kitchens you’d want to cook in     From clothes to shoes, from their cars to their kitchen, they are doing it right. We bring to you a list of the hottest celebrity kitchens you’d want to cook in and even live in them if possible.        	Will Ferrell – This guy is doing it right. We love him for his humour but his kitchen is certainly no funny business. The combination of white with aesthetically placed and colored stools in brown and blue are a perfect match. We also love the modern art that he has used in this kitchen of his.        	Diane Keaton – This lady has kept it homely and colorful. We are loving the eclectic designs in this kitchen. It is homely and warm and the lovely dishes at the top and the colorful graffiti make it a winner. The quote at the top adds to the feeling of being at home .        	&nbsp;John Legend – We love the dining-table, the stools , the lights and especially that big tree right in the middle of the kitchen ! The pendant lights make this one stand out. One would love to sit down in this kitchen and have a meal.        &nbsp;    	Gerard Butler – With its rustic interiors, this kitchen looks more like it is another part of a medieval castle. The only thing that tells you it is not are the modern appliances. The actor has described his kitchen&nbsp; as “bohemian old-world rustic chateau with a taste of baroque”. One can hardly guess that this wonderful looking kitchen which is a reminder of old times&nbsp; is to be found in the actor’s house in the modern Chelsea neighborhood of New York.        	Sting and Trudy Styler – We love the pristine white in this kitchen also the increased ceiling height from seven feet to nine feet. The lights do wonders and the straw chair and the wood-planks on the floors spell organic which win brownie points. This kitchen is to be found in their townhouse in London.          	Lance Armstrong – This kitchen is done beautifully and is a part of the professional cyclist’s Spanish Colonial-style house situated in Texas. We are loving the brown décor, lights, chairs, shelves, all in synchronized brown and especially the frieze of family photographs that line the top shelves of this kitchen adding a homely feel.&nbsp;  ">Celebrity Kitchens you’d want to cook in</a></li></ul></div><div class="widget"><h2 class="gentesque"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.instablogs.com" title="Syndicate this content"><img style="border:0" width="14" height="14" src="http://www.incrediblediary.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png" alt="RSS"></a> <a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.instablogs.com/" title="">Insta Blogs</a></h2><div class="line">&nbsp;</div><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.instablogs.com/us-adamant-devyani-tormented-and-indian-enraged-whats-next.html" title="Last week Devyani Khobragade, an Indian diplomat was arrested on allegations of visa fraud. India wants U.S. to apologize for the kind of treatment given to the diplomat as well as drop the case against her. Since then there has been considerable outrage in India over the issue and all political parties have come out against this type of behavior from a friendly nation with whom it has strategic alliance. The government has also mentioned that such action where she was handcuffed in public, strip searched, cavity searched and swabbed for DNA was totally against Vienna Convention.            The accusation against Ms. Devyani Khobragade, who is the Deputy Consular General, is that she lied on Sangeeta Richard’s visa application about how much was being paid to her, whom Devyani had hired as maid and, additionally, was not paying the minimum wages and, in addition, forced Sangeeta to work more than forty hours every week. The allegation is that Devyani was paying her housekeeper only about $3, which was far less than the minimum wage in the US.    As retaliation to this arrest, Indian government has taken several steps starting from removal of security barriers that are present outside the US embassy located in Delhi to asking for salary details of Indian staff hired to work for US diplomats in their houses. Indian government has also withdrawn the import licenses, which permitted US embassy’s commissary to import things like food &amp; alcohol.        The political fraternity has come out strongly against this action of the US agencies and leaders, ranging from foreign minister Salman Khurshid to parliamentary affairs minister Kamal Nath, have spoken sturdily about it. MEA officials are not satisfied with just the regret expressed by U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry over a phone call to national security advisor and seek clear apology from US government. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has mentioned that the kind of treatment imparted to Devyani Khobragade was deplorable.    What happens now?    Get Immunity: If U.S. State Department approves the G1 Visa for Devyani, then she will become member of India’s permanent mission of UN, this will provide Khobragade full diplomatic immunity and the charges that have been levied will become irrelevant.    Court Proceedings: However, in case the indictment completes before her visa is granted then the case will go to court and thereafter stretch for few months. If convicted for visa fraud, it could mean ten years sentence and five years for giving false declaration.    As a final note, we can say that this Devyani Khobragade incidence has dented the US-India relations a bit. However, political experts believe that the two governments will be able to sort things out quickly by solving this issue rather than let it stretch and escalate into a major problem.">US adamant, Devyani tormented and Indian enraged… What’s next?</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.instablogs.com/when-india-was-busy-with-core-issues-army-personnel-were-building-course-to-play-golf.html" title="Last year, the Chinese army trespasses a major part of the border area in Arunachal Pradesh. In Kashmir, the Pakistani army has been shelling the borders and in Assam, Irom Charu Sharmila has completed 12 years of fasting to repeal the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA, which is being misused by army personnel to harass civilians.            A new finding of misdemeanour among senior army officials is the unauthorized construction of golf courses in areas marked for building training centres. According to a Parliamentary report, exclusive golf courses for senior officers have been built on valuable government land. Altogether, the army has built 90 “prohibited” golf courses across the country on land designated for various purposes. The public accounts committee report has stipulated that the defence ministry must hold an inquiry into the matter and the officers involved must be brought to book.    It was also revealed that the clubs were rented to civilians for functions such as weddings, parties and receptions. Also, membership to the club was sold to civilians and foreign diplomats. However, the funds generated from these sources have not been declared to the government.        Some of these clubs, such has the 18-hole Delhi army course at DhaulaKuan are very reputed. The DhualaKuan Golf Course has mature trees, ponds, a club house, professional golf shopconcession, pitch and putt practice area and a floodlit driving range. Foreign players are charged around INR 2000 for playing on weekdays and around Rs. 1200 for weekdays, while serving officers pay around INR 50 for the same.    As per the MP reports, commercial charges and use of vast tracts of defence ministry land for activities that are not deemed as military activity, sport or training amount to “gross misuse”. The army chief very conveniently listed ‘golf’ as a sport in 2004 to justify this wanton spending on the courses. The Report questioned his decision and expressed shock on the revenue collected from allowing access to civilians was not credited to the government account.    India is constantly facing security threats from three of its neighbouring countries – Pakistan, China and Bangladesh. The army has done a commendable job in keeping the forces at bay frequently and the political class has been showing a lax attitude towards supporting the army. It has been rendering praiseworthy service by protecting India against external threats, even in remote locations like Siachen, which are inaccessible to humans. On the other hand, the top officials of army have been exploiting their position of power and misusing the provisions that come with the post.    The army is respected for the services and sacrifices it makes for the nation’s goodwill, however, this abuse of power will shake the foundation of all the values it projects and holds.">When India was busy with core issues, army personnel were building course to play golf</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.instablogs.com/womens-safety-is-a-far-cry-until-the-mindset-changes-in-india.html" title="It’s been a year since that fateful night when 23-year old Nirbhaya was brutally raped and killed by five men. Her family and the nation is not completely satisfied by the justice meted out by court as one of the accused, who was a juvenile at that time by a few short months, has just been imprisoned for three years, though the others are to be hanged.            This was not the first rape in India; women are molested every day in this country. Nirbhaya’s case triggered anger that was seething for decades in the minds of Indian women and progressive men. On her first death anniversary, her father said that India would never be safe for women until the society changes its attitudes.    He did not say men, he said society – it includes the men and women of this society. Although women are worshipped as goddesses in temples and festivals, they are treated as a liability and sons are supposed to open the doors of heaven. Even today voices are raised more for crime against women in metros and prominent cities, but no one has paid attention to what is happening all over India, the way women from every strata of the society are being treated.        In the Mumbai gang rape case, it was later revealed by the accused that they had raped women in same spot earlier. The case went unnoticed and unheard of and the police could not trace the unfortunate woman.    In old Indian movies, it was often shown that if a woman was raped her dignity could be salvaged only if she married the rapist. This sounds incredulous, but it is what many of our politicians, god-men, police and even Panchayats believe. In fact, many cases of molestation, eve teasing and rape go unnoticed, because the girl’s family also blames her for what happened. There was an incident in Rajasthan where an eight year old girl was raped by a man and the Panchayat’s judgement was to marry the girl to the rapist’s son. Fortunately her parents had better sensibilities and refused to accept this judgement.    If a woman is eve teased on the roads in India, men snigger and women stare, but no one stands up to her. Women are asked to change the way they dress, their behavior and themselves, but no one tells the man that he is wrong. If there were no women, there would be no men and ergo, no society, India needs to reconsider its attitude towards women.">Women’s safety is a far cry, until the mindset changes in India</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.instablogs.com/jan-lokpal-bill-and-important-things-you-should-know-about-it.html" title="The son-in-law of one of world’s most powerful women, and unfortunately India’s chief ruler of the day, popularly posted one of his misplaced humorous quotes on Facebook calling hapless Indian citizens “mango people of a banana republic”. He has since distanced himself from such stance in public but the glaring reality of it and all other corruption cases that came out thereafter snapped nerves that were already worn out.            It took a popular crusader and social activist like Anna Hazare’s fast-unto-death resolution on Jantar Mantar grounds to send the wake-up call to Indians. His demand – pass the Jan Lokpal Bill, his threat – I’ll die of hunger as the whole nation watches. Delhi had witnessed too many high-profile scams by then and the frustrated nation stood for Anna. He was the prime topic on social media, news channels and in people’s conversation at homes, offices and colleges.    So what is this Jan Lokpal Bill that even celebrities are supporting? It is basically an instrument through which an ombudsman will be chosen as people’s representative to ensure that all corrupt politicians toe the line and account for their actions. No wonder the political class took a break from the slug-fest to form a united front against public scheming.        However, the ruling class is compelled to take Anna’s fasting seriously as their vote bank hangs on his next meal. The idea of a Jan Lokpal Bill is not a new one; a weaker version had been introduced eight times between 1971 and 2005, but never passed in the Rajya Sabha. This time, however, the Bill sees the light of day as the Rajya Sabha has passed it finally.    What will the Lokpal Bill do for us, the common folk? A few significant features of the Lokpal Bill –    	The Lokpal will be set in the Centre while Lokayukta at state-level  	This will be an independent body and will constitute certain judicial powers to grant justice  	Bureaucrats and politicians will not be able to influence its investigations and anyone who has been held guilty will face trial and the investigations will be completed within one year  	The person held guilty will be sent to jail within two years to ensure quick justice  	The Lokpal selection committee will have Prime Minister, Lok Sabha Speaker, opposition leader in Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of India and a fifth member as “eminent jurist” who will be nominated by the President on basis of recommendations from the first four members    As people stand united in the fight against corruption, the political class is losing its propensity to evade the Lokpal Bill and it is expected to be drafted and passed by Independence Day, and hopefully brings freedom in its true sense to this country.">Jan Lokpal Bill and important things you should know about it</a></li></ul></div><div class="widget"><h2 class="gentesque"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.greendiary.com/feed" title="Syndicate this content"><img style="border:0" width="14" height="14" src="http://www.incrediblediary.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png" alt="RSS"></a> <a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.greendiary.com/" title="Let's go green and save the environment for a sustainable future">Green Dairy</a></h2><div class="line">&nbsp;</div><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.greendiary.com/recycling-a-boeing-747-into-a-lovely-and-luxurious-home.html" title="The modern architects are always eager to experiment with the structures, techniques and even materials. As a result there is no dearth of unusual homes made with unconventional materials around the world. Among all the unique homes the one made with the wings of an officially discarded Boeing 747 stands out. David Randall Hertz, a famous American designer and owner of the architecture firm “Studio of Environmental Architecture,” has designed this beautiful home.            David has always been eco-conscious and believed in recycling used materials and scraps for building livable and comfortable homes. Francie Rehwald hired David Hertz to make a home from a recycled Boeing 747 and they both traveled to the Mojave Desert where discarded aircrafts are kept.    The gorgeous house has been built on top of the Malibu hills in California. Hertz candidly admits that he started the project just after toying a little with the idea of using the 2500 square foot Boeing 747 wings on the different parts of a hill top home. It took lots of paperwork to get permission for using the aircraft which was once the property of PAN AM. After Rehwald bought the Boeing pieces for a net $50,000 in the year 2005 the parts were carried in trucks and helicopters to the building site. The lovely house is officially known as the 747 Wing House. It provides some amazing views of the surrounding to the owner and her guests.        The 747 Wing House has been built on a 55 acre land in the Santa Monica Mountains. The main and important parts of the house were built with the help of the wings and other parts were built with the fuselage of the Boeing 747. David’s creativity made this house not just beautiful but also very comfortable. The use of the wings reduced the carbon emissions and turned the construction jobs into eco-friendly tasks. The 50 foot long part of upper fuselage has been turned into the roof of the art studio. The lower fuselage has been used to build the roof of the barn. David has designed the entire house very strategically so that the lovely view of the surrounding is available from all sides.">Recycling a Boeing 747 into a lovely and luxurious home</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.greendiary.com/six-amazing-and-useful-solar-powered-products-manufactured-by-solarway.html" title="It is now a well-known fact that the sun is a never-ending source of renewable energy.

Well, book sculpture is a comparatively newer trend, but it has already left people spell-bound. Let us know about 5 most amazing book sculptors and their grand creations:            Haunting 3D Portraits    These haunting portraits are one of the most remarkable creations of the famous contemporary artist Nicholas Galanin. In his “What Have We Become?” series, this North American sculptor has worked on conceptual art and finally come up with these incredible portraits. They are three-dimensional and perfectly created from hundreds of thousands of pages of various books. We easily get to see and understand different layers of the Native American culture that are hard to put into words through these book sculptures.        Typographic Book Sculptures    If you want to experience ‘richness in simplicity’, you have to explore the awesome typographic book arts of Paul Octavious. It seems that this well-known photographer cum designer has factually tried to give the concept of book arts a real form. The typographic sculptures made by him can be considered as both classy and good-humored. Made out of loads of books, these arts signify a great combination of thoughts, steadiness, and pleasant distraction from the restraints of the real world.        Alphabet    Another wonderful example of amazing book sculpture is the alphabet created by the ‘Bygg Studio’. This exclusive group includes three Royal college of Art grads: Markus Bergström, Hanna Nilsson and Sofia Østerhus. Their creation alphabet is one of the most celebrated book arts and it is known to be the definitive meta-conceptual sculpture made of stacked books.        Storytelling Book Arts    The awe-inspiring sculptures carved out from books by the popular British artist Su Blackwell are enough to bring the scenes as well as characters of a story into life. She just loves to set the whole story free from the desolate b/w landscape of the book in a surprisingly imaginative way. Be the adventure of the ‘Alice in Wonderland’ or the mystery of the ‘Pandora’s Box’, Blackwell has excelled in the way of storytelling through paper.        Surgical Book Sculptures    Surgical book sculptures are absolutely different from all other types of book arts. It was the renowned surgical sculptor Brian Dettmer who presented these meticulously created sculptures to the world and earned a lot of appreciation. He needed different tools like surgical clamos, tweezers, Xacto knives, etc. to come up with his exclusive pop arts. It is truly said that his sculptures are the ‘epitome of architectured whimsy’.">Five awesome book sculptures – Arts and artists</a></li></ul></div>

More and more people prefer Twitter to any other social networking site. You can meet interesting people, find out what’s hot and making news, market yourself, your business and what not! So, are you making the most of it?            How to make the most of Twitter    	Find out what it is about – Before signing up, which is free , you can go to Twitter.com and check out the flow of tweets of a particular user at their username. You can get a vague idea of what it is all about. However, signing up is not a bad idea in the first place, just create an account and check out what others are doing. You do not HAVE TO tweet anything or follow anyone or let anyone follow you. Get a feel of it.  	Get the program – You can get the program for your particular system, PC, MAC or even your mobile phone. For Windows it is Madtwitter, Twitteroo, Twitterlicious, for MAC OS X it is Twitterific, for mobile phones it is Twitter for iPhone , Twitterberry for Blackberries. Getting a program will give you a better idea of the flow of tweets and an even quicker overview.  	Whom to follow? – Whoshouldifollow.com is the answer. Based on your username, it will look for people whom you might want to follow on Twitter. Twitdir.com is a cool directory for you to find out interesting fellow Twittermen wherein you get a whole list of the top 100 most-followed twitterers.

Summize.com allows you to type in a word or a phrase and searches all of Twitter’s feeds to find if there is any tweet on it. An RSS feed will update you whenever any new tweet has been posted regarding your search word or phrase.  	How do I share stuff ? – Twitthis.com allows other people to share the URL of your site or blog via Twitter.  	Keep it real – Twitter is preferred because it rapid and gives the user real-time data. It is informative and keeps the user up-to-date with what is happening. If you want to be a smart Twitter member, you have to keep it real. Post stuff which is trending right now, at that moment.

There are ways in which you can make it successful.            How to have a successful blind date    	Set your criteria – When people are trying to set you up on a blind date, tell them what you like and you don’t. This will save you a lot of time and effort and minimize the chances of the date turning into a horrifying experience. If you are looking for someone taller than yourself, tell them, if you cannot stand someone who has an opposite political ideology , then tell the matchmakers to keep in&nbsp; mind that particular thing when they think someone would make a perfect match for you and try to set you up on a date. If you like men who dress well and talk well and belong to a particular field that you too are interested in, do not be afraid of sounding too shallow if you tell the matchmakers that. It just goes on to say that you know what you want and would rather not waste time running after ‘what ifs ? ’ However, make sure that you know what qualities in your list of criteria are must-haves and what are not. Expecting a guy to meet all of them is unrealistic.  	Find out about the ‘guy’ – Just a ‘He’s going to be great for you!’ or ‘You two are gonna be a great match!’ is not enough to go out on a date . Other people’s list of criteria will never match yours. So find out more about the prospective date, find out what he does on weekends, what is&nbsp; his social networking like, if he has a lot of friends, etc. You also need to find out if the guy is really looking for a relationship or just a fling, if he has recently been through a break up or separation and is on the rebound. There is no point saying ‘yes’ to a date with a person with whom there is clearly no future.  	A really bad date – There is absolutely no reason to panic if the guy you have been set up with or you have yourself arranged to go for a blind date with turns out to be nothing like the one you had in mind . Always keep yourself open to surprises. However, if the date turns out to be a horror , make a run for the door! You can pretend to take a call, come back and tell him you have an ‘emergency’ or be very clear , politely, that the date is not going how you were hoping it would. Whatever it may be, do not hide what you are feeling and be honest.

There are ways in which you can avoid it.            How to avoid being scammed online    The internet is both a blessing and a curse with easy information available online as well as fast information transfer. Some people use it for networking while some even to make money at home. However, with the recent rise in internet fraud cases, it is essential that you are not robbed of your money or someone doesn’t steal your personal information and use it for other means. We advise you how to deal with avoiding internet scams.    	Be suspicious – Always be alert regarding emails sent from unknown sources or people you do not know. If they offer you a job where you require no qualifications but just a bank account details to transfer money to, if they inform you that you have won a lottery worth millions of dollars without you taking part in many, delete all such emails. They are too good to be true and they are. These websites want to steal your personal information and scam you into paying up for things . Also do not go by the way the website looks at first glance. Scammers put in a lot of effort in designing websites to look genuine.  	Be wary of phising – Learn to recognize phising emails which ask you for your bank account details, PIN, password, etc, be it for any purpose. Do not be pushed into urgency with phrases like ‘ Your bank account will be closed otherwise’ or messages to incite greed like ‘A large sum of money has been debited and we require your password’ . Take your time and double check with your bank instead of relying on emails. Banks never ask you for personal information via emails neither do they conduct any business online.  	NEVER –&nbsp; Never share your personal details. Never open links in such mails. Never open email-attachments of such mails, it might contain a virus that might wipe out your system or steal your details from your computer. Use your computer’s network connection while opening the file or download and save it to your hard drive, run a scan on the file and only then open it.  	ALWAYS – Always use a spam filter for your emails. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware on your computer. Use a firewall to give and activate it to give you protection.

You might feel overburdened with all the work, cleaning, shopping, partying, etc. Learn to deal with those with some simple tips.            How to beat holiday stress    	Reach out and share – You might feel like you are the only one who is feeling down and depressed instead of joyous like everybody else. That is not true. Holidays leave a lot of people depressed. Reach out to people and share in the festivities. Do not isolate yourself. If you are mourning a recent event of sadness in your life, the death of a close one, a break-up or separation, there is no need to push yourself just because it is the holiday season.  	Prepare in advance – Doing things at the last minute will always leave you stressed and you will not be able to accomplish anything. Start cleaning and shopping well in advance. Send out invitations and start making calls beforehand. List down all you have to do and prioritize .Take one step at a time and do not rush yourself.  	Prepare your budget – Prepare a budget and stick to it. You do not need to go overboard with any expenses. Gifts cannot buy you happiness and love. People appreciate the value of a gift more if it is thoughtful, not if it is expensive.  	Accept reality – Many people are overwhelmed by nostalgia in the holiday season, how things took place earlier, how old traditions were better. Accept change with welcoming arms. Traditions keep changing so make new ones instead of sticking to the old because people change as well. If you keep comparing the present to the old, you will never be able to set aside the holiday blues.  	Set aside differences – Holidays are a time for cheer and festivities. Set aside all your differences and celebrate being together. Forget that there is some ill-feeling and make amends. Do not expect too much from your family or friends. Make them feel like they belong. If someone is not reaching out, chances are he/she might be reeling under the holiday blues too. Learn to not stress over it and allow them their space.  	Do not rush yourself – You might feel overburdened with all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, calling, etc. It is important to step down sometimes and take some time to breathe. Learn to chill, listen to soothing music and take breaks.
