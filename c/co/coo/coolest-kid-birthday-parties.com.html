    <p>We recognize that your privacy is important. This document
      outlines the types of personal information we receive and 
      collect when you use the network of <em>Shippony Group Nevada, Inc.</em> sites (including www.coolest-parties.com, www.coolest-kid-birthday-parties.com, www.coolest-birthday-cakes.com, www.coolest-homemade-costumes.com, www.coolest-holiday-parties.com, www.coolest-baby-showers.com, coolest-free-printables.com, my-sbi-adventure.com). This document also outlines  some 
      of the steps we take to safeguard information. We hope this 
      will help you make an informed decision about sharing 
    personal information with us.</p>
    <p><em>Shippony Group Nevada, Inc.</em>  strives to maintain the highest 
      standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all our 
      operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to protecting our 
      customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our 
      website.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p><em>Shippony Group Nevada, Inc.</em> collects personally identifiable 
      information from the visitors to our website only on a 
      voluntary basis. Personal information collected on a 
      voluntary basis may include name, postal address, email 
      address, company name and telephone number.</p>
    <p>This information is collected if you request information 
      from us, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, and sign 
      up to join our email list or request some other service or 
      information from us. The information collected is internally 
      reviewed, used to improve the content of our website, notify 
      our visitors of updates, and respond to visitor inquiries.</p>
    <p>Once information is reviewed, it is discarded or stored in 
      our files. If we make material changes in the collection of 
      personally identifiable information we will inform you by 
      placing a notice on our site. Personal information received 
      from any visitor will be used only for internal purposes and 
      will not be sold or provided to third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
    <p>We may use cookies to help you personalize your online 
      experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to 
      your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to 
      enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of 
      a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to 
      a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites 
      pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie 
      enables <em>Shippony Group Nevada, Inc.</em> to recall your specific 
      information on subsequent visits.</p>
    <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by 
      modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to 
      decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the 
      interactive features of the site.</p>
    <p>A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor 
      your journey around a single website or collection of sites. 
      They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used 
      by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. 
      They may be used in association with cookies to understand 
      how visitors interact with the pages and content on the 
      pages of a web site.</p>
    <p>We may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and 
      web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web 
      site to ascertain how many times you've seen an 
      advertisement. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">click here</a>. No personally identifiable information you 
      give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so 
      they cannot personally identify you with that information on 
      our web site.</p>
    <p>Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify 
      you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be 
      used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions 
      shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so 
      choose.</p>
