	   <h3>Co-Optimus - Web Site Privacy Policy</h3>
	   <p>This privacy policy describes the Co-Optimus’s current policies and practices with regard to personal data collected by the Co-Optimus through this web site. This privacy policy does not apply to information collected offline or in any other way. The term "personal data" refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, and any other information that identifies you personally.</p>

	<p>Your Consent. By using this web site or any Co-Optimus Web site, you consent to our use of your personal data as described in this privacy policy.</p>

 <p>Notification Of Changes To This Policy. The Co-Optimus is continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this web site and improving and adding to its existing services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law and the changing nature of technology, the Co-Optimus’s data practices will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change, the Co-Optimus will post the changes on this web site to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently.</p>

 <p>The Co-Optimus may share the personal information you provide to us with consultants and other third parties who act for or on behalf of the Co-Optimus, for further processing or analysis. In addition, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which the Co-Optimus may share or transfer the personal information in its databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this web site, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event.</p>

 <p>Anonymous Data Collected Through Co-Optimus Websites. In addition to the information you provide when you use our web site, The Co-Optimus uses technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our web site.
