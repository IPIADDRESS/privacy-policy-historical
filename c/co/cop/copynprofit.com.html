									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">CHAMP may place Internet cookies on your hard drive.&nbsp; Internet cookies are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; Cookies are used to (a)&nbsp;remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service; (b)&nbsp;estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior; (c)&nbsp;track your progress and entries in promotions, sweepstakes and contests, if any; and (d)&nbsp;measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our users’ habits are similar or different from one another.&nbsp; You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.&nbsp; By not accepting cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">CHAMP may also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous.&nbsp; We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there.&nbsp; In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you.</font></p>
									<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. How is my information used?</font></b></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">CHAMP will not provide your personally identifiable information to others without your consent.&nbsp; The information you provide will be used to support your customer relationship with CHAMP.&nbsp; Your information may be shared with agents, contractors or business partners for the purpose of performing services for CHAMP.&nbsp;</font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We want to help you quickly find information on CHAMP and alert you to specific offers, updated information, and other new products and services from CHAMP.&nbsp; Accordingly, we may send you email, direct mailings or contact you by telephone about our various products and services or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply “opt-out” by the means provided for in the mailings or by contacting <a href="mailto:producerjamie@yahoo.com">producerjamie@yahoo.com</a>.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Notwithstanding, CHAMP does research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior based on the information provided to us during your use of the CHAMP Web site.&nbsp; This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.&nbsp; Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information.&nbsp; CHAMP may share this aggregated data with others.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">From time to time affiliates of CHAMP may have special offers for customers of CHAMP. In such cases you will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and receive additional information about those offers. In such cases by electing to receive information from CHAMP affiliates your information will be transferred to those third parties. The information practices of those third parties are not covered by this privacy statement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
									<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. Who is collecting my information?</font></b></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When you are on an CHAMP site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with CHAMP alone, unless specifically stated otherwise.&nbsp; If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than CHAMP or an agent for CHAMP, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.&nbsp; If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or purchasing those particular goods.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Please be aware that CHAMP advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp; The information practices of those Web sites linked to CHAMP either through advertisements or other hyperlinks are not covered by this privacy statement and CHAMP shall have no liability for the actions and policies of these third parties.</font></p>
									<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">5. With whom does CHAMP share my information?</font></b></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We may share the personal data you provide with other CHAMP agents, contractors or our business partners for the purposes of performing services for CHAMP.&nbsp; CHAMP also may share aggregated data with others.&nbsp; Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We also believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Access, or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp; Except as provided above or in the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of CHAMP’s assets, we will not share any of your information with any third party without your permission.&nbsp;</font></p>
									<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">6. How do I access, update or delete my information?</font></b></p>

									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">7. <b>What does “opt-out” mean?</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To “opt-out” means that you have notified CHAMP that we no longer have permission to use your information to contact you regarding promotions of other CHAMP products. For example, when we send you information on a new product, you will be given the opportunity to “opt-out” of receiving such information in the future.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">8. <b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></font></p>
