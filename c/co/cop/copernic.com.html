<p>Copernic Inc. respects your right to  privacy. We understand the sensitive nature of privacy issues and the company  takes measures to ensure that the confidentiality of our clients and web users  is protected. Copernic Inc. does not distribute, sell, or rent any of the  information collected about our website users or clients. </p>
<p>By using the Copernic Inc. site and  services, you indicate your agreement to the collection and use of your  information by Copernic Inc. as outlined in this privacy policy. Please note  that this policy is subject to change and updates will be posted on this page  when there has been a change, or a new service or product has been added to our  offerings from time to time. We therefore encourage you to visit it  periodically to review our practices and updates.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage </strong><br>
This policy applies to the collection, use,  storage and disclosure of information by Copernic Inc. It applies to <a href="http://www.copernic.com">www.copernic.com</a>, <a href="http://www.copernicmediasolutions.com">www.copernicmediasolutions.com</a>,  clients.copernicmediasolutions.com, www.mammamediasolutions.com,  www.mamamediasolutions.com, www.mammainc.com, www.mamainc.com, www.mamma.com,  www.mama.com and clients.mamma.com or to any site including "Copernic",  "Mamma Media Solutions" or "Mamma.com" in its URL, and  which includes a link to this privacy policy. The presence of the Copernic Inc.  or Mamma logo alone does not guarantee the applicability of this policy, as  many of our clients run their own, wholly separate sites, and that have their  own privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Links  to Other Sites </strong><br>
As a provider of advertising and publisher  services, you will find various links on our sites and clients' sites,  including but not limited to: Copernic/Mamma Classifieds, Sponsored Listings, Copernic/Mamma's  Partners, sundry banners, pops, interstitials, etc. The sites these all link to  are owned and maintained by independent companies, over which Copernic Inc. has  no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Copernic Inc. is  not responsible or liable for the content of these sites, or their collection  of information and its use. If you have any concerns about your privacy at one  of these sites, please review their sites' policies or contact them directly.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies  &amp; Web Beacons </strong><br>
Cookies and web beacons are small files  that are downloaded to your computer, and that allow Copernic Inc. to collect  aggregate statistical information. They are not in any way harmful to your  computer, nor are they capable of personally identifying you. Rather, they are  only capable of collecting anonymous information, and letting us know basic  information about your visit.</p>
<p>COOKIES: A cookie is a small piece of data  that is delivered to your computers' hard drive when you visit a site run by Copernic  Inc., or that includes advertisements or search results served by us on another  site. No personal information is stored within the cookie. It is an anonymous  piece of data that simply identifies your computers' IP address by assigning it  a unique number. It does not identify you, personally, but rather it identifies  your computer as a "unique user."</p>
<p>By identifying your computer as a unique  user, cookies let us know when you return to our site, or when you view the  same advertisement repeatedly. In doing so, we can use the cookie to limit the  number of times you see a particular advertisement, to avoid frustration. Copernic  Inc. can also use the information stored in the cookie to serve more relevant  advertising to your computer. In a more general scope, cookies permit Copernic  Inc. to gauge the reach of an advertising campaign, the number of times an  advertisement or search result is displayed, searched for or clicked on, how  often a unique user visits our sites or partners' sites, and how they're  interacting with them. Overall, cookies permit us to track user trends,  preferences and patterns.</p>
<p>You can choose to accept or refuse cookies  by changing the settings of your browser. Or, you can opt to be warned before a  cookie is deposited on your computer. It should be noted, however, that some  features or services offered by Copernic Inc. might not work properly if  cookies are turned off. You can also choose to periodically delete cookies from  your computers' hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been  saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be  recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site, or being  exposed to advertisements.</p>
<p>WEB BEACONS: Web beacons, also known as web  bugs or pixel tags are tiny 1x1 pixel GIFs (Graphical Interchange Format) or  images that are placed on some of Copernic Inc.' client websites, but are so  tiny that you can't see them. Their purpose is to help measure and analyze the  usage patterns visitors have on their website, and the effectiveness of the  advertising campaigns that brought them there. In essence, web beacons tell us  that an event has occurred, for instance that something was clicked upon,  submitted or purchased, but it conveys no real details about that event, nor  does it provide any personally identifiable information about the user that  initiated it. </p>
<p><strong>Information  Collected </strong><br>
By using any of Copernic Inc. sites, or its  clients' sites, you will be providing Copernic Inc. with certain limited  anonymous information, based on your activities. This information cannot be  traced back to you, or matched up to personally identifying information in any  way - it is completely anonymous, and will only be used in aggregate form with  the information collected from other site visitors. Should you choose to  correspond with, or participate in any of Copernic Inc.' services or products,  however, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information, in  order that we may respond, or do business with you. Please see below for more  details on the kinds of anonymous and identifiable information Copernic Inc.  collects.</p>
<p>ANONYMOUS: When a user visits Copernic Inc.,  Mamma.com, or one of its search or graphic ad publishers' sites, they leave a  "trail" of electronic information, which is collected and stored on  our servers. This information, often referred to as traffic, or click-stream,  data is not personally identifiable nor is it possible to combine with any kind  of identifiable information we may collect from you by other means (see  Personally Identifiable Information, below). Rather, click-stream data consists  of very limited and specific information about your computer, your browser, and  its activities. For example: your computer's IP address, its operating system,  the type and version of your browser, the date and time, the length of time  spent on each page, search terms, results or advertisements clicked upon, and  referral data.</p>
<p>This anonymous information is used to  monitor our traffic and servers, as well as to screen for fraudulent behavior  or abnormalities. It is also used to compile statistics and perform research by  analyzing it in aggregate form, which in turn helps us to improve our services  and offerings to both users of our sites and services.</p>
<p>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION: In  certain limited circumstances, Copernic Inc. may gain access to your personally  identifiable information. This information is made available to Copernic Inc.  voluntarily, when a user or potential client specifically and knowingly  provides it to us, in order to correspond with us, or to receive a service  they've requested.</p>
<p>1. Correspondence: When a site user or  potential client gives comments, questions, information requests, or feedback  to Copernic Inc. by phone, mail, or email (either directly or through one of  our online forms) and includes an email address and/or contact information, Copernic  Inc. will use this information in order to respond. The contact information  provided, however, is not stored in any kind of database. It is only maintained  as a record of past correspondence, either in the responders' files or sent  items in their email software.</p>
<p>2. Special Offers: When you participate in  special offers, contests, or surveys, the collection of contact information is  often required for registration, and for winner notification. In some  instances, these are co-sponsored and so your information will be shared with  that particular partner.</p>
<p>Please note, that some contests or services  advertised on or through Copernic Inc., by either search or graphic  advertisers, may require personal contact information in order to enter or  register. This information is not shared with Copernic Inc., and these  advertisers are not covered by this privacy policy (please see Links to Other  Sites, above) although they may adhere to their own similar policies.</p>
<p>3. Registration/Application for Services:  Advertisers or site owners who wish to advertise through Copernic Inc. or join  the Copernic Inc. search or graphic ad publisher network will be requested to  provide personally identifiable and financial information in order to  participate in these programs. The collection of this information is part of  regular business practices and is necessary in order to complete transactions  and properly run and administer these services. Should anyone be uncomfortable  providing this information to Copernic Inc., they can choose not to  participate.</p>
<p>Information collected during the  registration or application processes, include: company name, name, email,  physical address, and phone number. Advertisers may also be asked to provide  credit card information in order to process and authorize payments to Copernic  Inc. for services rendered, and publishers may be asked to provide either their  Social Security Number or Federal Tax ID Number in order to receive payments for  impressions or clicks delivered on their sites. Overall, personally  identifiable information of Copernic Inc. clients is used for administrative  needs, to maintain account information, and to process billing and payments. </p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited  Contact &amp; Communication </strong><br>
Copernic Inc. will not sell, rent, or  disclose any of the contact information we have collected from you to third  parties, except as described in this document (see Special Offers, above and  Information Sharing, below).</p>
<p>We, however, may occasionally wish to  communicate with our customers in order to provide them with information  relevant to the services we provide or the management of their accounts. This  might include newsletters, or notices of new services or offers from Copernic  Inc. or selected partners that could be of interest. In addition, we will  provide clients with their initial activation and welcome email, service and  system updates, account and balance warnings, confirmation emails, and quality  approval notifications.</p>
<p>As part of our service, our Customer  Service Department routinely communicates with members by phone or email to  respond to questions or issues relating to their account, or to offer  optimization services. We may also solicit some of our clients from time to  time, either online or by email, to participate in client surveys.  Participation in these surveys is voluntary, and the information collected  provides Copernic Inc. with valuable feedback on our services, which in turn,  helps us to improve them.</p>
<p>Copernic Inc. respects your right to  unsubscribe from our company offers and newsletters at any time. To do so, <a href="../../contact/index.html">please contact our  Customer Service Department</a>. Please note, that this does not include  status or confirmation emails related to your account activity.</p>
<p><strong>Information  Sharing </strong><br>
Copernic Inc. may share the information we  gather from cookies, web beacons, survey respondents, etc., with advertisers,  business partners, sponsors, and other selected third parties. This sharing of  information is done only in an aggregate form for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>Your personally identifiable information,  submitted during your registration or application, is shared only with third  party companies who provide Copernic Inc. with administrative services required  to conduct business with our clients and provide them with the services they  have signed up for. Examples include: technical consultants; third-party credit  card processing; credit checks; money transfers and auditing. Under no  circumstances do these service partners or Copernic Inc. disclose any of your  personally identifiable information, unless we are obligated to do so by law  (due to a court order, subpoena, etc), or to protect Copernic Inc., our users,  or the general public.</p>
<p>Copernic Inc. may identify some of our  clients as current or past advertisers or publishers on gallery pages on the Copernic  Inc. website. Identification of our clients will be in the form of their  business identity, or brand, only.</p>
<p><strong>Security </strong><br>
Any data collected and stored on Copernic  Inc.' servers is considered proprietary and confidential, and is not available  to the public. We have security measures in place to help protect against the  loss, misuse and alteration of user and customer data under our control. As  data security is constantly evolving, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or  alteration of the data will not occur, but will do our utmost to prevent  against any such occurrences.</p>
<p>Clients' personally identifiable  information is password protected and restricted within our organization to  employees that need access to this information in order to correspond with you,  operate the website or a particular service.</p>
<p><strong>Children  Under 13 Years of Age </strong><br>
In light of the concern over protecting  children's privacy online, Copernic Inc. does not knowingly request, collect,  or share personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13.  Our websites, products and services are neither developed for, nor directed at,  children.</p>
