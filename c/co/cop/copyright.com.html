    <p>This privacy policy was last updated on 10/31/2005.</p>
    <p>By using the www.copyright.com Web site or any other Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) Web-based service, you agree to the terms of the CCC Online Privacy Policy, as outlined below. </p>
    <h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>
    <p>You may access and read most material on CCC’s Web sites without giving us any information that identifies you. However, when you engage in certain activities on these Web sites, such as seeking and receiving permissions, authorizations or licenses to use the copyrighted works of the copyright rightsholders we represent, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself and/or your organization by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to fill out the form and/or engage in these activities. Should you choose not to do so, however, it may not be possible for CCC to provide the permission, authorization or license that you are seeking.</p>
    <p>Should you choose to take advantage of our services, we may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, organization name, mailing address, e-mail address and other identifying information. Should you choose to pay with a credit card, you may be asked to provide a card number, expiration date, and the name and address of the cardholder. For more information about data security, please see the Security section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>CCC collects all of this information in order to record and support your licensing and other activities. For example, we may use the information you provide to verify the details of a license issued to you or to keep you informed about our products and services. We may supplement the information you provide with commercially available demographic and address information in order to enhance our ability to serve you. </p>
    <p>Please note that in some cases you may access CCC's services through the Web site of a participating copyright rightsholder, such as a publisher, or one of our integration partners, such as a course management system provider. In those cases, you will be directed to a Web page within a CCC Web site and it is CCC which will be collecting your information, even though you may continue to see the copyright rightsholder's branding or logo. CCC will share information with the copyright rightsholder as described in the Use of Personal Information section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
    <p>CCC shares the information that you provide to us in accordance with our obligations to copyright rightsholders to identify uses of their copyrighted materials. These obligations vary from CCC program to program. Details about such obligations under any particular CCC program are available upon request. CCC does NOT, however, share information with copyright rightsholders (i) about credit card details, or (ii) about the use of OTHER copyright rightsholders' copyrighted materials. </p>
    <p>If you have identified yourself, or are identified by your employer to CCC as being associated with a CCC-participating organization, you may receive promotional communications from CCC either directly from us or through your participating organization. Further, when you use your organization's credit card or CCC billing account to transact business with us, the organization will receive information about the materials you have used and reported to CCC. Similarly, in circumstances where multiple individuals associated with the same organization share a single CCC account or a single user name and password, each individual may have access to information provided by the other individuals on the same account.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may use outside shipping and printing companies to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use the personally identifiable information that they receive from CCC for any other purposes.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.</p>
    <p>CCC recognizes and appreciates the importance of the responsible use of your personal information. Except as disclosed above or in published lists of consenting customers, we do not release or sell lists of our customer names to outside organizations. Further, your personal information is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access to it. Finally, when you submit personal information to CCC, you understand and agree that CCC and its subsidiaries, affiliates and trusted vendors may transfer, store and process your customer profile in any country in which we do business, including but not limited to the United States. </p>
    <p>Please be advised that CCC is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any other Web sites to which copyright.com or any other CCC Web site may link.</p>
    <h3>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies </h3>
    <p>When you visit copyright.com or any other CCC Web site, you can surf the site without revealing your identity. In order to improve our sites and our services, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small string of data that is transferred to your browser from a Web site and can only be read by the Web site that gave it to you. If you have identified yourself to the Web site, the cookie acts as an identification card, recording your passwords and preferences, and possibly your license status. The cookie cannot be executed as software code or used to deliver viruses.</p>
    <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to accept it or not. CCC's Web-based offerings include a few Web pages that are inaccessible without a cookie. These pages are associated with an automated log-in feature that allows you to access your account information while bypassing the need to provide your identity and password each time. You are not required to use the automated log-in feature. Choosing not to use it will not affect your ability to use any other part of our Web-based offerings or to use CCC's general services. In the event that CCC decides to create other Web-based offerings that are inaccessible without a cookie (which CCC reserves the right to do), you will be given the option to accept the cookie necessary for such access. </p>
    <p>As with most Web sites, CCC also gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, a date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not include personally identifiable information, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
    <p>We also employ a software technology called pixel tags (also known as Web beacons) that help us better manage content on our Web site and in other electronic communications by indicating what content is most effective. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages and in other electronic communications. </p>
    <p>When you accept our cookies, we use them to track your visit to any CCC Web offering. In addition, we use log files and clear gifs to help manage our Web site and other electronic communications. However, none of this information, other than the automated log-in feature, identifies you personally or is tied to any of your personally identifiable information. You remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided CCC with personal information.</p>
    <h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site or share our communications, such as an e-newsletter, we will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address. We will automatically forward the content to your friend in a one-time e-mail. CCC maintains statistical data tracking the success of our referral program, but we do not store your tell-a-friend information after sending the one-time e-mail. We will store information provided by your friend should s/he choose to receive information from us.</p>
    <h3>Changing Our Records of Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>You have the right to correct your personal information. This may be accomplished either directly on our Web site on those screens that allow you to edit your personal information; by writing to CCC at: Copyright Clearance Center, Inc., Customer Relations Department, 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, USA; or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@copyright.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy"><em>info@copyright.com</em></a>. When you contact us please include your name, address and/or e-mail address, account number (if known) and a detailed explanation of your request.</p>
    <h3>Opting Out of Receiving Information from CCC</h3>
    <p>Copyright Clearance Center follows industry standard safe unsubscribe practices. You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications and newsletters from CCC by following the "unsubscribe" instructions that come with each message from us. In addition, you may opt out of receiving such communications by writing to us at: Copyright Clearance Center, Inc., Marketing Department, 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, USA; by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:marketing@copyright.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy"><em>marketing@copyright.com</em></a>; or by telephoning us at 978-750-8400 and asking to speak with the Marketing Department Administrator.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. The password that protects your personal information, as well as your credit card information, are encrypted during transmission using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, which is widely used on the Internet for this purpose. These data are also stored in encrypted form. </p>
    <p>CCC adheres to generally accepted industry standards to protect this information, both during transmission and once we receive it. These standards include the use of leading hardware and software applications. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your applicable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@copyright.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy"><em>info@copyright.com</em></a>. </p>
    <h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
    <p>CCC is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers CCC’s primary Web site, <a href="http://www.copyright.com"><em>www.copyright.com</em></a>, and various marketing Web sites created and maintained by CCC. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@copyright.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy"><em>info@copyright.com</em></a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php"><em>http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</em></a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>
    <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>When we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by posting a notice on the homepage of www.copyright.com for 30 days that the policy has been updated and by changing the date on this page noting when the policy was last updated. </p>
    <p>This privacy policy was last updated on 10/31/2005.</p>
