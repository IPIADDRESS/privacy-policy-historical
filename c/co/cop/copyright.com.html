              By using the copyright.com web site or any other CCC web site, you
              agree to the terms of the CCC Online Privacy Policy, as outlined
              below. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not

              Information</b></font><font size="2"><br>
              You may access and read most of our web sites without giving us
              any information that identifies you. However, when you engage in
              certain activities on these web sites, such as seeking and receiving
              permissions, authorizations or licenses to use the copyrighted
              works of the copyright rightsholders CCC represents, CCC may ask
              you to provide certain information about yourself and/or your
              organization by filling out and submitting an online form. It is
              completely optional for you to fill out the form and/or engage in
              these activities. Should you choose not to do so, however, it may
              be impossible for CCC to provide the license that you are seeking.
              On the other hand, should you do so, CCC may require that you
              provide us with personal information, such as your name,
              organization name, mailing address, e-mail address and other
              identifying information. Further, should you choose to use a
              credit or debit card to pay CCC, you may be asked to provide a
              card number, expiration date and name of cardholder.
              </font></p><p><font size="2">CCC collects this information in order to record and support
              your participation in the activities you select. For example, CCC
              may use the information that you provide in order to verify the
              details of any license issued to you or in order to keep you
              informed about CCC products and services. Among other things, CCC
              uses the information in accordance with its obligations to
              participating rightsholders to identify uses of copyrighted
              materials provided by those rightsholders, which obligations vary
              from CCC program to program. Details about such obligations under
              any particular CCC program are available from CCC upon request.
              CCC does not, however, share information with rightsholders (i)
              about individuals within CCC's organizational customers, (ii)
              about credit or debit card details, or (iii) about the use of
              OTHER rightsholders' copyrighted materials.</font></p><font size="2">
              <p>CCC recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible
              use of this information. Therefore, except as disclosed above, we
              do not release or sell lists of our customer names to any outside
              organization. Further, your personal information is
              password-protected to prevent unauthorized access to it. This
              password is encrypted; we recommend that you not disclose your
              password to anyone. Finally, when you submit personal information
              to CCC, you understand and agree that CCC and its subsidiaries,
              affiliates and trusted vendors may transfer, store and process
              your customer profile in any country in which we do business,

              as an identification card, recording your passwords and
              preferences (if you have identified yourself to the web site) and
              possibly your license status. It cannot be executed as software
