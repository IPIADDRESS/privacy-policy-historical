            <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Costamar.com respects your privacy,
            and we want you to understand the ways in which we do and don't use
            the information that you transmit when you visit our Web site.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Basics<br>
            The information gathered by Costamar.com falls into two categories:
            (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our Web sites
            through optional registration and (2) tracking information routinely
            gathered as visitors navigate through our sites.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            To make use of certain features on our Web sites visitors need to
            register and to provide certain information as part of the
            registration process. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email
            address, gender, age and zip code.) The information you supply will
            help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites
            to your interests and to make them more useful to you.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer
            you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you
            don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide
            you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites.
            For example, we can't offer you online travel reservations without
            knowing how to book your trip. And we can't send you email alerting
            you to any new service we're offering or breaking news that may
            interest you if you don't tell us your preferences and give us your
            email address. Similarly, we can't notify you that you've been lucky
            enough to win a prize in a promotional contest if we don't know how
            to contact you.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're
            still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on
            our sites without registration.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Cookies<br>
            To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors,
            we invoke a standard feature found in browser software, called a
            "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number,
            a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on your computer. The
            cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that
            a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify
            yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you
            are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
            information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie
            can't read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign
            their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver
            a better, more personalized service. In addition, we may use cookies
            to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. We can build a
            better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how
            often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies,
            but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the
            personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to our sites.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            IP Addresses<br>
            Our Web servers automatically collect limited information about your
            computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address,
            when you visit our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets
            computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -
            such as the Web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify
            you personally. We use this information to deliver our Web pages to
            you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users
            and to measure traffic within our sites.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Information Sharing and Sites Beyond Costamar.com<br>
            To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some
            features in conjunction with other providers made available through
            cooperative arrangements that specialize in operating such services
            and that will receive the information you provide when you register
            for, and use, these services. To take advantage of these services,
            you may need to provide personal information to us and to the other
            provider. And, of course, our sites include links to plenty of other
            Web sites whose privacy policies we don't control. Once you leave
            our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the
            location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is
            governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're
            visiting. And when you provide information in the course of
            obtaining products or services through our site, use of any
            information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the
            provider of those products or services, even if it appears that
            you're on Discovery-branded pages throughout the transaction. That
            policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of
            any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should
            contact the site directly for more information.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Encryption and Security<br>
            All information gathered on any Costamar.com Web site is encrypted
            for storage within a Costamar.com -controlled database. Costamar.com
            seeks to safeguard the information you provide. As effective as
            encryption technology is, however, no security system is completely
            impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our
            database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be
            intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Costamar Travel<br>
            We are committed to safeguarding the information you submit to us
            when you make travel reservations and purchase travel services
            through Costamar Travel. We will not share any of the personally
            identifiable information (such as your name, address or telephone
            number) that you provide when you request information about a trip,
            make a reservation or purchase travel services through Costamar
            Travel, except to the related company (for example, an airline, tour
            operator or hotel) providing such services.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            A Final Note: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change
            our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the
            changes here. Of course, our use of information gathered while the
            current policy is in effect will always be consistent with the
            current policy, even if we change that policy later. If you have any
            questions about our privacy policy, please send an email to
            privacypolicy@Costamar.com. Thanks for using the Costamar.com Web
            site!</font></p>
