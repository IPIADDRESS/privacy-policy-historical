            <p>We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights, or protect the rights, property, and other interests of our users or others.
            </p>
            <p>In the event Cosplay.com becomes part of another organization either through acquisition, sale of assets or merger, your user information and all personally identifying information may be transferred the successor entity, and your information would remain subject to the pre-existing privacy policy.
            </p>

We do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to register for an account.
            </p>
            <p>We strongly advise minors 13 years of age or older to ask their parents for permission before posting any information about themselves anywhere on the internet.

            </p>
            <p>Revisions to the privacy policy become effective the date they are posted.  Your continued use of this website constitutes an acceptance of the updated privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, your only remedy is to remove your account from our website.
