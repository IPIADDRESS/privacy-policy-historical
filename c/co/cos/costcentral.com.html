						<h1>Customer Care - Privacy Policy</h1>
                        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
                        <div class="outline2">
                        	<p>Erie Computer Company is the sole owner of the information collected on www.costcentral.com.  Costcentral.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>

                        	<h3>Registration</h3>
                        	<p>In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.</p>

                        	<h3>Order</h3>
                        	<p>We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.</p>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h2>Information Use</h2>
                        <div class="outline2">
                        	<p>Costcentral.com is a computer and computer peripheral dealer. We operate this website, costcentral.com, which collects personal information and credit card information for the sole purpose of processing orders, and providing accurate shipping. Your information would only be shared with companies that help us process your order, deliver your order or provide the services that we offer customers. Our customer database is stored in an SQL database on a UNIX server, the security of which is taken very seriously. Our administrators are constantly monitoring the servers for new weaknesses to maintain the highest levels of security. Rest assured that your identity and banking information are safe at Costcentral.com</p>

                        	<h3>Profile</h3>
                        	<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.  We do not share your profile with other third parties</p>

                        	<h3>Cookies</h3>
                        	<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  We use session ID cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.</p>  
                        	<p>By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, to purchase items using our shopping cart, you must accept session cookies.</p>

                        	<h3>Log Files</h3>
                        	<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>  

                        	<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>
                        	<h4>Special Offers and Updates</h4>
                        	<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.  Click <a href="https://www.costcentral.com/account-newsletters.php" title="opt-out">here</a> to opt-out.</p>

                        	<h4>Newsletter</h4>
                        	<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.  Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.  Click <a href="https://www.costcentral.com/account-newsletters.php" title="opt-out">here</a> to opt-out.</p>
                        
                        	<h4>Service Announcements</h4>
                        	<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p> 
                        
                        	<h4>Customer Service</h4>
                        	<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>
                        
                        	<h3>Sharing</h3>
                        	<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
                        	<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
                        
                        	<h4>Third Party Advertisers</h4>
                        	<p>Your information would only be shared with companies that help us process your order, deliver your order or provide the services that we offer customers. We do not share your information to third parties for advertising.</p> 
                        
                        	<h4>Third Party Intermediaries</h4>
                        	<p>We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
                        
                        	<h4>Business Transitions</h4>
                        	<p>In the event Costcentral.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  Users will be notified via email, and a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information may be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
                        
                        	<h3>Links</h3>
                        	<p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Costcentral.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
                        
                        	<h3>Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
                        	<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p> 
                        
                        	<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
                        	<p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  Costcentral.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  Costcentral.com does not store this information.  The friend does not need to contact us to request the removal, as this is not a recurring mailing list.</p>

                        <h2>Security</h2>
                        <div class="outline2">
                        	<p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
                        	<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.</p>
                        	<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every two months, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</p> 
                        	<p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@costcentral.com">webmaster@costcentral.com</a></p>

                        <div class="outline2">
                        	<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the our website or by emailing our Customer Support at customerservice@costcentral.com.  Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>

                        <div class="outline2">
                        	<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>  
                        	<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
