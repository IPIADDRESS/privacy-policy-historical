<p>Costa used to be part of the Whitbread group of companies. It has now separated, but for a limited period, Whitbread Group PLC will provide certain transitional services to Costa. Costa Limited shares data with Whitbread Group PLC when they provide us with IT and infrastructure services and security services, including CCTV.</p>
<p>For some activities Costa uses third party service providers, for instance O2 provide WiFi in our stores. When these service providers need customer data from you, we share information with them, such as whether a correct Costa Coffee Club member number has been entered to access WiFi, or our online order fulfilment partner needs information such as your name, contact details, address, and the items you have purchased to manage any complaints, comments or queries you submit to us regarding your online purchase.<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to using Whitbread Group PLC as described above, we use third party providers for the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi (O2)</li>
<li>Sending promotional offers</li>
<li>Customer feedback surveys</li>
<li>Online order fulfilment, including the management of queries, concerns or complaints related to your order(s)<br>
</li>
<li>Data analysis to enable us to optimise our services (including locations and products) Gift cards (including E-Gifts)<br>
</li>
<li>Loyalty scheme platform</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>IT development, support, maintenance and hosting, including the provision of applications and website hosting</li>
<li>Payments’ processing to enable you to pay by credit or debit card</li>
<li>CCTV system provision and maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>If our business is to be integrated with another business or sold, your details would be shared with our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers. Your information could be passed to the new owners. (You will be notified if this happens).</p>
<p>Personal data may be shared with government authorities and/or law enforcement officials for the prevention or detection of crime, if required by law or if required for a legal or contractual claim.</p>

<p>Sometimes we send or store your data outside of the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) (‘EEA’). For example, to follow your instructions, comply with a legal duty or to work with or receive services from our service providers who we use to help run your accounts and our services.</p>
<p>If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected by using one of these safeguards:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. Some countries have been deemed adequate by the EU.</li>
<li>Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA or use other mechanisms and measures to achieve adequate protection. We also may use the Standard Contractual Clauses published by the EU.</li>
<li>Transfer it to organisations that are part of Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA.</li>
<li>Binding corporate rules. These are internal rules adopted by group companies to allow international transfers of personal data to entities within the same corporate group located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our service provider in the US, who helps us with our customer feedback surveys, we rely on Privacy Shield. For our service provider in India, who has restricted access to some data to provide us with IT support and maintenance services, we rely on contractual measures. For further details on the mechanisms used please contact <a href="mailto:costadataprotectionofficer@whitbread.com" title="Click here to get in touch with us regarding your data">costadataprotectionofficer@whitbread.com</a>.</p>
