        Costco Wholesale Corporation<br>
        Privacy Statement</h1>
    <h2 id="PrivacySubTitle">
        (Australia)<br>
        Last Updated October 2010
    </h2>
    <p>
        This privacy statement (also referred to as Costco's Privacy Policy) explains our
        privacy practices for our members who: (1) shop in our Australian or international warehouses or
        (2) use our Australian Web site, <b>www.costco.com.au</b>. Costco may include Costco's affiliate
        companies.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Costco's Commitment to Privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
        We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the
        uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains our
        policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information.
        The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you, unless
        different terms are specified as part of a special offer, or in another form or
        contract we provide you and you consent to those terms by participating in the special
        offer or the program, or otherwise. The paragraphs below provide detailed information
        about our privacy practices:
    </p>
    <h2>
        What is Personal Information?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual
        or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's
        name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, debit card number, or information
        about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her
        purchases. Personal information also includes information such as your medical history.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a convenience to our members we allow the primary cardholder to nominate his/her
        spouse or others to membership.
    </p>
    <p>
        In all circumstances, other than your choice to opt out (see Choice below), reference
        in this policy statement to "you" or "your" also includes your spouse and the others
        added onto your membership by you. Reference in this statement to "information you
        provide" includes information provided by you, your spouse or others added on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information.
        Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products,
        services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.
        In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined
        with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information
        will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products
        you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased
        by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that
        we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and
        services to customer desires.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Collection of Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        We collect the personal information that you provide us, such as when you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>sign up for or renew your Costco membership; </li>
        <li>purchase products or services at our warehouse locations; </li>
        <li>contact us for any reason, such as by replying to enquiries by mail or fax, by telephone
            through customer service or in person at one of our locations; </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Use of Personal Information by Costco
    </h2>
    <p>
        The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests or
        transactions at any Costco, in Australia or abroad, provide you with high-quality
        service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest (including by
        direct marketing), and understand your needs so that we can serve you better.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address
        to : (1) alert you about product recalls or safety issues; or (2) communicate membership
        opportunities and programs. We also may use personal information we collect to provide
        you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value
        to your membership, such as coupon savings booklets, promotions, or information
        about Member Services ("Promotional Information"). If you prefer not to receive
        Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can
        contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sharing of Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, share or disclose personal information to third parties without
        your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described below:
    </p>
    <h3>
        Order Fulfilment
    </h3>
    <p>
        We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfil
        an order you have placed with us. For example, if you pay by a debit card, your
        card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor
        and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services).
        However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution
        chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order,
        such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product
        orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to
        use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information
        you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with
        their practices before disclosing information directly to them
    </p>
    <h3>
        Other Disclosures
    </h3>
    <p>
        In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that
        we are lawfully authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to
        comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the
        rights, property or personal safety of Costco Wholesale, our customers, our employees
        or the public. Information about our customers, including personal information,
        may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger,
        sale of company assets or acquisition
    </p>
    <h2>
        Protection of Personal Information
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information
        from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information
        we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information.
        We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort
        to protect against unauthorised access.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Choice
    </h2>
    <p>
        We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain information or to request
        that certain information not be shared with third parties by giving you numerous
        methods to inform us of your decision. Your choice to opt-out will not apply to
        your spouse or any other individual, including other family members.
    </p>
