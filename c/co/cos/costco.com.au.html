	<h2>
		A. What is Personal Information?
	</h2>
    <p>
        Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual or a reasonably
        identifiable individual.  In this connection “opinion” means information not of a strictly formal
        nature that we may collect in connection with your membership—for example, records of your
        membership-related inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
       Sensitive information is a subset of personal information, and includes information about your
        health. The Privacy Act imposes special obligations on the collection, use and disclosure of
        sensitive information.
   </p>
	<a name="COLLECTIONOFPERSONALINFORMATION"></a>
    <h2>
		B. Collection of Personal Information
	</h2>
    <h3>
        Type of personal information
    </h3>
	<p>
        The personal information we collect and hold is what is reasonably necessary for our business
        functions and activities. The personal information we collect may include:
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>contact information - name, address, telephone number and email address; </li>
		<li>gender; </li>
		<li>date of birth; </li>
        <li>your organisation details; </li>
        <li>member identification information, enquiry details, communications, and interactions with us; </li>
        <li>Internet (IP) address; </li>
        <li>information about purchases and online shopping; and</li>
        <li>information about your health (for example, through our hearing aid or optical centers).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
        How personal information is collected
	</h3>
	<p>
        We collect personal information that <b>you</b> provide us directly, including when you:
	</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sign up for or renew your Costco membership including online;</li>
        <li>sign up for news or notifications of specials or other promotions on costco.com.au; </li>
        <li>purchase products or services;</li>
        <li>contact us for any reason;</li>
        <li>participate in a survey or promotion;</li>
        <li>sign up for or participate in our various Member Services (see <a href="#MEMBERSERVICES">Member Services</a> below);. </li>
    </ul>
	<p>
        We may automatically collect some information when you visit our <b>website</b>, such as your
        computer's IP address and operating system details, the site from which you linked to us, your
        site activity, the time and date of your visit, and any purchases. This information may be
        collected through the use of "cookies" and web beacons (see <a href="#ONLINESPECIFICS">Online Specifics</a> below). 
	</p>
    <p>
        We also obtain information from third parties including those who help us correct our records,
        prevent fraud, and provide Member Services or special promotions or products (see <a href="#MEMBERSERVICES">Member
        Services</a> below). We may combine any of this information with the other personal information
        we maintain about you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where you provide us with personal information about someone else you must have their
        consent to provide their personal information to us based on this privacy policy. 
    </p>
    <h3>Collection of sensitive information</h3>
    <p>
        We will not collect sensitive information about you unless you consent (we take your provision of
        the information to be consent to its collection), and the information is reasonably necessary for
        one or more of our functions or activities. If we collect any sensitive personal information about
        you, that information will only be used and disclosed by us for the purpose that it was provided
        by you. 
    </p>
	<a name="USEOFPERSONALINFORMATIONBYCOSTCO"></a>
	<h2>
        C. Use of Personal Information by Costco
	</h2>
	<p>
        The personal information we collect is generally used to:
	</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sell and promote our goods and services to you;</li>
        <li>process your requests, transactions, complaints or enquiries;</li>
        <li>provide you with high-quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest; and </li>
        <li>administer your account, including distribution of our own surveys and publications. For example, we may:
        <ul>
         <!--   <li><li>alert you about product recalls or safety issues;</li> -->
            <li>alert you about product recalls or safety issues</li>
            <li>communicate membership opportunities and programs; and </li>
            <li>provide you with promotional information, such as coupons, offers and product
                  recommendations, or information about Member Services ("Promotional Information").
                  If you prefer not to receive Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for
                  you to let us know. You may contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information
                 (see <a href="#CHOICE">Choice</a> below); and</li>
            <li>deal with you in relation to the purchase of goods and services or other business transactions.</li>
          </ul>
		</li>
     </ul>
    <p>
        We may not be able to do these things without your personal information. For example, we may
        not be able to provide you with our services or communicate with you.
    </p>
	<a name="SHARINGOFPERSONALINFORMATION"></a>
    <h2>
        D. Sharing of Personal Information
	</h2>
	<a name="GENERAL"></a>
	 <h3>1. General</h3>
	    <p>We may share your personal information for the purpose for which it was collected.</p>
        <p>We may share your personal information with: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>related entities;</li>
        <li>external service providers such as IT providers (on a confidential basis and such service
         providers will be limited in their use of your information to the purpose of the relevant
         company’s activities only); and</li>
        <li>specialist advisers to Costco</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act, we may also share it for another purpose
     if you would reasonably expect us to and the purpose is related to the purpose for which it was
     collected.</p>
	<a name="MEMBERSPERSONALINFORMATION"></a>
    <h3>2. Members’ personal information</h3>
       <p>We share personal information in these circumstances:</p>
    <ol type="a">
		<a name="ORDERFULFILLMENT"></a>
        <li><h4>Responding to Communications from You </h4></li>
        <p>
            We may provide your personal information to third parties, as necessary to fulfill a
         transaction or respond to a question or claim about products or services you have
         purchased from or are supplying to us.  However, we give third parties, and others
         involved in the distribution chain only the information useful or necessary to facilitate
         the transaction. We are not responsible for any information you provide directly to these
         parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing
         information directly to them.
         </p>
		
		<a name="MEMBERSERVICES"></a>
        <li><h4>Member Services </h4></li>
         <p>
             We may offer special products and services to our members through third parties, such as rebates,
         financial, travel, insurance and other business and consumer services ("Member Services"). 
         We may share your name, postal address, email address and membership status, number and type ("Member Information") 
         with these third parties in order to notify you of their offerings, to determine whether, or at what level, 
         you qualify for the products, offerings or services, and to evaluate new and existing products, offerings or services.
         If you prefer that we not share Member Information with third parties, you can contact us at any time (see <a href="#CHOICE">Choice</a> below). 
        </p>
        <p>
            These third parties are required by us to use personal information we share only to provide the requested services. 
           We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to
           become familiar with their privacy practices and policies before disclosing information to them.
           Information you provide to third parties, may in turn be shared with us along with information about your use of the services. 
           In some cases, these third parties may require as a condition of providing services to you that you authorize them to share information with us. 
           If we terminate our relationship with a third party, information you provided to them may be returned to us, 
           and we may provide that information to a new third party offering the same or similar services. 
        </p>
		<a name="OURCONTRACTORS"></a>
        <li><h4>Our Contractors</h4></li>
