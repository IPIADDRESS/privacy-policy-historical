<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div id="main-content" class="indent">
<p>HPCi Media Limited (“HPCi”) is committed to protecting your<br>
personal information when you are using our services. This Privacy Policy<br>
relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us through the<br>
hpcimedia.com websites.</p>

<ul class="text-list">
<li>what information HPCi may collect about you;</li>
<li>how HPCi will use information we collect about you; when HPCi Media may use your details to contact you;</li>
<li>whether HPCi will disclose your details to anyone else;</li>
<li>your choices regarding the personal information you have provided to us;</li>
<li>use of cookies on our websites and how you can reject these cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As set out above, we are committed to safeguarding your personal<br>
information. Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to<br>
use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal<br>
information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to<br>
collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws").</p>
<p>Our websites contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third<br>
parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including<br>
cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal<br>
information you submit or are collected by cookies whilst visiting these<br>
websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy<br>
practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your<br>
own risk.</p>
<h2>What information will HPCi collect about me?</h2>
<p>When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from any HPCi<br>
website, such as newsletters, we may ask for personal information about you. This can<br>
consist of information such as your name, email address, postal address,<br>
telephone or mobile number or date of birth. Different web pages may ask for<br>
different personal information. </p>
<p>By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable HPCi and<br>
its service providers to provide you with the services you select. </p>
<p>HPCi also uses cookies (see below for details) and use analysis software  for the purpose of enhancing your user<br>
experience..</p>
<h2>How will HPCi use the information they collect about me?</h2>
<p>HPCi  will use your personal information for a number of purposes<br>
including the following:</p>
<ul class="text-list">
<li>to deliver any products or services you have requested;</li>
<li>for "service administration purposes"   (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance);</li>
<li>to inform you of other relevant products and services that as far as HPCi determine match your industry and job function;</li>
<li>to contact you about a submission you have made to the websites, including any content you provide;</li>
<li>to personalise the way content is presented to you;</li>
<li>to analyse and improve the services offered on hpcimedia.com. e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When will HPCi contact me?</h2>
<p>HPCi may contact you:</p>
<ul class="text-list">
<li>in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed up for in order</li>
<li>to ensure that HPCi Media can deliver the services to you;</li>
<li>in relation to any contribution you have made to hpcimedia.com, e.g. on HPCi Media message boards;</li>
<li>to invite you to participate in surveys about HPCi Media services (participation is always voluntary); and</li>
<li>for marketing purposes where legislation permits this and you have not told us that you do not wish to be contacted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Will HPCi Media share my personal information with anyone else?</h2>
<p>We will keep and use your information in line with best practice and our<br>
legal obligations under the current UK data protection and privacy legislation.</p>
<h2>Offensive or inappropriate content on HPCi Media website</h2>
<p>If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content<br>
anywhere on or to hpcimedia.com, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour<br>
on hpcimedia.com, HPCi Media may use your personal information to stop such<br>
behaviour.</p>
<p>Where HPCi Media reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any<br>
of the laws of England or Wales (e.g. because content you have posted may be<br>
defamatory), HPCi Media may use your personal information to inform relevant<br>
third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider or law<br>
enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
<h2>How long will HPCi Media keep my personal information? </h2>
<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is<br>
necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant<br>
contract you hold with HPCi Media or HPCi Media's corporate retention schedule<br>
(this is a database that defines which documents should be kept and for how<br>
long). In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a hpcimedia.com<br>
member, once an account is deleted a red flag goes on the database and, while<br>
people cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period<br>
of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.</p>
<p>Where you contribute to hpcimedia.com we will generally only keep your<br>
content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it<br>
was submitted. For example, HPCi Media will only keep copies of entries to a<br>
photographic competition for the duration of the competition. However other<br>
projects (e.g. the People's War website) are likely to have a longer, or even<br>
permanent, duration. </p>
<h2>Can I find out what personal information HPCi Media holds about me?</h2>
<p>Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the<br>
personal information HPCi Media holds about you and to have any inaccuracies<br>
corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests and will require you to prove<br>
your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.) We will<br>
use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about<br>
you on our files.</p>
<p>Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about<br>
this Privacy Policy to the Data Protection Officer, HPCi Media, Paulton House, 8<br>
Shepherdess Walk, London N1 7LB. </p>
<h2>What if I am accessing HPCi Media websites outside the UK?</h2>
<p>www.hpcimedia.com is published in the UK by HPCi Media. For international<br>
users accessing the site from outside the UK all personal information submitted<br>
by you to the site goes directly to HPCi Media and will be processed in<br>
accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check<br>
it each time you submit personal information to any hpcimedia.com website. The<br>
date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page.</p>
<h2>Cookies Policy </h2>
<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier<br>
that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device")<br>
browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive.<br>
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's<br>
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a<br>
website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent<br>
to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website<br>
in order to track online traffic flows.</p>
<p>Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to<br>
tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their<br>
devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to<br>
receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised<br>
services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be<br>
able to take full advantage of all of the hpcimedia.com features. Each browser<br>
is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change<br>
your cookie preferences.</p>
<p>During the course of any visit to hpcimedia.com, the pages you see, along<br>
with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because<br>
cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the<br>
device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a<br>
repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last<br>
visit.</p>
<h3>How does HPCi Media use cookies?</h3>
<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our<br>
visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. This can be<br>
achieved through personalisation of your web pages or analysing user activity to<br>
determine what is more popular and what is not.</p>
