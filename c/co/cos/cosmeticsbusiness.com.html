<h1>HPCi Media Limited Website personal data “Privacy Policy”</h1>
<p>HPCi Media Limited (“HPCi Media”) is committed to protecting your 
personal information when you are using our services. This Privacy Policy 
relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us through the 
 websites owned by HPCi Media ("the Websites").</p>
<p>This privacy policy explains the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what information HPCi Media may collect about you;</li>
  <li>how HPCi Media will use information we collect about you; when HPCi Media may use your details to contact you;</li>
  <li>whether HPCi Media will disclose your details to anyone else;</li>
  <li>your choices regarding the personal information you have provided to us;</li>
  <li>use of cookies on our websites and how you can reject these cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>As set out above, HPCi Media is committed to safeguarding your personal 
information. Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to 
use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal 
information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to 
collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws").
</p><p>Our websites contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third 
parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including 
cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal 
information you submit or are collected by cookies whilst visiting these 
websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy 
practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your 
own risk.</p>
<h2>What Information about me will HPCi Media collect?</h2>
<p>When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from any HPCi 
website - such as subscriptions, newsletters, competitions, message boards -
 we may ask for personal information about you. This can 
consist of information such as your name, e mail address, business address, 
telephone or mobile number. Different web pages may ask for 
different personal information.  Where you are asked to submit details of your
credit card HPCi confirms that it will not retain any of these details and they 
will be used solely for processing the transaction.</p>
<p>HPCi Media also uses cookies (see below for details) and collects IP 
addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific 
computer or other network device on the internet). We use analysis software to 
look at IP addresses and cookies for the purpose of enhancing your user 
experience. This information is not used to develop a personal profile of you 
and the log files are regularly purged.</p>
<h2>How will HPCi Media use the information they collect about me?</h2>
<p>HPCi Media will use your personal information for a number of purposes 
including the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to deliver any products or services you have requested;</li>
  <li>for "service administration purposes", which means that HPCi Media may contact you for reasons related to the service you have signed up for, as set out below (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance);</li>
  <li>to inform you of other relevant products and services that as far as HPCi determine match your industry and job function;</li>
  <li>to contact you about a submission you have made to the websites, including any content you provide;</li>
  <li>to personalise the way HPCi content is presented to you;</li>
  <li>IP addresses are used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from different countries and also to block disruptive use; and</li>
  <li>to analyse and improve the services offered on the Websites. e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where HPCi Media proposes using your personal information for any other uses 
we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity 
to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.
</p>
<h2>When will HPCi Media contact me?</h2>
<p>HPCi Media may contact you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed up for in order to ensure that HPCi Media can deliver the services to you;</li>
  <li>where you have opted to receive further correspondence;</li>
  <li>in relation to any contribution you have made to hpcimedia.com, e.g. on HPCi Media message boards;</li>
  <li>to invite you to participate in surveys about HPCi Media services (participation is always voluntary); and</li>
  <li>for marketing purposes where legislation permits this and you have not told us that you do not wish to be contacted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Will HPCi Media share my personal information with anyone else?</h2>
<p>We will keep and use your information in line with best practice and our 
legal obligations under the current UK data protection and privacy legislation.</p>
<h2>Offensive or inappropriate content on the Websites</h2>
<p>If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content 
anywhere on the Websites, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour 
on the Websites, HPCi Media may use your personal information to stop such 
behaviour.</p>
<p>Where HPCi Media reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any 
of the laws of England or Wales (e.g. because content you have posted may be 
defamatory), HPCi Media may use your personal information to inform relevant 
third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider or law 
enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
<h2>How long will HPCi Media keep my personal information? </h2>
<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is 
necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant 
contract you hold with HPCi Media. </p><p>
</p><p>Where you contribute to our Websites we will generally only keep your 
content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it 
was submitted. </p>
<h2>Can I find out what personal information HPCi Media holds about me?</h2>
<p>Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the 
personal information HPCi Media holds about you and to have any inaccuracies 
corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests and will require you to prove 
your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.) We will 
use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about 
you on our files.</p>
<p>Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about 
this Privacy Policy to the Data Protection Officer, HPCi Media, Unit 1, Vogans Mill Wharf, Mill Street, London, SE1 2BZ. </p>
<h2>What if I am accessing the Websites outside the UK?</h2>
<p>The Websites are published in the UK by HPCi Media. For international 
users accessing the site from outside the UK all personal information submitted 
by you to the site goes directly to HPCi Media and will be processed in 
accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time and
date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page.</p>
<h2>Cookies Policy </h2>
<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier 
that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device";) 
browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. 
Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's 
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a 
website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent 
to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website 
in order to track online traffic flows.</p>
<p>Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to 
tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their 
devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to 
receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised 
services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be 
able to take full advantage of all of the hpcimedia.com features. Each browser 
is different, so check the help menu of your browser to learn how to change 
your cookie preferences.</p>
<p>During the course of any visit to hpcimedia.com, the pages you see, along 
with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because 
cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the 
device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a 
repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last 
visit.</p>
<h3>How does HPCi Media use cookies?</h3>
<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our 
visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. This can be 
achieved through personalisation of your web pages or analysing user activity to 
determine what is more popular and what is not.</p><br>
