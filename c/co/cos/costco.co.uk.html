      <h3>Costco Wholesale UK Limited Privacy Statement<br>
(United Kingdom) Last updated 25th May 2012 </h3>

<h4>
This privacy statement (also referred to as Costco's Privacy Policy) explains our privacy practices for our <br>
 UK members, and UK foreign members who:<br>
(1) shop in our United Kingdom warehouses or<br>

(2) use our United Kingdom Web site, <a href="http://www.costco.co.uk">www.costco.co.uk</a></h4>

<h4>Costco's Commitment to Privacy<br></h4>
<p>
We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you, unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer, or in another form or contract we provide you and you consent to those terms by participating in the special offer or the program, or otherwise. The links below provide detailed information about our privacy practices:</p>

<h4>What is Personal Information?</h4>
<p>
Personal information is information that identifies an individual or is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a member's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, debit/credit card number, photograph, or information about activities which can be directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal information also includes information such as your medical history. As a convenience to our members, we allow the primary cardholder to add his/her spouse or others to membership. In all circumstances, other than your choice to opt-out (see Choice below), reference in this policy statement to "you" or "your" also includes your spouse and the others added-on to your membership by you. Reference in this statement to "personal information" includes information provided by you, your spouse or others added-on. Please note that we may provide information about purchases made by additional cardholders to the primary cardholder.

</p>
<p>
Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires.
</p>

<h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
<p>
We collect the personal information that you provide us, such as when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>sign up for or renew your Costco membership;</li>
<li>purchase products or services at our warehouse locations;</li>

<li>contact us for any reason, such as by replying to enquiries by mail or fax, by telephone through customer service or in person at one of our locations;</li></ul>

<h4>Use of Personal Information by Costco</h4>
<p>
The personal information we collect is generally used to process your requests or transactions, provide you with high-quality service, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest, and understand your needs so that we can serve you better. For example, we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address to : (1) alert you about product recalls or safety issues; or (2) communicate membership opportunities and programmes. We also may use personal information we collect to provide you with promotional information, which is information we believe will add value to your membership, such as coupon savings booklets, promotions, or information about Member Services ("Promotional Information"). If you prefer not to receive Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).
</p>
<p>
The provision of certain Costco services (such as our healthcare facilities) may involve the processing of sensitive personal information, and may be subject to additional privacy terms and the giving of any necessary consent.
</p>

<h4>Sharing of Personal Information</h4>
<p>

We do not sell, rent, share or disclose personal information to third parties without your prior consent, except to the primary cardholder as described above or in the limited circumstances described below:
</p>

<h4>Order Fulfillment</h4>
<p>
We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfill an order you have placed with us. For example, if you pay by a debit/credit card, your card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services). However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order, such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.
</p>

<h4>Other Disclosures</h4>
<p>
We may provide to a third party the personal information necessary to allow them to offer or provide any benefits to which you are entitled under the terms of your Costco membership.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorised to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Costco Wholesale UK Limited, our members, our employees or the public. Information about our members, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition. Finally, we may transfer personal information to affiliated companies of Costco Wholesale UK Limited operating in countries outside the European Economic Area, subject to appropriate protections.
</p>

<h4>Protection of Personal Information</h4>
<p>
We have put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorised access.
</p>
<h4>Choice</h4>
<p>
We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain information or to request that certain information not be shared with third parties by giving you numerous methods to inform us of your decision. Your choice to opt-out will not apply to your spouse and any add-on members.
