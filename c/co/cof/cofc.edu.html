<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">This Policy and Procedure governs the security and confidentiality of personal information entrusted to the care of College of Charleston (“College”) to carry out its mission and to certain other sensitive information that is generated and owned by the College. This Policy and Procedure also establishes the principles and processes by which that information will be maintained and managed. </p>
<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">The <i>South Carolina Family Privacy Protection Act</i> provides, in relevant part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">§ 30-2-20. Privacy policies and procedures required of all state entities.</p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">All state agencies, boards, commissions, institutions, departments, and other state entities, by whatever name known, must develop privacy policies and procedures to ensure that the collection of personal information pertaining to citizens of the State is limited to such personal information required by any such agency, board, commission, institution, department, or other state entity and necessary to fulfill a legitimate public purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">Implementation and adherence to this Policy and Procedure are necessary to comply with the cited statute and to provide for the protection of sensitive information that is maintained or owned by the College. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">The specific purposes of this Policy and Procedure are: </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li style="text-align: justify;">To establish a College-wide approach to information security. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To prescribe mechanisms that help identify and prevent the compromise of information security and the misuse of data, applications, networks and computer systems. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To define mechanisms to protect the reputation of the College and allow the College to satisfy its legal and ethical responsibilities to others. </li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To prescribe an effective mechanism for responding to external complaints and queries about real or perceived non-compliance with this Policy and Procedure.<a name="cc"></a></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To further reduce the risk of exposure and identity theft when a Social Security Number or other personal identifying information is used by the College as a primary identifier and to provide for the consistent, proper and secure management of such information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SCOPE</h3>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">This Policy and Procedure is applicable to all members of the College Community including our faculty, staff, students, visitors and contractors who have access to College records regardless of the medium in which those records are stored or where they are located.</p>
<h3>SOUTH CAROLINA FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT<a name="_ftnref1"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></sup></h3>
<p>
            State law requires the College to develop privacy policies and procedures to ensure that the collection of personal information pertaining to citizens of the State is limited to such personal information as may be required by the College to fulfill its public purpose.<a name="_ftnref2"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">The College is also required, as a state entity, to clearly display its Privacy Policy on its web page, along with the name and telephone number of the College’s designee who is “responsible for administration of the policy.”<a name="_ftnref3"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></sup> This Policy and Procedure will be included, therefore, on the College’s web site.</p>

<h3>7.0 DISPOSAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES CONTAINING PROTECTED INFORMATION<a name="_ftnref18"></a><sup><a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a></sup></h3>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>7.1 Hardware and Storage Media.</b> Before a College Unit may transfer or dispose of information technology hardware or storage media, all Protected Information must be removed and the hardware and storage media must be sanitized in accordance with the standards and policies adopted by the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”). The CIO shall verify that all Protected Information is removed and the information technology hardware and storage media are sanitized in accordance with those standards and policies before the transfer or disposal occurs.</p>
<p><b>7.2 Records.</b> When a College Unit disposes of a record that contains Protected Information the Unit shall modify, by shredding, erasing, or other means, the Protected Information to make it unreadable or undecipherable.     The College Unit is considered to comply with this requirement if it uses a College retained contractor who is engaged by the College and who is in the business of disposing of such records. </p>
<h3>8.0 ETHICS</h3>
<p><b> 8.1 Self Dealing.</b> An employee of the College may not use or disclose Protected Information gained in the course of or by reason of that person’s official responsibilities in a way that would affect an economic interest held by that person, a member of that person’s immediate family, or an individual or business with whom that person is associated.<br>

<h3> 9.0 RESPONSIBILITIES </h3>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>9.1 Passwords</b>. Passwords help protect against misuse of data systems and networks by restricting the use of those systems and networks to authorized users. Each authorized user of such a system may be assigned or may be asked to develop a unique password that is to be protected by that individual and not shared with others, is difficult to determine, is changed on a regular basis, and is deleted when no longer authorized. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>9.2 Security</b>. Individual users are responsible for ensuring that others do not use their system privileges. In particular, users must take great care in protecting their usernames and passwords from eavesdropping, loss or careless misplacement. Passwords are never to be 'loaned.'   Individual users will be held responsible for any security violations associated with their username or passwords. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>9.3 Access Policies of Data Systems</b>. Each user permitted to access a system containing Protected Information shall be made aware of the access policy for that system. Management will provide this information to the employee when first granting access and make the employee aware of the auditing capability in place to verify compliance. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>9.4 Collection of Protected Information</b>.

Information Technology operations staff are responsible for reviewing the logs and identifying potential security violations. The IT operations staff is responsible for establishing the security and access control mechanisms (such as usernames, passwords, logging protocols) and may be held accountable for any security breaches that arise from improper configuration of these mechanisms.   If the application is housed outside of IT, the application administrator must be in a position to fulfill these requirements and document the same in writing.</p>

<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>10.1 Generally.</b> Protected Information that resides on a College user's computer or a portable computer or portable storage device must be secure at all times.     The theft or loss of a portable computer or portable storage device must not put Protected Information at risk of unauthorized disclosure.     In addition, Protected Information shall not be maintained at all, if to do so would violate the College’s records retention policy dealing with the length of time such records should be maintained (see <a href="http://recordsretention.cofc.edu/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://recordsretention.cofc.edu/</span></a>).</p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>10.2 Consultation with IT</b>. Members of the College community who have a legitimate business or educational need to take Protected Information off campus in the form of a portable electronic device shall consult with the College Chief Information Officer or his/her designee for the nature and type of protection that shall be afforded such Information.</p>

All such actions must be reviewed and pre-approved by the Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs who shall consult with the President or the appropriate Executive Vice President, as the circumstances may warrant.</p>
<h3>12.0 INTERNET AND EMAIL ACCESS</h3>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>12.1 Vulnerability of Systems; Transmissions</b>.Protected Information shall not be saved on any computer directly accessible from the Internet or from “open” portions of the College’s internal network unless a user is first duly authorized to access such open portions.   Users should clearly understand that many common systems, such as normal email, cannot be considered a secure way to transport confidential information.   If it is necessary to transmit Protected Information electronically to a point external to the College, prior consultation should take place with the Office of the CIO.</p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>12.2 Web Based Surveys and Other Data Collection Tools</b>.Data collection tools, such as web based surveys that request Confidential Information, must ensure that responses cannot be accessed by unauthorized persons and that Personal Information is not improperly disclosed or shared. If a College vendor is involved in conducting the survey or analyzing results that include Confidential Information that can be linked to individuals, a contract must be in place that protects the Protected Information.</p>

The Security Breach shall be assigned a preliminary level of severity appropriate to the potential of the Breach to result in identity theft, invasions of privacy, and/or economic or other harm to the College.   The CIO shall consult with the Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs and privacy Committee regarding all such matters. </p>
<h3>14.0 COMPLIANCE</h3>

Other persons who may violate this Policy and Procedure, such as a College vendor, may be barred from College property and any further business dealings with the College, as well as, appropriate legal action.   The College reserves the right to require anyone having access to Protected Information to first execute a confidentiality agreement approved by the Office of Legal Affairs as a condition for having access to such Information. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b>14.2 Responsible Office</b>.The Office of the CIO shall be responsible for monitoring compliance with this Policy and Procedure and for reporting violations to the appropriate Executive Vice President and to the Office of the Legal Affairs.

<p style="  text-align: center;"><b>APPENDIX C</b></p>
<p style="  text-align: center;"><b>APPROVED USES OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION </b></p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">The primary approved uses and the reasons for collecting and maintaining Social Security Numbers (“SSNs”) and other Personal Information by of for the College of Charleston include, but are not limited to, the following: </p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enrollmen</span></b>t: </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">Those wishing to enroll in academic offerings at the College, both credit and non-credit, may be required to provide a SSN to determine lawful presence in the United States.     With respect to student employment, IRS regulations require the College to request a SSN as a Taxpayer ID number for use in tax reporting. In addition, any student applying for financial aid may be required to provide a SSN to the College.   Historic records may retain a student’s SSN if, for example, the SSN was previously used as the primary identifier for the person who is the subject of that record.   However, to the extent practicable, the release of such a record to other than the subject should be preceded by an inquiry with the subject if he/she would prefer if the College redact the SSN from the record. </p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Employment</span></b>: </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;">A SSN must be provided on Form I-9   (Employment Eligibility Verification) in accordance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). SSN’s may also be collected to verify lawful presence in the United States through E-Verify and other acceptable verification sources. Finalist for employment may also be requested to provide a SSN pursuant to the College’s Background Checks Policy. All persons employed by the College must also provide a SSN as the taxpayer ID number. Providing a valid SSN is a condition of employment. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Employee Benefits</span></b>: If required by law or a benefits provider, the SSNs of the employee and the employee’s dependents/beneficiaries may be collected and provided to the service provider. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Payment for Personal or Professional Services</span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">; Other Disbursements</span></b>: Any person providing services to the College as a contractor, invited speaker or research subject for which payment will be made, may be required to provide a SSN as the taxpayer ID number. These taxpayer ID numbers may be stored in the accounting system as part of the vendor record. In addition, certain other disbursements from the College may require reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. In such an event, these disbursements may be preceded by a request for the SSN or other taxpayer ID number.</p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Planned Giving Donors</span></b>: Donors to the College participating in planned giving programs must provide a SSN as the taxpayer ID.</p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insurance Providers</span></b>: SSNs continue to be the patient identifier for many health care providers. To enable payment of medical bills, and to the extent allowed by law, the SSN of the patient may be shared with the insurance company providing health coverage. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third</span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-</span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Party Sponsors</span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of Student Aid</span></b>: Various third-party sponsors of student aid, including several state agencies, require the submission of SSNs for those students for which aid is being provided. In order for the sponsor to make payment to the College, a SSN may be requested for proper verification. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit Card Information</span></b>: When the College has been paid by credit or debit card, or a declining balance card, the College may maintain the card numbers and related information for a period of time, in accordance with its records retention policy, after the transaction has occurred. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Student Health Services</span></b>: SSN’s or other personal identifying information may be used, as appropriate, as a patient identifier for referrals and consultation with outside medical providers and for communication with insurance companies. </p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Safety</span></b>: Law enforcement personnel may collect or use SSN data to serve a subpoena, conduct an investigation, to make a report, or to make an arrest, as permitted by applicable provisions of state and federal law, rules or regulations. Additionally, Campus Police maintain copies of fingerprint cards for Public Safety employees and others that may contain SSN data and other Personal Information.</p>
<p style="  text-align: justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Otherwise Required By Law</span></b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span></b> As determined by the Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs, Personal Information shall be collected, used and maintained as directed by court order, subpoena or other compulsory legal process, or as otherwise required to protect the legal interests of the College and the College community.</p>
