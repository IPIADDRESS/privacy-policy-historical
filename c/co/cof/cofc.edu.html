        REQUIRED BY S.C. CODE ANN. ยง30-2-40 </p>
      <p align="left" class="text">It is the policy of the College of Charleston to protect personal information to the fullest extent consistent with laws of South Carolina and of the United States. The College will only collect personal information if it is necessary to fulfill a legitimate public purpose, such as considering an admissions application for student enrollment or processing an application for employment with the College. We shall keep that information for only as long as the state law on records retention and our College policy may permit.</p>
      <p align="left" class="text">The College is a state-assisted institution of higher education. We are subject, therefore, to the provisions of the South Carolina Freedom of information Act (S.C. Code Ann. 30-4-10 et seq.). Consequently, all of our public records are also subject to this Act; however, the College will not release your personal information unless you give your permission, or we are required to release that information under law, or it is necessary that we release the information to accommodate a request you have made, or it is otherwise considered necessary by us to carry out a legitimate public purpose. To the extent that the College does use your personal information, you will be provided all prior notices as are required under law.</p>
