<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<h2>Last Revised January 4, 2012</h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting this web site. We understand the importance that Internet users place on
privacy, and this Privacy Policy describes how we use personal information that is collected at
this web site. Please read this Privacy Policy before using this site or submitting any personal
information. By using this web site, you accept the privacy practices contained in this Privacy
Policy. These privacy practices may change from time to time, but any changes will be posted.
You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the web site to make sure
you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like names,
	addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information when such
	information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We may use your personal information,
	transfer your personal information, and/or sell your personal information for any legal purpose,
	including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the products and/or services to you that you have
	requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms and conditions; (3) for content
	improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of
	the web site or product(s); and (5) to bring retail opportunities and promotional offers to you by
	email, direct mail, telemarketing, and/or online banner advertising. When your information is
	provided to third parties, these third parties may include providers of direct marketing services
	and applications. We or these third parties may supplement the information we collect online
	with outside records to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and/or to
	offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products and services that we
	believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>We will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties unless you have given us
	explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted
	from us. By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive free information
	on products and services that may be of interest to you. You also enable us to personalize your
	experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service. By submitting
	your email address on this web site, you agree to receive email from us and our third party
	advertisers. We, and our third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for different
	purposes. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the
	opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send
	emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party.
	We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.</p>

<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your email address on this web site and/or registering
	to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry,
	and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16
	CFR '310 et seq. and any applicable state and local "do not call" regulations. We and our third
	party advertisers retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR
	and the applicable state regulations.</p>

<h2>Third Party Actions</h2>

<p>We do not control and are not liable for the actions of our third party marketers or advertisers.
	We pride ourselves in working with quality companies, but have no control over the actions
	of those third parties. While we are not liable for any of the actions of those third parties, you
	should feel free to give us feedback from time to time on your experiences with any third parties
	to whom we work with so that we may enhance our future service to all customers.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
We may use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your interests. Cookies are text files that
are used by your computer's web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance
your user experience with our web site.

<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
<p>We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose problems with our server, to
	gather broad demographic information, and to offer you products and services.</p>

<h2>Third Party Web Sites</h2>
<p>This web site and/or the products and/or services offered herein may direct you to web sites that
	are owned and/or controlled by third parties. We have no control over those third parties and are
	not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of those sites or companies.</p>

<h2>Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p>All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.
	We use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, and we do everything we can
	to protect user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet can be
	guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures to protect your
	information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information that you transmit to us,
	and you do so at your own risk.</p>
