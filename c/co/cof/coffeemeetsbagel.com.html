<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>With whom we share your information</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Personal information.</span></strong><span> We <strong>do NOT</strong> share ANY personally identifiable information with others except as indicated below or when we request and you explicitly consent of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Aggregated and non-personal information.</span></strong><span> We may share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources for our blog. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>How we collect and use information</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>1. <u>Log Files.</u> Any time you visit any of our websites, our servers automatically gather information from your browser (such as your IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. For example, we may log your IP address for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not share the log files externally. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>2. <u>Cookies.</u> We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our website or using our services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our website; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly. Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality. We do not link the cookies to any PII.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>3. <u>Web Beacons.</u> “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our website for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our visitors. We may also use web beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our customers. We do not link the web beacons to any PII.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>4. <u>Information About You.</u> When you register or subscribe to our service, we collect a wide variety of information about you, such as names, email address, phone number and your zipcode. Your non-personal identifiable information about yourself (such as schools, occupation, home country etc.) will be used to build your "My Profile." Except as otherwise stated in this privacy statement, we do not disclose your PII to your matches or other users of our services.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>5. <u>E-mails and Telephone Calls.</u> We require an e-mail address from you when you register for our services. We use your e-mail for both transactional (e.g., confirming your registration, notifying of matches) and promotional (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special third-party offers) purposes. E-mail messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Coffee Meets Bagel services, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. We also contact you by text message (to a wireless number you provide to us) solely in connection with Coffee Meets Bagel services. We fully comply with the requirements of the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>6. <u>Demographic Data.</u> Demographic data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitors’ experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>7. <u>Online Survey Data.</u> We may periodically conduct voluntary member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in such surveys because they provide us with important information regarding the improvement of our services. You may also volunteer for certain surveys that we may offer to our users, and any additional rules regarding the conduct of such surveys will be disclosed to you prior to your participation. We do not link the survey responses to any PII, and all responses are anonymous. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>8. <u>Information Regarding Your Friends.</u> We encourage you to refer a friend to our service by sending us a friend’s email address. We will keep this information in our database, and send that person a one-time e-mail containing your name and inviting them to visit our site. This e-mail will also include instructions on how to unsubscribe from our email list. You agree that you will not abuse this feature by entering addresses of those who would not be interested in our services. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>9. <u>Use for Research.</u> In addition to the uses outlined above, by using our site, you agree to allow us to anonymously use the information from you and your experiences to continue our research into successful relationships. This research may be published in our blogs or interviews. However, all of your responses will be kept anonymous, and no PII will be published. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Third-party websites</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>There may be places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.

We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. </span></p>

If you delete or disable your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>Security</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We have extensive security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information stored in our database. These measures include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL), as well as other proprietary security measures which are applied to all repositories and transfers of user information. We will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, but given that no information transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and hence accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.</span></p>

We do not target our sites or services to minors under the age of 18, and in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we may receive from users we believe to be under the age of 13 will be purged from our database.</span></p>
