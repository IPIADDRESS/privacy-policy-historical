    </h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Notice applies to information that we collect from or about our consumers
        through the methods described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Notice does NOT apply to information collected by our affiliate companies,

        Please note we may combine information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website)
        with information that we collect via another method (e.g., an offline event). We
        do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us

        <a name="WhatCollect"></a>2. What information do we collect, including how do we respond to Do Not Track signals?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Depending on how you interact with Nestlé USA (online, offline, over the phone,
        etc.), we may collect from you various types of information (personal and aggregate),
        as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal information (as used in this Privacy Notice) refers to such types of information
        that can be used to personally identify you, whereas aggregate information does
        not allow for such identification.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine/link one type
        of information with another type of information (e.g., personal contact information
        with account login and/or demographic information), and store them together in our
        records. We strive to limit the amount of information we collect and store to that
        which is reasonably necessary to provide you the relevant services. We generally
        store your information for as long as your account is active with us or as needed
        to provide you the relevant services. We may store your information for a longer
        period of time to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes,
        enforce our agreements, or for records management purposes.

        about someone else (for example, if you provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend

        advertising purposes. We partner with a third party ad network to either display
        advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network
        partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information
        about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising
        based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the

        You will continue to receive generic ads. You can control tracking tools. In particular,
        your browser gives you the ability to delete or reject browser cookies. If you block
        cookies, certain features on our website may not work. Some browsers have a “Do
        Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your
        online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so note that our
        systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers.
        If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in
        this Privacy Notice will stop.

        if you choose to receive SMS text messages, your plan fees for messaging will apply.
        We may also show you marketing communications on other websites, including on social
        media sites where you are a member, by matching activities or information collected
        on our websites with those collected on third party sites (“Targeted Advertising”).These
        marketing communications will keep you up-to-date on the latest news, events, special
        offers, and promotions from the Nestlé USA brands of interest to you. On occasion,
        these communications may also introduce you to other Nestlé brands and inform you
        about offers and promotions from other third party companies. Sending you marketing
        communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain <a href="#PersonalContact">
            personal contact information
        </a> and <a href="#Demographic">demographic information</a>.
        In some instances (such as for mobile apps and text messaging programs), this could
        involve the use of your precise geo-location, which may allow us to send you location-based
        offers and promotions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can always opt-out from receiving marketing-related email communications or
        text messages by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communication.
        If you have an account with us, you may be given the option to change your communication
        preferences under the relevant edit-account section of our site (if available) or
        by contacting <a href="#ContactInfo">Consumer Services</a>. Changing these preferences
        would also remove you from our lists for future Targeted Advertising. You may also
        visit social media sites where you are a member to explore opt out options they
        may provide for Targeted Advertising. Please note that even if you opt out from
        receiving marketing communications from us, you may still receive administrative
        communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about your account
        activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, etc.), and other important
        announcements. You will also still see generic ads on other websites, including
        on social media sites where you are a member.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third
        party company, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing
        communications directly from that third party, you will need to contact the third
        party (not Nestlé USA) to opt-out from such communications. This process may be
        outlined in the third party’s privacy policy.

        <a name="protectperinfo"></a>4. How do we protect your personal information?
    </h2>
    <p>
        We use a variety of standard methods (described below) to help keep consumer information
        confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply
        to information you choose to share in public areas such as our <a href="#WebsiteCommunity">
            website community features
        </a> or other social areas.

            <span style="text-decoration:underline">Secure operating environments</span>
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        We store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from
        the public and that we only allow authorized Nestlé USA employees and agents/contractors
        to access on a need-to-know basis. We follow generally accepted industry standards
        to protect personal information; however, no method of transmission over the Internet,
        or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee
        its absolute security.

            <span style="text-decoration:underline">Encryption for payment info</span>
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        We use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive
        financial information, such as credit card information, sent to us over the web.
        For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online stores.
        Please note, however, that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell
        Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé USA. Because these
        sites may have different practices than we do, we recommend that you read their
        privacy policies before making any purchases.

    <p>
        We require our registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g., login ID/email
        address, password) before they can access or make changes to their account information.
        This helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.

    <p>
        It is important for you to also play a role in keeping your information safe and
        secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account
        password that is hard for others to guess and never reveal your password to anyone
        else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID/email
        address or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time
        you leave the computer. You should also make use of any privacy settings or controls
        we may provide you in our website community areas.

        We may share your personal information with our subsidiary companies, companies

        website or application with another company, organization, or other reputable third
        party; and, as part of this event, collect and process personal information. If
        your personal information is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other
        than Nestlé USA as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time
        your personal information is collected. Periodically, we may run a promotion on
        our website or application that features the products or services of another company
        and will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive information directly from
        that third party company. When doing any promotion involving another company, we
        may provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you
        to read it before you share any personal information, as we cannot guarantee they
        adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your information to be
        collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not
        to opt in or participate in these events at the time the personal information is

    <p>
        Nestlé USA and our partners make use of tracking technologies such as
        (“Cookies”, "Log Files”, “Web Beacons” and similar technologies)
        to gather certain information such as browser type and operating
        system, referring page, path through site, domain of ISP etc. for the purpose of
        improving the use and functionality of our websites and other purposes described
        below. Tracking technologies help us tailor our websites to your personal needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Cookies</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        We use Cookies to improve the use and functionality of our websites and to better
        understand how visitors use our websites and the tools and services offered on it
        and to communicate elsewhere on the web. The storage of Cookies on your computer
        provides an easy and convenient way for us to personalize or enhance your experience

    </p>
    <p>
        We may keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to (among other things): (i)
        troubleshoot technical concerns, (ii) maintain website safety and security, (iii)
        restrict access to our websites to certain users, and, (iv) better understand how
        our websites are utilized. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on
        the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Log Files</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        We (or a third party on our behalf) may collect information in the form of logs
        files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing
        habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help us gather (among other
        things) (i) a user’s browser type and operating system, (ii) information about a
        user’s session (such as the URL they came from, the date and time they visited our
        website, and which pages they've viewed on our website and for how long), and, (iii)
        other similar navigational or click-stream data. We also use information captured
        in log file for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly
        improve and customize the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally
        only, and are not associated with any particular user.

    <p>
        We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our websites or include them in the e-mail
        messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are small strings of
        code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an
        email message for the purpose of transferring data back to us. The information collected
        via web beacons may include some of the information described in the IP Address
        section directly above, as well as information about how a user responds to an email
        campaign (e.g., the time the email is opened, where does the user link to from the
        email, etc.). We use web beacon information for a variety of purposes, including
        but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and
        email auditing and reporting, and personalization.

        We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children below

        information from a child below 13, we will remove that child’s information from
        our records as soon as feasibly possible. However, we may collect personal information
        about children below the age of 13 for marketing purposes from the parent or legal
        guardian directly. For non-marketing (e.g., educational) purposes, we may only collect
        personal information from a child below the age of 13 with the explicit prior written
