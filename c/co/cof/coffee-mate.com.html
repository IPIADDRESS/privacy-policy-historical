														<span class="articletextclose"><b>Welcome. Thank you for visiting Coffee-mate.com, a Nestle USA web site. This privacy 
policy tells you how Nestlé uses personal information collected at this 
site. Please read this privacy policy before using this web site or submitting 
any personal information. By using this site, you are accepting the practices 
described in this privacy policy. We may, infrequently, change these practices, 
but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information 
on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the privacy 
policy whenever you visit to make sure that you understand how any personal information 
you provide will be used.</b><br><br>

<span class="articletextheader"><b>What We Collect and How We Use It</b></span><br>
Coffee-mate.com will occasionally request information from visitors to provide 
them special offers and features. In these instances, we collect personally identifiable 
information, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc. It is only collected 
when voluntarily submitted by visitors and it only used to fulfill the specific 
offer or request. For example, to receive email updates or newsletters about a 
Nestlé web site, our products and promotions; to send you samples, if offered 
and requested; to respond to your question or issue in the Contact Us (email) 
section; and to enter a specific sweepstakes or other online promotion or offer. 
This information is only used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give 
us permission to use it in another manner, for example, to receive future information 
from us.<br><br>

If you have elected to receive future information from us, you will receive 
  information from the site or Nestle brand that you elected to hear from. You 
  may receive information by regular mail or email, depending on the information 
  you provided. From time to time, we may feature products/services from other 
  reputable organizations, companies or brands that may interest you. Your personally 
  identifiable information is not shared with these other companies. All mailings 
  come from the Nestle site or brand that you elected to hear from.<br><br>

To make the registration process easier, we have created a "one time" 
  registration tool that is used across many of Nestle's web sites. This means 
  that if you have registered at one Nestlé site, the information you provided 
  can be automatically made available to you for registering at another Nestle 
  site. Don't worry, all your information is password protected and you must still 
  opt in to receiving information from a Nestle site or a brand before you are 
  added to its mailing list.<br><br>
We do not share your personally identifiable information collected at this 
  site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below, The exceptions 
  are:<br>
· We may share your information with our partner agencies who assist 
  us in administering the site and various programs and promotions. They can only 
  use the information to administer our site and programs. These agencies are 
  bound to keep your information private and secure.<br>
  · From time to time we may run a joint promotion on this site with another 
  company or organization. You will always be advised if another company is also 
  collecting information and you can access that company's privacy policy. <br>
  · We may also disclose personal information if required by law, for example, 
  to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms and Conditions, 
  or site or game rules; or to protect the safety and security of site visitors.<br><br>

We may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records to enhance 
  our consumer profiles for our own marketing purposes.<br><br>

<span class="articletextheader"><b>Referrals</b></span><br>
If you send a friend an email from a site referring the friend to the site, 
  the "referral" information you provide is used on a one-time basis 
  to facilitate the communication and is not further retained by Nestlé.<br><br>

<span class="articletextheader"><b>Demographic Information and Surveys</b></span><br>
We may ask for demographic or profile (age, gender, interests, etc.) information 
  in a survey or at registration. This information is used to assist us in tailoring 
  the site and our products to visitors and consumers. We may share aggregated 
  demographic and survey information with third parties, but we do not share individual 
  information.<br><br>
