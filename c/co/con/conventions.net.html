					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent"><strong> What Else Should I Know About My Privacy When Online? </strong></p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">The Conventions.net website contains many hyperlinks to other websites. The Conventions.net website also contains advertisements of third parties. Conventions.net is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites or advertisers. Conventions.net does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Conventions.net with the websites to which Conventions.net links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Conventions.net may share aggregate data with such websites (such as how many people use our Site). </p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">Please check with those third party sites to determine their privacy policy. When Conventions.net embeds third party content into one of its Conventions.net web pages, Conventions.net will use reasonable efforts to advise our users that they have exited a Conventions.net operated website and are entering a third party controlled website. Customers/users should read and understand any privacy policy noted on all third party websites.</p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through email, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. </p>

					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent"><strong> Your California Privacy Rights </strong></p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">Under a provision of California law, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (" California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. </p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">Because this Site is intended for use on a business-to-business basis, this provision of California law will not apply, in most cases, to the information collected.</p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">To the extent a California resident using this Site for personal, family, or household purposes seeks information covered the law, this Site qualifies for the alternative option. As stated in our Privacy Policy, users of the Site may opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information during the preceding year for marketing purposes. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on the Site. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent"> California residents who utilize this Site for personal, family, or household purposes may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="/mailto:sales@conventions.net" target="_blank">sales@conventions.net</a>. You should put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent"><strong> Your Consent To This Policy </strong></p>
					  
					  <p align="left" class="bodyContent">By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of information by Conventions.net as specified in this policy. Please also note that your use of the website is governed by the Conventions.net Terms and Conditions.
