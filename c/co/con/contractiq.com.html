	<h4>
		Your privacy, and the privacy of all registered users of web sites that are part of the ContractIQ service, is important to us. Accordingly, we have
		adopted the following privacy policy. Our policy is based on the principles of notice, choice, access and security in the collection and use of all
		information regarding our users and their activities at our site.
	</h4>
	<h4><span class="resources_title">1. Notice</span><br>
		This policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you, how we may use or disclose that information and our efforts to protect
		it. Please read this policy carefully, and feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ContractIQ.com">info@ContractIQ.com</a> if you have any
		questions regarding its contents.
	</h4>
	
	<div class="privacy_nested">
		<h4>Types of Information Collected</h4>
			In connection with your use of our site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about you in different ways. For example, when
			you register to use our site, we ask for and store your and/or your business' name, address, email address and other identifying contact data. In
			addition, our web servers automatically collect the IP addresses from which you accessed the site. We may also collect the information you disclose in
			any of our scorecards, IQ Profile, CustomerIQ, chat rooms, discussion groups, and bulletin boards.
		
		<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
			Use of our site requires that you accept the use of cookies, which are small data files that our Web site sends to your browser for storage on your
			computer's hard drive. We use cookies to protect confidential data, track activity at our site and better serve your needs and interests.
	
		<h4>Use of Information</h4>
			We use your personally identifying information to identify you as a user of the site, to improve your service and to improve your experience with the
			site. We may use your email address to contact you directly regarding services or products that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also
			associate your personally identifying information with information we collect about your preferences and activities at the site, such as the particular
			pages you request at the site and purchases or other transactions you effect through the site. We may vary the content you receive in future visits to
			the site based on your preferences and activities.
			<br><br>
			We may combine your personally identifying information, and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group
			of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities. For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages
			or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through our site in a particular geographic region. Such information, and
			other information we derive from individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality fellow users through more
			accurate marketing and advertising of our Web site.
			<br><br>
			For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Privacy Policy shall limit the right in Submissions that you provide to ContractIQ, as "Submissions" and
			rights therein are defined in the <a href="/TOS">Web Site Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.
	
		<h4>Disclosure of Information</h4>
			We may provide your personally identifying information, and information about your activities and preferences, to other companies wishing to contact
			you about products or services, but only to those that we believe impose reasonable safeguards on the privacy of your information. We may also provide
			these companies with collective profiles of our user groups and their activities and preferences. Such collective profiles may also be disclosed in
			describing our site and services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
			<br><br>		
			Finally, we may disclose information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is
			legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm.
	</div>
	<br>
	<h4><span class="resources_title">2. Choice</span><br>
		You may choose to restrict our use of your information to maintaining your account on the site, or prohibit our disclosure of your information to
		others, by contacting us and directing us to impose such limits. If you do not wish us to provide your information to third parties, or otherwise wish
		us to restrict the use or disclosure of your information, please send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@ContractIQ.com">info@ContractIQ.com</a>.
		<br><br>
		In addition, we will not send unsolicited messages to users of our site who indicate that they do not wish to receive such messages. If you do not wish
		to receive unsolicited email messages from us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ContractIQ.com">info@ContractIQ.com</a>.
	</h4>		
	
	<h4><span class="resources_title">3. Access</span><br>
		At any time after you have logged on to our site, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ContractIQ.com">info@ContractIQ.com</a> to request access
		to information we have collected regarding you or your business or to notify us of changes to such information. If you request any such changes, we
		will contact you by email or fax to confirm those changes. Once confirmed, any new item of information will replace the corresponding information
		previously provided.
	</h4>	
	
	<h4><span class="resources_title">4. Security</span><br>
		We use industry-standard encryption methods to transmit your personal registration information from your computer to ours across the Internet, and we
		restrict access to any transactional portions of our site to computers running web browsers that support Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. To use
		this protection technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher, Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or
		higher. These browsers will automatically activate the technology when you log on to our site.
		<br><br>
		Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well. Your password to access our site, which you select at registration, should never be
		shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. And, after you have finished using our site, you should log off and exit your browser so no
		unauthorized persons can use our site with your name and account information. Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line in any
		news or message postings, scorecards, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you
		provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or
		disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.
		<br><br>
		Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
		information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
	</h4>
	
	<h4><span class="resources_title">Changes to Privacy Policy.</span><br>
		It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in
		privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting the revised
		policy on this web site. This policy was posted on December 29, 2011. Data will be handled in accordance with the policy in effect at the time the data
		is used, subject to the user's right to opt out of revisions to this policy implemented since the data was first collected.
