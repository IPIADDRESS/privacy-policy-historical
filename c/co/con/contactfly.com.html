used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your
unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously
acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Company to
track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online
behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you
may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company
also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Company’s

information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information
to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to
better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information
may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or
not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your
computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol
("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to
you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network
("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently
assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web
servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP
address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation
of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP
address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or
which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses,
and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

experience of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data
relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system
