      <p>Protecting your privacy is our highest priority. Consumer Input is designed
        to be an anonymous research forum. As such, we go to great lengths to
        ensure that your anonymity will remain intact. Our data collection techniques
        have been designed to purge personally identifiable information from our
        databases.</p>
      <p>Your email address will be used to contact you if you've won a prize
        or to alert you to additional research opportunities. We will never sell
        your email address to a third party, nor will we ever solicit you for
        sales purposes of any kind.</p>
      <p>Other than your email address, we will not collect information that can
        be tied to you as an individual. In fact, we will only require your name
        if you are selected as a winner in one of our cash drawings.</p>
      <p>We will not license, publish, or sell any information collected from
        our panelists that can be tied to an individual user. Nor will we use
        such information as part of a targeted marketing program. We offer our
        clients aggregate data concerning online consumer behavior by collecting
        information from the panel and, also, by licensing URL and demographic
        data (age, gender, household income, geographical location, etc.) from
        sources such as ISPs and browser companions. We honor the privacy of our
        panelists and the privacy policies of our licensors and do not knowingly
        collect or license personally identifiable information from our panelists
        or licensors.</p>
      <p>Inadvertently, the URL information we collect and license sometimes contains
        personal information about Internet users. Potentially, a name, address,
        email address, or similar information that an Internet user enters into
        a Web page can become part of the URL that is transmitted to us and stored
        in our databases. While we have no control over what information third
        party websites put into their URLs or where they put it, we make every
        commercially viable effort to purge our databases of any personally identifiable
        information. The data collection software uses a proprietary rules engine
        to search through all URLs, before transmitting them to its database,
        to strip out any such personally identifiable information. We do not disclose
        the contents of individual URLs stored in our databases so we will not
        release or use this information. Further, we aggregate data on hundreds
        of thousands of users before supplying data to our clients, thereby ensuring
        that an individual's privacy remains intact at all times.</p>
