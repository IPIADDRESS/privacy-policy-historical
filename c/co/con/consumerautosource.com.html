<h3>Privacy Policy:</h3>
<p>At ConsumerAutoSource.com, your privacy is a top priority, and we are committed to protecting your privacy both on ConsumerAutoSource.com and online. This Privacy Policy provides details on how we treat any personal information you may submit to us.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to this website, ConsumerAutoSource.com (the â€œSiteâ€). Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the information collected through the Site and not to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.</p>
<h4>Information We Collect and Use</h4>
<p>We will collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for products and services offered through the Site. Specifically, we collect information provided by you in connection with obtaining quotes for insurance products and services. For example, you will be asked to provide your full name, address, telephone number, email, information about your automobile(s), and other information in order to be matched to insurance carriers and agents who may provide you a quote for their insurance services based upon the profile of information you provide.</p>
<p>We also collect demographic information. Demographic information is all other information such as gender, zip code, or any information that is not tied to your personal information. In addition, we might receive information about you from other online or offline sources and may add that information to your existing account.</p>
<h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
<p>We share personal information about you under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>Insurance Quote Request - If you submit a request on the Site for quotes for insurance products or services, we will share the personal information contained in your request form (such as your full name, address, telephone number, email, information about your cars, etc.) with third parties, which include insurance agents, insurance carriers, lead aggregators, and other insurance service providers (â€œService Providersâ€) in our network to process and fulfill your request for insurance quotes. In some circumstances, we may obtain additional information about you and/or share that information with Service Providers in our network.</p>
<p>All Service Providers in our network have entered into agreements with us, and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations. By submitting your request to us, you understand that Service Providers may contact you by telephone (on a recorded line), automated calling, email, or regular mail based on the information you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of the Service Providers contacts you and you wish not to be contacted again by that Service Provider with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that Service Provider not to contact you again. Please note that the Service Providers may maintain the information you provided whether you elect to use their services.</p>
<p>Aggregate, Non-Personal, or De-identified Information. We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect with third parties, including affiliates to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Site and on the websites of third parties.</p>
<p>As Required by Law. We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>Business Transfer. As with any other business, it is possible that we, in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including your personal information, customer and business account information, but would continue to be bound by this policy unless you consent otherwise.</p>
<h4>Cookies and IP Addresses</h4>
<p>To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used the Site. Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. We also may use cookies to deliver targeted advertising on our website, websites owned by our sister companies, or websites of third parties.</p>
<p>We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
<h4>Clear Gifs</h4>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
