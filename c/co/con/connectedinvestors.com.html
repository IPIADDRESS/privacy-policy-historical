or “our”) collects through <b><u></u></b><a href="http://my.connectedinvestors.com/">http://my.connectedinvestors.com</a>
(the “Site”) the Ci mobile app (the “Application”), </p>

<p>(the
“Application”, and collectively with the Site, the “Services”), and how we
collect, use, and share that information.&nbsp;
This Privacy Statement does not govern our collection of personal
information through any website or other means, other than through the Services.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By
using the Services, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification,
our practices surrounding the collection, use, and sharing of personal
information provided by you in the manner described in this Privacy
Statement.&nbsp; If you do not agree with the
terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not access, browse, or use the Services.</p>

This information may include:</p>

up for the Services, you are required to provide information such as your name,

with profile information, such as your picture, personal bio, interests, posts

information obtained from location-enabled devices (including through GPS,

provide you with the most relevant data and search information for the

information from your mobile device even when you are not actively using the

you exit the Application without using “force quit”).&nbsp; You can disable location services through your
mobile device’s settings or the Application’s settings by turning off the location information.<b>&nbsp; <i><u>Once you manually disable location information, reopening the
Application may automatically reset the settings to allow the transmission of
location information (even if you do not manually adjust the settings)</u></i></b>.
