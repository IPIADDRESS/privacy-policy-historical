  <p><b>Effective as of
  September 23, 2016</b></p><p>This Privacy Policy
  applies only to collection and use of Personal Information (defined
  below) and other information gathered on certain websites that are
  owned and/or operated by, or by authorized third parties on behalf
  of, Bang Bang LLC.<b> </b>(collectively, “<b>Bang Bang</b>”).
  This Site is a commercial website and is intended for use by our
  customers, prospective customers, vendors, and their respective
  employees and agents to obtain information about Bang Bang’s
  products and services.
  </p><p>If you have arrived at
  this Privacy Policy by “clicking” on an authorized link directing
  you to a Bang Bang-operated Site, then this Privacy Policy applies to
  such Site.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website owned
  and/or operated by or on behalf of any third party, even if we
  provide a link to such website on one of our Sites.  Capitalized
  terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings given
    such terms in our <a href="../terms">Website Terms of Use</a>.</p><p>When we refer to “<b>Bang
  Bang</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” “<b>us</b>” or “<b>our</b>,” we
  mean Bang Bang LLC. or the specific division, subsidiary or affiliate
  that operates this Site, provides its content or processes
  information received through it, each as appropriate and applicable.</p><p>When we refer to “<b>you</b>”
  or “<b>your</b>,” we mean the person accessing this Site.  If the
  person accessing this Site acts on behalf of, or for the purposes of,
  another person, including a business or other organization, “<b>you</b>”
  or “<b>your</b>” also means that other person, including a
  business organization.</p><p>We created this
  Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect Personal
  Information, what types of Personal Information we collect, how we
  use it, the steps we take to safeguard it, and the choices you have
  regarding how it may be used and disclosed.  This Privacy Policy
  addresses some types of information, including some Personal
  Information, the various means of collecting such information, and
  the possible uses of such information that may not presently apply to
  one or more of the Sites.  We are nevertheless advising you about
  these matters because we want to maintain flexibility in offering
  additional features without having to revisit this Privacy Policy
  every time we revise the Sites or offer new functions.  No
  description of any type of information, means of collecting
  information, including Personal Information, or use of such
  information will obligate us to collect any particular information,
  make any particular use of any such information, or offer any
  particular functionality.</p><p>By submitting your
  Personal Information through our Site, you will be considered to have
  given your permission and consent for the collection, use, retention
  and disclosure of your Personal Information as set forth in this
  Privacy Policy.</p><p>Use of our Site and
  Bang Bang’s services is strictly limited to persons who are of
  legal age in the jurisdictions in which they reside.  You must be at
  least eighteen (18) years of age to use our Site and Bang Bang’s
  services.</p><p>This Privacy Policy
  does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact
  between us and you.  This Privacy Policy does not cover information,
  including Personal Information, we collect by means other than the
  Sites.  If you have any questions about how we use information,
  including Personal Information, collected by means other than the
  Sites, you should inquire at or before the time you give such
  information to us.</p><p>Bang Bang reserves the
  right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to change, modify, add or
  remove any portion of the terms, in whole or in part, of this Privacy
  Policy at any time.  Please review this Privacy Policy periodically,
  as we may update it from time to time.  Each time you visit any of
  the Sites or provide us with information, including Personal
  Information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in
  this Privacy Policy as in effect at that time.
  </p><p>
  <u><b>I.The Types of Information We Collect</b></u></p><p>The web servers that
  serve the Site may gather certain navigational information about
  where visitors go on our Site and information about the technical
  efficiencies of our Site and services. In the process of gathering
  navigational information, anonymous information may be collected
  which will provide information regarding a visitor’s use of our
  Site.  Anonymous information means information that does not directly
  or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, a
  particular individual. Examples of anonymous information may include
  information about your Internet browser, domain type, usage
  statistics, service provider, and IP address information collected
  through tracking technologies (see “How We May&nbsp;Collect Your
  Information,” below, for additional information regarding our use
  of tracking technologies) and aggregated or de-identified data.
  </p><p>In order to operate
  the Site and provide you with information, products and services that
  may be requested by or are of interest to you, we may also collect
  and retain Personal Information.  “<b>Personal Information</b>”
  refers to information that identifies (whether directly or
  indirectly) a particular individual, such as information you provide
  on our forms, surveys, applications, user set-up and enrollment forms<b>
  </b>or similar online fields.  Examples of Personal Information may
  include your [name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number,
  Social Security number, date of birth or financial information (e.g.,
  passwords, bank and other financial institution account numbers and
  billing address) and demographic information (e.g., zip code,
  hometown, gender, financial transaction history information and age).</p><p>We may also collect
  location information, which means information that may be collected
  by certain mobile applications and that identifies your physical
  location. This information may be collected from your mobile device’s
  location-aware features when you request certain services that are
  dependent on your physical location.</p><p>
  II.<u><b>How We May&nbsp;Collect Your Information</b></u></p><p>
  <u><b>Information You Provide to Us</b></u></p><p>
  <span><span>We
  collect Personal Information from you or about you when you provide
  this information to us directly.  For example, we may obtain Personal
  Information when you request information, products or services from
  or otherwise interact with us or this Site.</span></span></p><p>
  <span><span>We
  may also gather such Personal Information through your access to your
  accounts online, as well as your asking questions through our
  “Contact Us” link, such as your name, address, e-mail address and
  other contact information.  We may also collect data resulting from
  your activity, such as transaction information.  </span></span>
  </p><p><u><b>Your
  IP Address</b></u></p><p>Like most websites,
  each time you visit any Site, we may automatically collect your IP
  address and the web page&nbsp;from which you came to our Site.  In
  order to administer and optimize the Sites for you and to diagnose
  potential issues with our Site, we may use your IP address to help
  identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.
  We may also supplement this information with Site traffic information
  that is collected automatically when you visit our Site, and with
  information acquired from our joint marketing partners, third parties
  and our affiliated companies.</p><p><u><b>Cookies
  </b></u>
  </p><p>We may use a browser
  feature known as a "cookie."  A cookie is a piece of data
  stored on the computer that runs an Internet browser and is commonly
  used to store information about a user’s online activities,
  including information such as the content or advertisements that a
  user views or the pages a user visits within a particular website.
  It can contain information about you, your computer, your browser,
  your session, the websites you visit and other information about you
  or others who use, or have used, the computer or browser you use to
  access the Internet.  Cookies are used for record-keeping purposes:
  the stored information can be retrieved by our website server when
  you return to the website.  This allows us to personalize or regulate
  the use of this Site, and it also permits us to automate the access
  and data entry functions of this Site (e.g., login information), and
  to tailor the appearance or presentation of this Site to your
  preferences or interests.  The cookies we use, if any, are not linked
  to any Personal Information while using this Site unless you have
  given us permission to link Personal Information to one or more
  cookies.  Please note that you give us that permission any time you
  register on this Site, use or conduct a transaction through this
  Site, or identify yourself or the computer you are using through this
  Site.
  </p><p>We use cookies as a
  convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our Site is
  used, and to improve the content and offerings on our Site.  For
  example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web
  pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g.,
  to recognize you by name when you return to our Site).  We may also
  use cookies to offer you or inform you of products, programs or
  services and targeted advertising.  You can opt to have your browser
  reject cookies.
  </p><p>Most or all browsers
  permit you to disable or reject cookies.  You can do this by
  adjusting your preferences in the browser.  Bang Bang does not track
  its customers over time and across third party websites to provide
  targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to “Do Not
  Track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the
  ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal
  Information about an individual consumer's online activities over
  time and across third-party Web sites or online services.
  Accordingly, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided
  by your browser may not have any effect on our analytics or tracking
  tools.  Use the “Help” feature of your browser to obtain more
  information about refusing cookies.  If you set the browser you use
  to reject cookies, you may not be able to access the Sites or use the
  full functionality of the Site, or it may take additional time to
  utilize such functionality.  If you opt to reject cookies, you may
  need to re-register with us every time you visit our Site.  Your
  continued use of our Site reflects your consent to allow additional
  cookies to be placed on your computer to help you navigate the Site.</p><p>You should also know
  that companies that advertise on our Site (and their agents), and one
  or more of the organizations with which we do business, or to which
  we provide links from the Site, might use their own cookies.  This
  Privacy Policy does not cover how these organizations use their
  cookies.  We have no control over such organizations’ uses of
  cookies, and you should review the privacy policies of such
  organizations to determine the uses such organizations make of
  cookies.
  </p><p><u><b>Flash
  Cookies</b></u></p><p>We may use local
  shared objects, sometimes known as Flash cookies, to store your
  preferences and to assist with online authentication by allowing us
  to recognize you and your device when you return to the Site.  This
  permits us to display content based upon what you view on our Site to
  personalize your use of our services.  Our Agents (defined below)
  also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash
  cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and
  type of data they collect, as well as how data is stored.  Cookie
  management tools provided by your device or browser will not remove
  Flash cookies.  If you disable Flash cookies, you will not have
  access to many features that make your user experience more
  efficient.</p><p><u><b>Pixel
  Tags, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</b></u></p><p>These are typically
  small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the Site, our
  applications or certain e-mail communications. They may involve the
  transmission of information directly to us, to another party on our
  behalf or to another party in accordance with its privacy policy. We
  may use these technologies to compile information we collect about
  you.
  </p><p><u><b>Clickstream
  Data</b></u></p><p>As you use the
  Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website
  you visit.  This information, which is sometimes referred to as
  “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s
  server.  Clickstream data can identify the type of computer and
  browsing software you use and the address of the website from which
  you linked to the Site.  We may use clickstream data as a form of
  non-Personal Information to anonymously determine how much time
  visitors spend on each page&nbsp;of the Site, how visitors navigate
  throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better
  meet the needs of visitors.</p><p><u><b>Log
  Files</b></u></p><p>We or our hosting
  provider may collect traffic information from visitors for
  statistical analysis and Site improvement.  When you access the
  Sites, we or our hosting provider may collect information about your
  visit in a log file on a server.  Log file information may include,
  but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
  type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform
  type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.  We or our hosting
  provider use this information to analyze trends, administer sites,
  track users’ movements in the aggregate, and gather demographic
  information for aggregate use.  We and/or our hosting provider may
  review this information to better understand overall trends and to
  determine what kinds of content are popular with and useful to users.</p><p><u><b>Spreadsheet
  Statistics</b></u></p><p>We may collect
  anonymous statistics from user spreadsheets at any time.  None of the
  statistics collected will contain any information on contacts that
  may populate the spreadsheet.  Such information will be strictly used
  to improve Bang Bang’s service offering and internal processes.
  </p><p><u><b>Location
  Tracking on Mobile Devices</b></u></p><p>Certain applications
  on mobile devices may transmit information to us about your location
  when you request information from them. We may use that information
  to improve the products and services we provide to you as well as to
  improve our services generally in your area.  You always have the
  ability to control what information your mobile device sends to us.
  You can exercise this control by changing the settings of your mobile
  device.</p><p><u><b>Information
  Other Websites Collect from You</b></u></p><p>Our Site may contain
  links to other websites operated by other parties whose practices may
  be different than ours.  When you click on such links and visit such
  other websites, you need to be aware that we may not control such
  other websites or such other websites’ business practices, and that
  this Privacy Policy does not apply to such other websites.
  Consequently, the operators of such other websites may collect
  different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose
  that information in different ways than we would if it were collected
  on the Site.  You should check the other sites’ privacy notices
  because we have no control over information that is submitted to or
  collected by them.  We encourage you to review other websites’
  privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for
  the actions of the operators of such websites, or their use of your
  information.</p><p>
  III.<u><b>How We Use Your Personal Information</b></u></p><p>We may use your
  Personal Information to help us improve our product and service
  offerings, improve the Site’s functionality process queries on the
  Site, to contact you when necessary in connection with products or
  services you accessed or inquired about via the Site, to provide you
  with account login credentials, and to send you information, offers
  and other promotional materials from us and selected third parties.
  </p><p><u><b>E-mail
  Address</b></u></p><p>We may use your e-mail
  address to provide customer service information or answer your
  questions and requests.  We may also occasionally send you our e-mail
  updates, notifications or other information about our products and
  services or about the products and services of our affiliated
  companies.  We may share your e-mail address with our affiliated
  companies to enable them to send you e&nbsp;mails directly regarding
  their products and services, sales and other promotions.  We include
  information in each commercial e&nbsp;mail that allows you to opt out
  of receiving future communications.
  </p><p><u><b>Financial
  Information</b></u></p><p>By engaging in any
  kind of activity on the Site that uses financial information, you
  consent to our using your financial information, including credit
  card information, or providing your financial information to our
  service providers and to such third parties as we determine is
  necessary, to process your transactions.  These third parties may
  include banking institutions used to process these transactions.  Any
  of these various third parties are authorized to use your financial
  information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such
  third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over
  which we have no control.
  </p><p><u><b>Demographic
  Information</b></u></p><p>We may use demographic
  information to tailor the Sites and communications to the interests
  of our users.  We may share anonymous, aggregated (grouped)
  demographic information with our advertisers and other third parties
  so that they can tailor their advertisements and communications to
  the appropriate audience.  If you consent to have us share, or we are
  otherwise allowed to share, your Personal Information, as described
  herein, then the demographic information that we provide to third
  parties may be linked to your Personal Information so that such third
  parties will be able to know about your demographic information on a
  non-anonymous basis.</p><p>
  <u><b>IV.Disclosure of Information</b></u></p><p>Except as described in
  this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your
  individual visits to our site, or Personal Information that you
  provide to any outside parties, except when we believe, in good
  faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i)&nbsp;comply
  with law, or (ii)&nbsp;protect the rights, property or safety of Bang
  Bang, our users or others.</p><p>We may also provide
  your Personal Information and other information that you have
  provided to us through the Site to other companies (“<b>Agents</b>”)
  that provide services to help us with our business activities such as
  to host or maintain our Site; for data processing services; to
  provide website or data security; to provide operational, analytical
  or reporting services; or to provide technical support.  In
  connection with providing those services to Bang Bang, an Agent may
  have access to your Personal Information.  Such Personal Information
  will be treated as private and confidential by such Agents and will
  not be used for any purpose other than as Bang Bang authorizes, and
  it will not be disclosed by the Agents to any third party.
  </p><p>Bang Bang may disclose
  your Personal Information when required by subpoena, court order or
  other legal process, or if it has a good-faith belief that disclosure
  is necessary to (a)&nbsp;comply with any applicable federal, state or
  local law or regulation, (b)&nbsp;assist government enforcement
  agencies, (c)&nbsp;investigate, prevent or take action in connection
  with suspected or actual illegal activities, (d)&nbsp;investigate
  suspected or actual violations of Bang Bang’s rights, (e)&nbsp;protect
  the rights, property or safety of Bang Bang and its customers or
  employees, or others, (f)&nbsp;investigate and defend against any
  third-party claims brought against Bang Bang or (g)&nbsp;protect the
  security and integrity of our Site.
  </p><p>We consider the
  information that you provide to us to be a business asset of ours.
  Accordingly, Bang Bang may also disclose Personal Information and
  other information to a third party in connection with the sale,
  assignment or transfer of some or all of the assets of Bang or as the
  result of a change in control of Bang Bang, in which case we will
  require any such third party to treat any such Personal Information
  in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Any such third party to whom
  Bang Bang sells, assigns or transfers Bang Bang’s assets will have
  the right to use the Personal Information and other information that
  you have provided to us.
  </p><p>Please note that no
  attorney/client relationship exists between us, and therefore no
  communication between us, or information you provide to us or input
  via use of a Site, will be subject to any confidentiality obligation
  or privilege against disclosure.</p><p>Bang Bang reserves the
  full and unrestricted right to use and disclose anonymized
  information; aggregated information or publicly available information
  that has not been combined with nonpublic Personal Information for
  purposes including, but not limited to, Bang Bang’s internal use
  and research.</p><p>
  <u><b>V.Authorized Third Parties</b></u></p><p>There are links on our
  Sites that direct users to third-party websites.  If you follow any
  such links and you enroll in the respective services, your name and
  other requested information will be transferred to the operators of
  the respective third-party website.  If you choose to use these
  third-party services, please review the third-party website’s terms
  of use and privacy policy prior to any transfer of your personal, or
  other, information.  Bang Bang is not affiliated with such
  third-party websites, and you therefore acknowledge and agree that
  your use of such third-party websites is at your own risk, and Bang
  Bang will not be responsible for the operation of such third-party
  websites or your access and use thereof.</p><p>We may also contract
  with some third parties to monitor certain pages of our website for
  the purpose of reporting website traffic, as well as to provide
  offers and advertisements that may be of interest to you.  Where
  authorized by us, these third parties may use cookies and/or other
  monitoring technologies to compile information about our website
  visitors.</p><p>
  <u><b>VI.Supplementation of Information</b></u></p><p>We may supplement the
  information we receive from you with other information we receive
  from third-party sources or clearinghouses.  Thus, information we
  obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in
  conjunction with information obtained through sources other than our
  Site, including both offline and online sources.</p><p>
  <u><b>VII.Information Ownership</b></u></p><p>We are the sole owner
  of the user information collected through the Sites.  We may collect
  information from users at several different points on the Sites.
  </p><p>
  <u><b>VIII.Account and Password Security</b></u></p><p>You may establish a
  unique user name and password ("<b>Credentials</b>") while
  completing a registration process for certain portions of the Site.
  It is your responsibility to safeguard and protect your Credentials
  and to monitor use of these Credentials for all purposes. You accept
  all responsibility for maintaining the security of your Credentials
  and for all utilization of the Site with your Credentials, with or
  without your knowledge or consent. You agree to (a)&nbsp;immediately
  notify Bang Bang of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or any
  other breach of security; (b)&nbsp;ensure that you log out and exit
  completely from your account at the end of each session; and
  (c)&nbsp;notify Bang Bang immediately if you have lost your
  Credentials or wish to terminate your access or have your Credentials
  changed.</p><p>
  <u><b>IX.Disclaimer</b></u></p><p><b>YOUR USE OF THIS
  SITE MAY BE FURTHER GOVERNED BY ANY OTHER AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO
  BETWEEN BANG BANG AND THE CUSTOMER (“CUSTOMER”) NAMED THEREIN
  (“CUSTOMER AGREEMENT”) GOVERNING CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNTS WITH BANG
  BANG.  NOTHING CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A DEFENSE TO,
  OR A WAIVER BY BANG BANG OF, ANY RIGHTS BANG BANG HAS UNDER THE
  CUSTOMER AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR APPLICABLE LAW, RULE,
  REGULATION OR REQUIREMENT.</b></p><p>
  <u><b>X.Our Security Precautions; Geographic Location of Information</b></u></p><p>Bang Bang will take
  reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information provided to us
  through the Site from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
  alteration and destruction.  Bang Bang has put in place reasonable
  and appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures
  designed to safeguard and secure such Personal Information from loss,
  misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
  Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
  enhanced as necessary.  While Bang Bang strives to undertake such
  reasonable and necessary efforts to secure Personal Information
  provided to us through the Site, even such security measures do not
  guarantee the security of all Personal Information, and Bang Bang
  cannot guarantee that the Personal Information it collects, uses and
  retains will be protected in all circumstances, including those
  beyond Bang Bang’s reasonable control.</p><p>Particularly sensitive
  information is encrypted.  You can usually tell whether encryption is
  being used by noting the “locked” or other status indicator on
  the browser you are using.  If the browser you are using does not
  indicate that the session is secure (e.g., by displaying a lock, a
  key or a similar icon), you should assume that the connection is not
  secure and that third parties will receive the information shared by
  you and us during that part of the session.  Your information may be
  transferred to and maintained on computer networks that may be
  located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental
  jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in
  which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws
  as protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction.</p><p>
  XI.<u><b>Notice Regarding Unauthorized Access or Disclosure of
  Personal Information</b></u></p><p>For the purposes of
  any applicable law regarding notification of persons whose Personal
  Information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by
  an unauthorized person, any required notification may, where
  permitted by law, be made by the use of e-mail, telephone, fax or
  mail (including a notice printed in an available area of a bill or
  statement) or by posting a notice on the Site.  The specific means
  used is up to us, and we will use our best judgment based on the
  circumstances.  Where any notice is to be sent to a specific address
  or number (such as an e-mail address, physical address, telephone
  number, etc.), we will use the latest available address in our
  records.  <b>YOU AGREE TO THIS MEANS OF NOTIFICATION.</b></p><p>
  <u><b>XII.Site and Service Updates</b></u></p><p>We may send to you
  updates and service announcements about our Sites, but you may not
  un-subscribe or opt not to receive such announcements because such
  announcements contain important information about the products and
  services offered through the relevant Site(s).
  </p><p>
  <u><b>XIII.Correcting or Updating Personal Information</b></u></p><p>If your Personal
  Information changes or if you have reason to believe that your
  Personal Information as we maintain it is incorrect and you are
  unable to change your Personal Information by logging into your
    account, you may contact us through our <a href="index.htm#contact">contact form</a>,&nbsp;and we shall
  attempt to accommodate all reasonable requests for such changes.
  Note that some information may be changed only by contacting the
  administrator of the Site.</p><p>
  XIV.<u><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></u><b>  </b>
  </p><p>We recommend that
  users who no longer wish to receive promotional materials or have
  their information provided to third parties log into their accounts
  and modify their account settings, as users may have chosen to
  receive promotional materials in the account registration process.
  If you are still receiving promotional materials 30 days after
  modifying your account settings, you may contact us directly using
  the information below to opt out of receiving such communications or
