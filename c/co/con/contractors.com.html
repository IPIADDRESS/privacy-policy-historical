    <h2>USER PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>Effective Date: July 6, 2016</p>
    <p>Contractors.com collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online
      products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications you have
      with us. The Services are provided by FoundersExclusive, LLC and its U.S. affiliates (collectively
      “Contractors.com.”), and this Privacy Statement applies to information collected and used by Contractors.com. </p>
    <p><strong>Scope and Application</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement") applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to
      request information and/or quotes for home improvement services (“Users”). This Statement does not apply to
      information we collect from or about contractors or home improvement professionals, or any other persons who use
      the Contractors.com platform under license (collectively “Contractors”). If you interact with the Services as both
      a User and a Contractor, the respective privacy statements apply to your different interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Collection of Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Information You Provide to Us</p>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request quotes
      or services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us or our Contractors. This information may
      include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, image uploads, payment method, work requested
      (for services), service notes, and other information you choose to provide.</p>
    <p>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text_m">When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li class="text_light"><strong>Location Information</strong>:&nbsp;When you use the Services for quotes on requested
      work, we collect precise location data for the location where work is to be performed. If you permit the
      Contractors.com app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system
      (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or
      background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
    </li>
    <li class="text_light"><strong>Contacts Information</strong>:&nbsp;If you permit the Contractors.com app to access
      the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and
      store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services
      and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.
    </li>
    <li class="text_light"><strong>Transaction Information</strong>:&nbsp;We collect transaction details related to your
      use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount
      charged, service requested, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses any promo code
      provided by you, we may associate your name with that person.
    </li>
    <li class="text_light"><strong>Usage and Preference Information</strong>:&nbsp;We collect information about how you
      and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this
      through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To
      learn more about these technologies, please see our&nbsp;<a class="linl_green" href="#">Cookie Statement</a>.
    </li>
    <li class="text_light"><strong>Device Information</strong>:&nbsp;We may collect information about your mobile
      device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and
      verions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion
      information, and mobile network information.
      <a class="linl_green" href="#"></a>
    </li>
    <li class="text_light"><strong>Call and SMS Data</strong>: Our Services facilitate communications between Users and
      Contractors. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of
      the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.
      <a class="linl_green" href="#"></a>
    </li>
    <li class="text_light">&nbsp;<strong>Log Information</strong>:&nbsp;When you interact with the Services, we collect
      server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages
      viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using
      before interacting with our Services.
      <a class="linl_green" href="#"></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="w-richtext">
    <p>Important Information About Platform Permissions
    </p>
    <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access
      without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS
      platform will alert you the first time the Contractors.com app wants permission to access certain types of data
      and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that
      the Contractors.com app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. </p>
    <p>
      Information We Collect From Other Sources
      <br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="text_m">We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect
    through our Services. For example:
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li class="text_light">If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Contractors.com account with a payment
      provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or
      website whose API we use, we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
    </li>
    <li class="text_light">When you request services, our Contractors may provide us with a User rating after providing
      services to you.
    </li>
    <li class="text_light">If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Contractor or
      user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected
      from you in your capacity as a User.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="w-richtext">
    <p><strong>Use of Information</strong>
    </p>

      updates and administrative messages;
    </li>
    <li class="text_light">Perform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and abuse of our
