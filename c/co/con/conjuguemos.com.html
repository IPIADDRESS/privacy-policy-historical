Our site offers a variety of activities which may be accessed by adults and children of all ages, including activities that may collect information from children.</p>   

<p>Where children access the website as part of a school program, their teacher, school, or school officials have authorized and designated them to have access to programs, applications, practice activities (including verb conjugation, vocabulary, grammar activities, flashcards, crosswords, worksheets, and/or other printable resources), quizzes, or tests on the website and CONJUGUEMOS does not provide any notice or seek consent from parents or guardians for this access and use.   For children accessing the website on their own, CONJUGUEMOS has set up procedures to comply with the law including providing notice of the information we collect, how we use the information, providing notice to parents about their child’s registration on the site where it is not done as part of an authorized school program, obtaining approval from parents prior to obtaining, using, and/or disclosure of personal information where not done as part of an authorized school program, and providing notice to parents of any material change to our privacy policy and practices.

We do not require children to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to access and participate in any on-line activities on the website.</p>

If you believe that your child is accessing our website and participating in programs, applications, practice activities, quizzes, or tests that are not part of an authorized school program on the website and you or another parent or guardian have not received an email providing notice to you and seeking your consent, you should contact CONJUGUEMOS at support@conjuguemos.com</p>                                             .
