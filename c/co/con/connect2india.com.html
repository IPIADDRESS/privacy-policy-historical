                        basic search functionality, resulting in inaccurate and irrelevant data returned to buyer and irrelevant inquiries received by suppliers.

                        sectors and most importantly the coverage percentage
                        of small & medium enterprises in these directories is very low, hence these directories do not cover all raw materials in a specified industry.<br/><br/><br/>

                        The non-integration of safe and specialized sourcing makes search, shortlist and select procedure cumbersome and time-consuming for both buyers and suppliers.

                        requirements, the absence of smart data (such as freight quotes, export history, reviews, ranking etc.) restrict buyer to select best supplier(s).
