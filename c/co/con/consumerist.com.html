<h1>Consumer Media LLC Privacy Policy</h1>

<br>
Effective January 1, 2009<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the Consumerist web site (located at
<a href="http://www.consumerist.com/">www.consumerist.com</a> or
www.consumerist.org) and any other web
sites (our "Sites" and each individually, a "Site") owned and operated by
Consumer Media LLC ("Consumer Media", "we" or "us").<br>
<br>
Consumer Media is a non-profit organization and an affiliate of Consumers Union
of United States, Inc. ("Consumers Union"), the independent, non-profit consumer
advocacy and testing organization, and publisher of Consumer Reports, whose
mission is to work for a fair, just and safe marketplace for consumers and to
empower consumers. To maintain our independence and impartiality, Consumer
Media, like Consumers Union, accepts no outside advertising, no freebies, and
has no agenda other than the interests of consumers.<br>
<br>
Our Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use the information you provide
when you visit our Sites. This Privacy Policy is part of the Consumer Media LLC
<a href="user.html">User Agreement</a>. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand
our privacy practices.<br>
<br>
<b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</b><br>
You can visit our Sites and view our content anonymously. For certain
activities, we collect information about you.<br>
<br>
The information we collect falls into two main categories: (1) personal
information you voluntarily supply to us to take advantage of certain features
of our Sites, some of which may identify you personally, and (2) tracking
information we collect as you navigate through our Sites.<br>
<br>
<b>Personal Information.<br></b>
You will need to provide us with personal information if you are interested in
obtaining certain information or participating in certain activities. Personal
information we collect may include your email address and a user name and
password. For example, if you wish to subscribe to a newsletter offered by one
of our Sites, we ask you to provide your email address. You may also elect to
leave comments on particular blog entries of interest, either as a guest, via
your Facebook account or as a registered member. Commenters have the option of
commenting anonymously.<br>
<br>
If we produce a mailing list for a Site to provide mailing list subscribers with
relevant information, for example, breaking news, or weekly or daily news
round-ups, then users will have to provide a valid email address to sign up for
emails from the list. We may ask mailing list subscribers to provide 
demographic information, such as geographic location, and to describe their
personal interests. Mailing list subscribers will receive regular emails from
our Site. Most of the time, these emails will contain solely content from Consumer Media, 
but we may send emails from an affiliated organization, that is, on behalf
of Consumers Union or the Consumers Union Action Fund, a non-profit organization
that helps work for pro-consumer legislative reform.<br>
<br>
To enhance the user experience, we may also provide forums, including message
boards, where users can discuss topics of common interest. To sign up for a
forum, users may have to submit personal information, including name, a valid
email address and certain demographic information.<br>
<br>
You may also provide us with information about other people. For example, you
might submit a person's name and email address in order to share an online
article.<br>
<br>
<b>Aggregate information collected through technology<br></b>
When you use our Sites we may collect tracking information such as your browser
type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet
service provider, and pages visited on the Sites. None of this information
identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on Site
activity. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on a
Site or which pages or features get the most attention. We use this information
to make our Sites more useful to you.<br>
<br>
Most aggregate information is collected via cookies or other technical methods.
We use cookies, Web beacons, and other technologies for analysis and
personalization services, which are described in more detail below.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Cookies:</b></i> We use "cookies" to store, and sometimes to track, user information in
certain areas of our Sites. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email
address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to
provide this information to us. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent
to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A
cookie contains a unique number that allows a Site to recognize your computer.<br>
<br>
We use temporary and persistent cookies. A temporary cookie tracks visitor
activity during a session or visit and it expires when you close your browser.
We use them to provide continuity for your visit as you visit web pages in our
Sites. Persistent cookies allow us to keep track of your user name and password
so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit a Site (or
Site area) that requires you to sign in. The Help function on most browsers
contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting
cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies,
you will not be able to take advantage of certain features on our Sites, for
example, you will not be able to use products or services that require you to
"sign in" with a user name and password.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Log Files:</b></i> We use log files to track usage of our Sites. Log files track
Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and the number of clicks
in order to enable us to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users'
navigation in the aggregate, and to gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use. This data is not linked to any personally identifiable
information we collect. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to
analyze user movement.<br>
<i><b><br>
Web beacons: </b></i>Our Sites and e-mails may use a variety of technical methods for
tracking purposes, including Web beacons. We use Web beacons (also known as
clear gifs) on some of our Sites in conjunction with cookies to compile
statistics about Site usage. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are
embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We use these technical methods to
analyze the traffic patterns on our Sites, such as the frequency with which our
users visit various parts of our Sites and to measure the effectiveness of a
given Site. We also use Web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send visitors to
our Sites who have agreed to receive e-mail from us, to determine whether our
recipients have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.
These technical methods allow us to make our Sites, and any emails you have
agreed to receive, more interesting to you. You may render some Web beacons
unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.<br>
<br>
On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally
identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish us with personally
identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in
the cookies or Web beacons. These technical methods may involve the transmission
of information either directly to us or to
other
parties authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.<br>
<br>
The following vendors provide services to us and may employ Web beacons on our
behalf. Because Web beacons utilize a cookie that can only be placed and "read"
by the third party provider, you should review the privacy policy of each
provider to answer any questions you may have regarding its cookie policy as
well as other options available to you, such as opting out of its specific
cookies.<br>
<br>
<b>X+1</b> provides us with ad serving, trafficking and reporting services for our
Sites. This visit analysis is facilitated by the use of Web beacons which
utilize an X+1 cookie. To view its privacy policy and learn how you can opt out
of cookies set to facilitate Web beacon reporting by them, <a href="http://www.xplusone.com/privacy.html">please click here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Our ads and content on other sites<br></b>
Except for our affiliates, we do not allow third-party ads on our Site. We may
place ads for products and services provided by our affiliates, which include
two non-profit organizations: Consumers Union and its various publications and
other products, and Consumers Union Action Fund, Inc., which works to educate
the public about consumer rights and consumer safety issues and to advance
consumer protection policies, among other advocacy activities.<br>
<br>
Consumers Union may use cookies on our Site, for example, to advertise its
products and services. Consumers Union's use of cookies is governed by its
privacy policy, which is <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/customer-service/privacy/index.htm">accessible here</a>.<br>
<br>
To prevent other sites from placing cookies on your computer, you will need to
visit each Web site and use their cookie-removal process or set your browser
cookie filter accordingly.<br>
<br>
<b>HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED<br></b>
We use the information you provide for the purpose for which it was collected.
We may also use your information to customize your experience. We may track what
online content you are interested in or use aggregate user information to assess
general user interest in various products and services. We do this to focus our
communications and provide you content and services we believe may be of
interest to you. We also use the information you provide to ensure compliance
with our User Agreement. If you contact us for help or for additional
information about a particular service, we will use the personal information you
provide to reply to you. We may also use the information you provide to send you
information and materials produced by us or our affiliates that we believe may
be of interest to you, for example, we may send you an email about a consumer
protection legislative proposal that Consumers Union Action Fund is supporting
before Congress or we may send you information about how to subscribe to
Consumer Reports or another Consumers Union publication. If you prefer not to
receive these types of communications, you can opt-out by following the
unsubscribe instructions included in the email communication and we will honor
your request promptly.<br>
<br>
We also use the information you provide about others to enable us to send them
the online content you requested, for example, to send an article to a friend.<br>
<br>
<b>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br></b>
We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain your privacy with respect
to your personal information. We will share your information only with our
affiliates, which include Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer
Reports magazine and ConsumerReports.org, and Consumers Union Action Fund, Inc.,
the affiliate of Consumers Union that helps work for pro-consumer legislative
reform.<br>
Except for sharing with our affiliates, and as described below, we will not share, exchange, sell or
rent your email address with any other third parties.<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing with service providers<br></b>
We contract with other companies to provide certain services on our behalf,
including hosting and email distribution. We provide these companies only with
the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are
restricted from using the information we provide in any way other than to
provide services for us and they may not share or resell this information.<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing for legal purposes<br></b>
<br>
From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our
businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a
part of the purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the
personally identifiable information received would be treated in accordance with
this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to share your personally identifiable information with
legal authorities if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order
or subpoena, or if we determine in our sole discretion that it is necessary to
investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, any
violations of our User Agreement, or in connection with any safety or security
concerns.<br>
<br>
Please be aware that if you register as a commenter on one of our Sites and a
third party subsequently complains that one or more of your comments breaches
our User Agreement (e.g., libels them or infringes their intellectual property
rights), then in accordance with our <a href="user.html">User Agreement</a>, we will make reasonable
efforts to contact you and alert you to the situation. If we are required to by
law to disclose your contact information, we will first attempt to contact you
to provide an opportunity to respond to such request.<br>
<br>
<b>SECURITY<br></b>
We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized
alteration. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial
procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
security, and correctly use the information we collect.<br>
<br>
<b>Security of the Personal Information You Provide<br></b>
<b>Personal Information. </b>We protect the confidentiality and security of your
personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as
firewalls, coupled with security procedures to protect your information from
loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that any information you include in a message you post
online in a public posting area on one of our Sites is available to anyone with
Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or other information
about you, do not include it in any message you post publicly or incorporate it
in a user name.<br>
<br><b>
Information use by our employees and agents.</b> Our employees are trained and
required to safeguard your information. Using physical, electronic and
procedural safeguards, our policies restrict access to personal information only
to those employees who need to access it for business purposes.<br>
<br>
<b>Security Enforcement<br></b>
Any unauthorized access to or use of our Sites or to the information collected
and maintained by us should be immediately brought to our attention by
contacting us
via
email (to security@consumermediallc.org) or by writing to us at Consumer
Media LLC Attn: Security, 101 Truman Avenue, Yonkers, NY 10703. We will
investigate, and, if necessary, take action to halt any violation of the
security of your personal information of which we become aware.<br>
<br>
<b>Security of Access to Your Online Account Information<br></b>
If you register to engage in certain activities on a Site, you are asked to
establish a user name and password. Providing an email address is optional, but
if you forget your password, we can send you an email to the email address you
used when you first registered with us that allows you to reset it. If we do not
have a valid email address associated with your user name and password, then you
will have to re-register if you forget your user name and password.<br>
<br>
We urge you to keep your password confidential and not disclose it to anyone.<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT </b>- Although we take these steps to protect your personal information,
no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure,
therefore we cannot promise or guarantee that such information will never be
accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy
Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY<br></b>
Our Sites are general audience web sites, and we do not knowingly collect
information from children under age 13. Should a child whom we know to be under
13 make known to us his or her personally identifiable information, we will use
that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her
that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personally
identifiable information and then we will delete that information.<br>
<br><b>
INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY<br>
</b>Consumer Media is a not-for-profit Delaware limited liability company
headquartered in Yonkers, New York, USA. We may have Site visitors and
registrants from countries around the world in addition to the United States. If
you are located outside of the United States, the personal information you
provide to us will be transferred to the United States and governed by
applicable U.S. laws and regulations and this Privacy Policy. Some of this
information may be transferred to, processed and stored temporarily by our
service providers in other countries. By submitting your personal information,
you consent to its transfer to and storage in the United States and other
countries designated by Consumer Media, its governance by U.S. laws and
regulations, and its use in accordance with the purposes for which it was
originally collected and as set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY<br></b>
This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time by posting the modified
policy on this web page, or if we determine that it's appropriate, we may post a
notice of the change elsewhere on our Sites. If we make a significant or
material change in the way we use your personal information, we will make you
aware by prominently posting a notice on our Sites. By continuing to use our
Sites after we have posted such modification or notice, you agree to the terms
of the modified privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<b>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES<br>
<br></b>
Our Sites may contain links to third-party Web sites for your convenience and
information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
