Please read our Privacy Policy, which explains what information we collect, how we use this information and what security measures are in place to protect your information. If we make any substantive changes to this policy, we'll announce it on our site and, if you have provided us with an e-mail address, by sending a notice to that address.

We keep a record of the information that you knowingly provide and choose to opt-in, such as name, address, e-mail address and e-mail preferences. This information may be collected from registration pages, survey pages, requests for information from manufacturers in our database and/or newsletter signup pages. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site, to provide you with the best and most personalized Web experience possible, to provide our sponsors with aggregate data on customers reached and their demographics and to allow our manufacturers to fulfill specific requests for more information about their products. The e-mail information you provide is only used for communication with you when you request e-mail, to send you periodic information and special offers from <b>Hanley Wood</b> and our sponsors, to provide updates on <b>Hanley Wood</b> offerings and features, to provide you with product information you have specifically requested from manufacturers in our database, and to provide notice of changes to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. <br></p> <p><b>Hanley Wood</b> conducts research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information you provide us when you register, participate in a contest or other promotion on our site, request information from a manufacturer in our catalog, request information from one of our advertisers, or from our server log files. This research is compiled and analyzed, and, except as described in this Privacy Policy, is disclosed only on an aggregated basis, so that information is only disclosed to third parties when grouped with the information of other users and is not associated with your name. We do this to better understand our users, improve your overall experience when using our service and to provide our sponsors with relevant aggregate data. From time to time, we may also collect information via surveys. Survey information will also used on an aggregated basis. <br></p> <p><b>Hanley Wood</b> may provide users with the opportunity to request additional information from product manufacturers in our catalog and/or from our advertisers. If you specifically request information from a manufacturer in our catalog and/or from one of our advertisers your demographic information will be shared with only the manufacturer and/or advertiser you are requesting information from, to allow them to decide the best way to fulfill your request.<br></p> <p><font class="heading2">Who do we share this information with?</font> </p> <p><b>Hanley Wood</b> will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Policy, or to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of <b>Hanley Wood</b>. <br></p> <p>With the exception of providing your postal address to a trusted third party mail processing facility, who agrees to keep your information confidential, for application to mailings of the same types as those for which we would use your e-mail information, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to third parties. Only aggregate information is provided to third parties. For example, we might tell advertisers that there are 100,000 registered users in Texas, but we won't tell them that you are one of them. We may use this aggregated information to help the sponsors reach the kind of audience they want via our e-mail advertising. Advertisers may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, marketing managers in the 78750 zip code). <b>Hanley Wood</b> would then take the ad and display it in an e-mail to users who "opted in" for e-mail and who've told us they meet those criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to an individual's member profile. Only <b>Hanley Wood</b> has access to an individual's member profile. <br></p> <p>If you use our "tell a friend" service to e-mail one of our articles, reports or product descriptions to a friend or colleague, <b>Hanley Wood</b> will automatically send this person a one-time e-mail, attaching the recommended content. Your e-mail address will appear on the "From" line of this e-mail, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the e-mail. The e-mail address of you or your friend or colleague will not be stored in our databases based on this service. <br></p> <p>We may employ contractors to help with our operations. Some or all of these contractors may access the databases of user information. These contractors are and will be subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with <b>Hanley Wood</b>. <br></p> <p>We do retain the right to share and transfer all user information with a purchaser of our company or all or substantially all of our assets if that purchaser agreed to abide by the terms of this Policy. <br></p> <p><font class="heading2">What Kind of Security Measures Do We Take to Protect Your Information from Accidental Loss or Disclosure?</font> </p> <p><b>Hanley Wood</b> is committed to protecting your personal information.
