    Collecting Personal Information
</p>

<p>
    We collect information about you when you make a purchase in one of our Stores, through our Contact Center, or
    through our Site. This information may include your name, mailing and billing address, zip code, phone number,
    and/or email address. We may also ask for this information if you choose to participate in a survey, sweepstakes,
    contest, promotion or giveaway. We consider information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email
    address or billing information, and other data that is linked to such information, to be personal information.
</p>

<p>
    With sales transactions, we may collect payment information including credit/debit card information, gift card and
    merchandise credit numbers, and/or checking account information. When you make a purchase in one of our Stores,
    through our Contact Center, or through our Site, we collect transactional information related to your purchase
    (i.e., what you bought, the price you paid, the payment method you used, and if the product was on sale).
</p>

<p>
    We use third-party partners to collect information about your use of our Site and your product preferences. If you
    have provided us with your personal information, information about your use of our Site and your preferences may be
    linked to your personal information so that we may more effectively market to you, or to help diagnose problems on
    our Site.
</p>

<p>
    We have software that allows us to re-create your sessions on our Site. We use this information to make our Site
    easier and more enjoyable to use. If you have provided us with your personal information, information about your use
    of our Site may be linked to your personal information, and we may use this information to contact you in order to
    address problems you may have experienced in using our Site.
</p>

<p>
    We also collect some personal information when you use other features of our Site. We collect your email address if
    you sign up for our email list. In order to establish an online account, you will be asked to provide your name,
    email address, and zip code, and you will also need to establish a password. If you use online chat to connect with
    our Contact Center, we will ask for your name and email address.  We may also permit you to sign on to your online
    account with The Container Store using log-in information (such as an e-mail address and password) you have
    established for using a social network profile or account (such as Facebook® or Twitter®).  If you choose
    to do so, those credentials may be communicated to and used by a third party service provider to authenticate
    your credentials and ensure that access to your account is obtained properly, and to facilitate your use of you
    social network log-in to access your account with us.  In addition, if you are a new customer and want to use
    your social network log-in to access your account with The Container Store, some information about you (such as
    your name, e-mail address, and location information) may be automatically delivered to us as part of the process
    by which you sign up for your account.
</p>

<p>
    You may be asked to provide additional information when you use our Site to develop personal organization projects,
    custom space designs, registries, or wish lists.  This information may be linked to personal information you have
    provided, such as your name.  In addition, we may provide you with the ability to use social networks to share
    information about product purchases or interests, registries, wish lists, or other activities in which you engage on
    the Site.  If you choose to share such information, your name and/or other personal information may be linked to the
    information you share about activities on our Site.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>You will be asked to provide personal information if you apply for a job with The Container Store using
    our online application process, as explained in the "Information Provided When You Apply for a Job Online"
    <a href="#11">section</a> below.</strong>

    Finally, The Container Store may permit you to submit information to our Ratings &amp; Reviews, our customers' real-life
    tips and our "What We Stand For" blog (collectively referred to as "Forums").  Your use of the Forums may reveal
    your user name, city and state, and may allow you to publish certain other personal information about yourself.
    Information you submit to our Forums, including your user name, and in some cases, your city and state, becomes
    publicly available and can be seen, collected, and used by others.  Once made public, this information cannot be
    made private again.  Therefore, you should exercise caution when deciding to submit information to our Forums, or
    disclosing information about yourself or others, and you should not submit or communicate any information to the
    Forums that you do not want to be seen, collected, or used by others.  We may link information you submit to our
    Forums to other information about you, including but not limited to your personal information and account
    information, but we will not publicly display your personal or account information other than as explained above.

    Browsing Our Website
</p>

<p>
    When you are using our Site, we log your <strong>IP address</strong> (a number that identifies your computer on
    the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting and to examine overall traffic trends. For example,
    IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as Google or
    Yahoo!. This information is collected in aggregate. It is also linked to your personal information if you provide
    your personal information to The Container Store.
</p>

<p>
    Another tool we use is called a <strong>cookie</strong>, which is a small data file stored on your computer that
    allows us to customize portions of our Site to your preferences. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you
    are, tailor our product selection to you, and to ensure that only you have access to your account and any personal
    organization projects, wish lists or custom space designs you have created with us. The cookie, by itself, doesn't
    provide any personal information, such as your name or email address. You can configure your browser to accept all
    cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help"
    menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) However, you may not be able to use some
    features of our Site if you set your browser to reject cookies.
</p>

<p>
    We also use cookies and other tools to collect information about how you use our Site (for example, information
    about what pages you look at, what terms you use in searching our Site, or what products you investigate or
    purchase). This information may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party service
    provider.  If you have an account with us, this information may be linked to your account in order to provide you
    with product recommendations.
</p>

<p>
    You can browse our Site and read our editorial content without providing any personal information. However, you must
    provide personal information in order to make a purchase.

<p class="section-header">
    How We May Use Your Information
</p>

<p>
    In order to serve you better, we may combine the information you provide us and the information we have from your
    purchases through our Site, through our Contact Center, online and in our Stores. We may also utilize information
    that is publicly available. This information, in total, is used to improve your overall experience with our company.
    Here are the ways we may use information about you in order to enhance your shopping experience at The Container
    Store:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To complete your purchases</strong>.  We use information about your transactions,
    including personal information you have provided, in order to process payments you have made and deliver products
    you have ordered. In doing so, we may transmit payment information to third parties, such as banks,
    credit card companies or payment clearance services. We may also provide shipping information to third parties in
    order to permit them to deliver products to you.
</li><br>
<li><strong>For marketing and promotional purposes</strong>.  We send targeted direct mail and catalogs to our customers
    about products or events that we think may be of interest, based on past purchases at The Container Store. We may
    also send offers for discounts or promotions and information about campaigns, new products or new features. In
    addition, we send email communications to let customers know about promotions, organizational tips, and the most
    up-to-date happenings at The Container Store.
</li><br>
<li><strong>To improve the content and navigation on our Site</strong>.  For example, we may use cookies or other tools
    to track which sections or products online are most often visited and in what order.
</li><br>
<li><strong>To enhance your online shopping experience</strong>.  For example, we may use information about you to
    recognize you and welcome you back to our Site, personalizing your shopping experience.
</li><br>
<li><strong>To make your use of our Site compatible with the social networks you use</strong>. For example, we and/or
    service providers we use may use your personal information to make it possible for you to access your account with
    The Container Store using the log-in information you use for your social network account, or in connection with
    allowing you to share information about your activities on our Site through your social networks.
</li>
</ul>

<p class="section-header">
    Sharing Your Information and Third-party Partnerships
</p>

<p>
    On occasion, The Container Store shares information collected from our customers with selected third-party companies
    that assist the company in advertising and marketing efforts. For example, we may retain an outside company to help
    us with customer research or to manage a customer database, to send catalogs or direct mail, or to send email
    messages. The information we provide to third parties for such purposes may include your name, address,
    email address, Site usage, and purchase information, which will help us target marketing communications.  The
    Container Store may also share your information with a marketing services provider that receives information from
    and provides information to many businesses. Thus, information about you may be shared with other businesses,
    and they may use it to contact you about their products and services. The Container Store also provides some
    anonymous information about customer purchases to third-party companies that assist us with advertising and
    promoting our products and services.
</p>

<p>
    You can opt out of receiving catalogs, e-mails and other marketing materials from us.  You may also opt out having
    your information shared with other business for purposes of marketing their products and services.  Information on
    how to opt out is provided <a href="#9">below</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We participate in special partnerships with other companies that we believe offer products or services that our
    customers would be interested in and would benefit from. We do not share customers' personal information with these
    partner companies. Customers may receive information about these partnerships and related promotions directly from
    The Container Store or from the third-party companies that assist us with marketing.
</p>

<p>
    The Container Store may also enter into a "co-branding" relationship with another company, or organization. At
    times, we may communicate with customers on behalf of that company and customers may be directed to a partner
    website to purchase a specific item or learn about their services. In these cases,
    both The Container Store and the partner company may receive personal information you provide.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, like many other companies, The Container Store may use outside marketing companies to place
    advertisements or links on other websites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information
    (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over)
    during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to
    be of interest to you.  These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this
    information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising
    by certain participating advertising networks, you can visit
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. The Container Store is not
    responsible for the collection or use of information by such marketing companies or third-party websites.
</p>

<p>
    Third parties may receive your personal information because you have visited their websites or accessed their links.
    Please refer to their privacy policies to learn about how they handle your personal information. Please note that
    The Container Store has no control over the privacy practices of other companies of websites, and we do not assume
    any responsibility or liability for any third-party's data collection or disclosure practices, their failure to
    abide by their privacy policies, or the content of their websites.
</p>

<p>
    In the event that The Container Store is merged with or acquired by another company, or in the event of a transfer
    of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and other information about usage of our Site in
    connection with such a transaction. In the event of such a transfer, we will notify you of the change of control of
    your personal information. You should also be aware that courts may have the authority under certain circumstances
    to permit personal information and other information about usage of our Site to be shared or transferred to third
    parties without your permission.

<p class="section-header">
    Disclosure of Your Personal Information
</p>

<p>
    We will not use or disclose your personal information except: (1) as described in this Privacy Policy; (2) after
    obtaining your permission to a specific use or disclosure; (3) if it is necessary to identify, contact or bring
    legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to The Container Store,
    or to others; (4) if we are required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental
    request (such as a court order, search warrant, subpoena, civil discovery request, or statutory requirement); or,
    (5) as we otherwise believe is required by law.

    Security of Our Site
</p>

<p>
    The Container Store maintains security procedures designed to keep information we own, license and process from
    being accessed by any unauthorized person or business. We use a variety of multi-level security systems to
    control access to our systems and the data that we house. Our enterprise security operations center maintains
    real-time monitoring for information system vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts into our internal
    systems. We also maintain physical security for our facilities and limit access to certain critical areas of our
    business.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we
    strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or
    from our Site, and you do so at your own risk. Accordingly, we disclaim liability for any theft, loss, or
    interception of, or any unauthorized access or damage to any data or communications. By using our Site,
    you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
</p>

<p>
    Anyone with access to the email address and password you use to create an account with us can obtain access to the
    personal information you have provided to us. We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not share it
    with anyone. Always sign out from your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to
    our Site. This ensures that others cannot access your account, which is especially important if you are sharing a
    computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.
</p>

<p>
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and you are responsible for any
    access to or use of our Site by any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been
    authorized by you.

    Opting Out
</p>

<p>
    While we hope that the information included in this Privacy Policy has helped you better understand how we use and
    protect your information to provide you with better service, we understand that you may still choose to not receive
    information from The Container Store or our partners.
</p>

<p>
    As a part of our commitment to your privacy, The Container Store supports and adheres to the guidelines adopted by
    the Direct Marketing Association's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers." We have agreed to: (1) provide customers
    with notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale or exchange with other marketers; (2) honor
    customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers; and, (3) honor customers' requests not to
    receive mail or email from The Container Store.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Information Rental, Sale or Exchange</b>. You may opt out of any exchange of personal information about you
      with other businesses for their own marketing purposes.  In order to do so, <a href="/preferences">click here</a>.
  </li><br>
  <li><b>Direct Mail Opt-Out</b>. All of our catalogs and direct mailers have information printed on them (generally on
      the address panel) giving customers notice on how to optout of our direct mail promotions. To be removed from
      future mailings from The Container Store, please call us at 1-800-733-3532. After the voice message, please follow
      the prompts to remove your name from our future mailings. You will be asked for your name, address and customer
      number as they appear on our mailings. Your request is processed as quickly as possible. Due to mailing lead times
      however, it is possible that you may receive a few more mailings from us. After six to eight weeks, you should no
      longer receive mailings from The Container Store. You may also opt out online at
      <a href="/preferences">www.containerstore.com/preferences</a>.
  </li><br>
  <li><b>Email Opt-Out</b>. All of our marketing emails include a link for unsubscribing to our emails. Registered
      users on our Site can also log on to the "My Account" section to change their email preferences. We will apply
      your unsubscribe request as quickly as possible. There may be promotional email campaigns in process and you may
      continue to receive emails from us for a few days. We require up to ten days to apply your unsubscribe request.
      After this time, you will no longer receive marketing emails from The Container Store. You may still receive
      emails regarding your transactions; for example, confirming that you have placed an order, that a product you have
      ordered has been shipped or a reminder of a pending elfa space design. You may also opt out online at
      <a href="/email/frequency.htm">www.containerstore.com/email/frequency.htm</a>.

    information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. By using our

    Information Provided When You Apply for a Job Online
</p>

<p>
    Our Site includes a feature ("Careers") that allows you to submit an online job application. When you submit an
    online application, you will be required to provide personal information, including but not limited to your name,
    contact information, job interests, educational and job history, and references. This information will be used by
    The Container Store to assess and process your application.
</p>

<p>
    The online application process is hosted and supported by a third-party service provider, HRsmart. HRsmart receives
    and stores the information you provide. HRsmart does not disclose the personal information it receives and maintains
    for The Container Store to anyone else.

</p>

<p>
    If we decide to interview you, we may print your application and use it during the interview process. If you are
    hired, your application becomes part of your employee file. If you are not immediately hired, your printed
    application is kept for one year and then typically will be destroyed. We may ask you to provide additional
    information during the interview or hiring process. We may also use the information you provide to contact you
    about your application; for example, to ask you to agree to a background check or to send you an offer letter.
</p>

<p>
    We do not share the information you provide in the online application to anyone outside of The Container Store and
    HRsmart, except as we believe is required by law.
