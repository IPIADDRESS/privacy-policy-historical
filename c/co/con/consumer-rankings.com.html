important. We have a strong commitment to providing excellent
service to all our customers and visitors of this Web Site,

Policy discloses how we collect personal information, the types of
personal information we receive and collect, our use of current and
former consumer information, as well as the steps that we take to
safeguard your information. If you use this site you explicitly
agree to the terms and conditions of the Consumer-Rankings.com
Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your use. If you do not
agree to this policy, please do not use the Consumer-Rankings.com
site. We hope that this disclosure will help increase your
confidence in our website and enhance your experience on the
Internet. Therefore, in compliance with industry standards and
regulations enforced typically by federal and state governments, we
abide by the following Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up
("Consumers") on this website ("Web Site") or any web site owned by
the owner of Consumer-Rankings.com. &nbsp;In addition, the owner of
Consumer-Rankings.com owns several other domain names that point to
this site, and we will from time to time add new sites that may or
may not be listed in this Privacy Policy. Please note that this
pledge applies only to sites maintained by the owner of
Consumer-Rankings.com and not to web sites maintained by other
companies or organizations to which we link. In addition, this
policy applies only to information collected by
Consumer-Rankings.com online, not offline. We may share the
personal information that you supply to us with other third party
businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our Consumers
via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These third party
businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and
applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
suppression and validation and email marketing. You can browse the
Consumer-Rankings.com web site at anytime without revealing any
personal information about yourself. There are, however, several
areas on our web site where we collect personal information from
you on a voluntary basis. Personal information is information about
you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address,
email address, or phone number that is not otherwise publicly
available ("Consumer PII" or "PII"). This information helps us
serve you better by enabling us:</p>

<p>(1) to process and fulfill your requests for products and
services<br>
 (2) to solicit your opinions and other feedback<br>
 (3) to conduct research<br>
 (4) to customize the advertising and content you see<br>
 (5) to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external
clients</p>

<p>We may collect personal information at the following
times:<br>
 (1) when you register to receive communications from this website
or any website owned by the owner of Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
 (2) when you seek information or apply for products and services
offered through this website or any website owned by the owner of
Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
 (3) when you enter promotions or sweepstakes offered by this
website or any website owned by the owner of
Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
 (4) when you provide personal information to us through feedback,
survey, or other forms hosted on this site or any website owned by
the owner of Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
 (5) when you apply for a job with Consumer-Rankings.com.</p>

<p>In addition, we may receive information about you from other
sources, such as service providers and unaffiliated third party
marketing companies, for tracking purposes. We may add the
information we receive about you to your existing account. Like
other web sites, we also automatically receive and record certain
types of information every time you visit us. We use "cookies" and
the other information to enhance your experience and present you
with personalized offers. Likewise, we use third-party advertising
companies to distribute and track advertisements appearing on our
web site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags to
measure advertising effectiveness.</p>

<h3>Legal Protection</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Consumer PII, as required,
to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and
quasi-governmental requests, judicial proceedings, court orders, or
legal process, and will establish or exercise our legal rights and
defend against legal claims at our discretion. We will share,
without notice to you, all information we possess in response to
court orders, subpoenas and to comply with government
investigations. At our discretion we will share information in
order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats
to the physical safety of any person, violations of
Consumer-Rankings.com's Terms of Use or as otherwise required by
law.</p>

<h3>Use and Sharing of Your Personally Identifiable
Information</h3>

<p>CONSUMER-RANKINGS.COM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO, AND WILL, SELL OR
TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE
IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. This includes sharing Consumer PII with
Consumer-Rankings.com partners, sponsors, advertisers, service
providers and marketers lookup and reference services and any other
entities that Consumer-Rankings.com believes are able to provide
Consumers with special offers and opportunities.
Consumer-Rankings.com prohibits the sale or transfer of Consumer
PII to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you the
opportunity to opt-out. Although Consumer-Rankings.com advises
everyone who receives Consumer PII from Consumer-Rankings.com to
support this Privacy Policy, Consumer-Rankings.com has no control
over such party's information handling practices and is not
responsible for any failure of such party to adhere to this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<p>Additionally, Consumer-Rankings.com may share Consumer PII in
aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies that wish to
reach a particular Consumer target audience (e.g., female Consumers
between the ages of 25-35, who have an average household income of
over $50,000.00). This information will allow these entities to
provide relevant offers to specific Consumers.</p>

<p>Finally, Consumer-Rankings.com may disclose Consumer PII in
order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to
governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; or (4)
protect the rights or property of Consumer-Rankings.com, the
Network Sites or other Consumers of this Site.</p>

<p>By registering and using this Web Site, Consumers acknowledge
that the processing of their Consumer PII for the purposes
described above may involve the transfer of such PII from within
the United States of America ("USA") to countries outside the USA
whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that
within the USA.</p>

<p>When you request quotes or request to be contacted through
Consumer-Rankings.com or our other sites that we operate, you are
authorizing us to share information with our business partners who
will contact you by (i) phone, including without limitation any
prerecorded telephone call to any telephone number including
without limitation any wireless telephone number, which could
result in charges to you, (ii) SMS text message, (iii) email, or
(iv) mail. We may also contact you through any of the above means.
If you do not want further communication from them or us, please
notify the person or entity that contacts you directly. We reserve
the right to make changes in this policy at any time.</p>

<h3>Business Transfer</h3>

<p>As with any other business, it is possible that
Consumer-Rankings.com in the future could merge with or be acquired
by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor
company will have access to the information maintained by
Consumer-Rankings.com, including customer account information. Any
successor company will continue to be bound by this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<h3>Minors</h3>

<p>You must be at least 18 years old to use this web site. We do
not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information about
visitors under 18 years of age. If you are under 18 years of age,
you may not use the services offered on our web site unless they
are used with the consent, permission and supervision of your
parents or guardians.</p>

<h3>Cookies and IP Addresses</h3>

<p>To serve you more efficiently and effectively, we use "cookies"
technology. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard
drive that contains information about the user. Cookies are not way
linked to Consumer PII. Once the user closes their browser, a
cookie typically terminates. Cookies enable a web site to
"personalize" itself for each user and reduce the time it takes for
pages to load on your computer. In order to optimize your
experience, cookies also help with the collection of customer
tracking data. We may also capture customer tracking data on some
of our partner's web sites, related to activity involved with the
completion of offers listed on our web site. This information is
used to monitor the performance of our partners. If you reject
cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
areas of our site will be limited. We also keep track of Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses and may disclose your IP address during the
course and scope of our business. An IP Address is a number that is
used by computers on the network to identify your computer every
time you log on to the Internet.</p>

<p>Some of our non-affiliated business partners (e.g., advertisers)
use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these
cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of our cookies only and
does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Clear Gifs</h3>

<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by
informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs
are not tied to users' personal information. We also use clear gifs
in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients
have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If
users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out
section within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from
our homepage by clicking here.</p>

<h3>Opting-Out</h3>

<p>We offer you choices when we ask for personal information,
whenever reasonably possible. We provide you the opportunity to
"opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used
for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. You may
decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies
in your browser, although some of our features or services may not
function properly as a result.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive newsletter and promotional
communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the
instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by
emailing or calling us per the information contained on our contact
page. You may continue to receive email communications from us up
to ten (10) business days from the time we receive your unsubscribe
request. Please note that Consumer-Rankings.com can only control
its own mailing list and policies. Third party advertisers that
maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that
advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties
directly in order to stop receiving their communications. Although
Consumer-Rankings.com only supports permission-based emails,
Consumer-Rankings.com does not obligate itself to restrict third
parties advertising Consumer-Rankings.com beyond that which is
required by applicable law.</p>

<h3>Advertisements &amp; Pop Up Windows</h3>

<p>On occasion, you may receive advertisements for
Consumer-Rankings.com from third parties. These advertisements are
served by the third party web site that you have visited or
directly from this website or any site owned by the owner of
Consumer-Rankings.com. In addition, such advertisements may be
placed by third party ad servers or ad networks. We maintain
relationships with a number of the third party ad networks
currently operating. You may find more information at the web site
of either the individual ad network or the network advertising
initiative. Your relationships, transactions and any opt-out
requests with any such third party are governed by the specific
policy such third party has, and not those of
Consumer-Rankings.com.</p>

<h3>Third Party Links</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide
to Consumer-Rankings.com.&nbsp; However, when you visit web sites
to which Consumer-Rankings.com provides a link, keep in mind you
will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own
privacy and security policies, and terms of use. If you choose to
obtain certain services through a third party site, the data
collected by the third party is governed by that third party's
privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy
regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to
review the privacy policies and terms of use of any other service
provider from whom you request services.</p>

<p>If Consumer-Rankings.com receives personal information from a
third party unrelated to any service offered on our site, the use
and disclosure of such information is governed by the agreement (if
any) between Consumer-Rankings.com and such third party.</p>

outside companies, to operate portions of the Consumer-Rankings.com
web site and/or to provide certain services including clerical,
information processing and shipping services. Although the
particular section of the web site may have a similar appearance as

information as is necessary for the provision of those services. We

safe and secure. These third parties are prohibited from using or

other than the job they were hired to do.</p>

features is governed by the privacy policy of the company providing
