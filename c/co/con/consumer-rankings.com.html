		service to all our customers and visitors of this Web Site,

		abide by the following Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

		<p>This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up
		("Consumers") on this website ("Web Site") or any web site owned by
		the owner of Consumer-Rankings.com. &nbsp;In addition, the owner of
		Consumer-Rankings.com owns several other domain names that point to
		this site, and we will from time to time add new sites that may or
		may not be listed in this Privacy Policy. Please note that this
		pledge applies only to sites maintained by the owner of
		Consumer-Rankings.com and not to web sites maintained by other
		companies or organizations to which we link. In addition, this
		policy applies only to information collected by
		Consumer-Rankings.com online, not offline. We may share the
		personal information that you supply to us with other third party
		businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our Consumers
		via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These third party
		businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and
		applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
		suppression and validation and email marketing. You can browse the
		Consumer-Rankings.com web site at anytime without revealing any
		personal information about yourself. There are, however, several
		areas on our web site where we collect personal information from
		you on a voluntary basis. Personal information is information about
		you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address,
		email address, or phone number that is not otherwise publicly
		available ("Consumer PII" or "PII"). This information helps us
		serve you better by enabling us:</p>

		<p>(1) to process and fulfill your requests for products and
		services<br>
		 (2) to solicit your opinions and other feedback<br>
		 (3) to conduct research<br>
		 (4) to customize the advertising and content you see<br>
		 (5) to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external
		clients</p>

		<p>We may collect personal information at the following
		times:<br>
		 (1) when you register to receive communications from this website
		or any website owned by the owner of Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
		 (2) when you seek information or apply for products and services
		offered through this website or any website owned by the owner of
		Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
		 (3) when you enter promotions or sweepstakes offered by this
		website or any website owned by the owner of
		Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
		 (4) when you provide personal information to us through feedback,
		survey, or other forms hosted on this site or any website owned by
		the owner of Consumer-Rankings.com.<br>
		 (5) when you apply for a job with Consumer-Rankings.com.</p>

		<p>In addition, we may receive information about you from other
		sources, such as service providers and unaffiliated third party
		marketing companies, for tracking purposes. We may add the
		information we receive about you to your existing account. Like
		other web sites, we also automatically receive and record certain
		types of information every time you visit us. We use "cookies" and
		the other information to enhance your experience and present you
		with personalized offers. Likewise, we use third-party advertising
		companies to distribute and track advertisements appearing on our
		web site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags to
		measure advertising effectiveness.</p>

		<h3>Legal Protection</h3>

		<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Consumer PII, as required,
		to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and
		quasi-governmental requests, judicial proceedings, court orders, or
		legal process, and will establish or exercise our legal rights and
		defend against legal claims at our discretion. We will share,
		without notice to you, all information we possess in response to
		court orders, subpoenas and to comply with government
		investigations. At our discretion we will share information in
		order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
		activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats
		to the physical safety of any person, violations of
		Consumer-Rankings.com's Terms of Use or as otherwise required by
		law.</p>

		<h3>Use and Sharing of Your Personally Identifiable
		Information</h3>

		<p>CONSUMER-RANKINGS.COM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO, AND WILL, SELL OR
		TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE
		IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. This includes sharing Consumer PII with
		Consumer-Rankings.com partners, sponsors, advertisers, service
		providers and marketers lookup and reference services and any other
		entities that Consumer-Rankings.com believes are able to provide
		Consumers with special offers and opportunities.
		Consumer-Rankings.com prohibits the sale or transfer of Consumer
		PII to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you the
		opportunity to opt-out. Although Consumer-Rankings.com advises
		everyone who receives Consumer PII from Consumer-Rankings.com to
		support this Privacy Policy, Consumer-Rankings.com has no control
		over such party's information handling practices and is not
		responsible for any failure of such party to adhere to this Privacy
		Policy.</p>

		<p>Additionally, Consumer-Rankings.com may share Consumer PII in
		aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies that wish to
		reach a particular Consumer target audience (e.g., female Consumers
		between the ages of 25-35, who have an average household income of
		over $50,000.00). This information will allow these entities to
		provide relevant offers to specific Consumers.</p>

		<p>Finally, Consumer-Rankings.com may disclose Consumer PII in
		order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to
		governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; or (4)
		protect the rights or property of Consumer-Rankings.com, the
		Network Sites or other Consumers of this Site.</p>

		<p>By registering and using this Web Site, Consumers acknowledge
		that the processing of their Consumer PII for the purposes
		described above may involve the transfer of such PII from within
		the United States of America ("USA") to countries outside the USA
		whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that
		within the USA.</p>

		<p>When you request quotes or request to be contacted through
		Consumer-Rankings.com or our other sites that we operate, you are
		authorizing us to share information with our business partners who
		will contact you by (i) phone, including without limitation any
		prerecorded telephone call to any telephone number including
		without limitation any wireless telephone number, which could
		result in charges to you, (ii) SMS text message, (iii) email, or
		(iv) mail. We may also contact you through any of the above means.
		If you do not want further communication from them or us, please
		notify the person or entity that contacts you directly. We reserve
		the right to make changes in this policy at any time.</p>

		<h3>Business Transfer</h3>

		<p>As with any other business, it is possible that
		Consumer-Rankings.com in the future could merge with or be acquired
		by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor
		company will have access to the information maintained by
		Consumer-Rankings.com, including customer account information. Any
		successor company will continue to be bound by this Privacy
		Policy.</p>

		<h3>Minors</h3>

		<p>You must be at least 18 years old to use this web site. We do
		not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information about
		visitors under 18 years of age. If you are under 18 years of age,
		you may not use the services offered on our web site unless they
		are used with the consent, permission and supervision of your
		parents or guardians.</p>

		<h3>Cookies and IP Addresses</h3>

		<p>To serve you more efficiently and effectively, we use "cookies"
		technology. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard
		drive that contains information about the user. Cookies are not way
		linked to Consumer PII. Once the user closes their browser, a
		cookie typically terminates. Cookies enable a web site to
		"personalize" itself for each user and reduce the time it takes for
		pages to load on your computer. In order to optimize your
		experience, cookies also help with the collection of customer
		tracking data. We may also capture customer tracking data on some
		of our partner's web sites, related to activity involved with the
		completion of offers listed on our web site. This information is
		used to monitor the performance of our partners. If you reject
		cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some
		areas of our site will be limited. We also keep track of Internet
		Protocol (IP) addresses and may disclose your IP address during the
		course and scope of our business. An IP Address is a number that is
		used by computers on the network to identify your computer every
		time you log on to the Internet.</p>

		<p>Some of our non-affiliated business partners (e.g., advertisers)
		use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these
		cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of our cookies only and
		does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

		<h3>Clear Gifs</h3>

		<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
		Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by
		informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny
		graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
		and are used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs
		are not tied to users' personal information. We also use clear gifs
		in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients
		have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
		communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If
		users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out
		section within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from
		our homepage by clicking here.</p>

		<h3>Opting-Out</h3>

		<p>We offer you choices when we ask for personal information,
		whenever reasonably possible. We provide you the opportunity to
		"opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used
		for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. You may
		decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies
		in your browser, although some of our features or services may not
		function properly as a result.</p>

		<p>If you no longer wish to receive newsletter and promotional
		communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the
		instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by
		emailing or calling us per the information contained on our contact
		page. You may continue to receive email communications from us up
		to ten (10) business days from the time we receive your unsubscribe
		request. Please note that Consumer-Rankings.com can only control
		its own mailing list and policies. Third party advertisers that
		maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that
		advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties
		directly in order to stop receiving their communications. Although
		Consumer-Rankings.com only supports permission-based emails,
		Consumer-Rankings.com does not obligate itself to restrict third
		parties advertising Consumer-Rankings.com beyond that which is
		required by applicable law.</p>

		<h3>Advertisements &amp; Pop Up Windows</h3>

		<p>On occasion, you may receive advertisements for
		Consumer-Rankings.com from third parties. These advertisements are
		served by the third party web site that you have visited or
		directly from this website or any site owned by the owner of
		Consumer-Rankings.com. In addition, such advertisements may be
		placed by third party ad servers or ad networks. We maintain
		relationships with a number of the third party ad networks
		currently operating. You may find more information at the web site
		of either the individual ad network or the network advertising
		initiative. Your relationships, transactions and any opt-out
		requests with any such third party are governed by the specific
		policy such third party has, and not those of
		Consumer-Rankings.com.</p>

		<h3>Third Party Links</h3>

		to Consumer-Rankings.com.&nbsp; However, when you visit web sites
		to which Consumer-Rankings.com provides a link, keep in mind you
		will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own
		privacy and security policies, and terms of use. If you choose to
		obtain certain services through a third party site, the data
		collected by the third party is governed by that third party's
		privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy
		regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to
		review the privacy policies and terms of use of any other service
		provider from whom you request services.</p>

		<p>If Consumer-Rankings.com receives personal information from a
		third party unrelated to any service offered on our site, the use
		and disclosure of such information is governed by the agreement (if
		any) between Consumer-Rankings.com and such third party.</p>

		otherwise stated.</p>

		information as is necessary for the provision of those services. We
