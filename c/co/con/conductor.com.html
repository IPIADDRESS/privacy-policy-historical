Conductor, Inc. (hereafter
referred to as "Conductor") wants you to fully understand our privacy
practices. This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and
disclosure of Personal Information through our websites located at
URLs: <a href="http://www.conductor.com" title="www.conductor.com">www.conductor.com</a>,
console.conductor.com, or any other Conductor owned site
collectively know as (the "websites"). "Personal Information" means
information that would allow a party to contact you, including, for
example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.
</p>
<p>
Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in
which we use and protect your personal information. Conductor reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and
without any notice by posting a revised Privacy Policy on our website.
Any such revision will become effective immediately upon posting.
</p>
<p>
<b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b>
</p>
<p>
We do not share, sell or rent your personal information to third
parties. Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use
of our websites, that information does not contain Personal
Information. Generally, we do not disclose Personal Information to
third parties. However, we may share Personal Information with our
contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add
to the functionality of the websites. If Conductor becomes part of
another organization, that organization will possess the Personal
Information collected by Conductor and it will assume the rights and
obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this
Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
We cannot ensure that your Personal Information will not be
disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to
disclose information to the government or third parties under certain
circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to
unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
</p>
<p>
<b>Communications</b>
</p>
<p>
If you have registered to receive email communications from us and
later change your mind, you may contact us to have your name removed
from our distribution lists. To Opt-out send an email to <a href="mailto:optout@conductor.com">optout@conductor.com</a>.
Please reference "Opt-Out" in your subject line and state in the body
of the email that you wish to have your name removed from the
distribution lists.
</p>
<p>
<b>Information We Collect and How We Use That Information</b>
</p>
<p>
Our registration forms require users to provide contact information,
including name, physical address, company information, website
information, website statistics, email address, and similar information
("Personal Information"). We store sensitive information from our
visitors, such as credit card information. We track data to monitor
utilization and ensure good customer experience.
</p>
<p>
We will use your Personal Information only to perform services you
have requested, including the completion of financial transactions. In
order to perform and complete these services and transactions, we may
provide personally identifiable information to third parties. We will
never sell or share your personal information with any third parties
other than for these services which you request or to comply with legal
requirements.
</p>
<p>
Conductor uses a single crawler that respects industry standards when gathering web data. We use your domain's robots.txt file to tell us which files we can search and which files to leave alone. You can also control how often we search your site. To learn more about Conductor's Caliperbot <a href="/Caliperbot" target="_blank"> click here.</a>

<p>
<b>Internet Protocol Address</b>
</p>
<p>
We collect Internet Protocol ("IP") address from all visitors to the
website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to
your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help
diagnose problems with our server, administer our website, analyze
trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for
aggregate use in order for us to improve the website, and deliver
customized, personalized content.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use of "Cookies"</b>
</p>
<p>
Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site. The
cookies sets by the Conductor servers are unique, anonymous numbers.
They are stored by your browser on your hard drive. Cookies do not
contain any personally identifiable information about you. If you
choose not to accept the cookie, this will affect your access to the
majority of facilities available on our website.
</p>
<p>
Although your browser may be set up to allow the creation of
cookies, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a
cookie on your hard disk, so that you can decide whether to allow or
disallow the cookie. Alternatively, you can set your computer not to
accept any cookie. If you turn cookies off, you will not have access to
some features that make your site experience more efficient and some of
our services may not function properly.

<p>
<b>Security</b>
</p>
<p>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Log file
access is restricted to system administrators while stored on the
server. Log files are rotated regularly and archived in a secure
location.
</p>
<p>
All credit card information is encrypted before it is transmitted
across the network or stored in our systems. We use strong encryption
as mandated by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards
developed by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover Card.
Conductor complies with all statutory and legal requirements with
respect to access to information.
