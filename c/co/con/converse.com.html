	We understand that your trust in us is our most important asset online. In order to preserve that trust we want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it.
	<br><br>
	In order to provide an enjoyable and first-rate experience online, we use technology to create personal experiences on our website and to manage and maintain customer information.
	<br><br>
	This notice describes the Converse.com Privacy Policy and the practices we follow. It also explains what types of information we collect and under what circumstances we may share it. Please note that this Privacy Policy supersedes any prior policy that we have issued.
	<br><br>
	From time to time we may change our Privacy Policy. Your use of our Site following such changes means that you agree to the new Privacy Rules as changed.
	<br><br>
	These rules --specifically including the "Customer Information Policy", "Use of Cookies", "Use of IP Addresses", and "Security" paragraphs below --apply to this website only and not to any other website or business activity of Converse Inc. 
	<br><br>
	<span class="headtext">Customer Information Policy</span><br>
	At the present time the Converse site is designed for audiences 13 years of age and above. Converse does collect customer information on those users who are 13 years of age or older in an effort to improve our customers' shopping experience. Converse recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. The information collected is used to help us respond to customer inquiries, send emails about sales and events, contact contest winners and/or ship and bill orders. The information also helps us in determining what products appeal to our customers so we can better merchandise our site. 
	<br><br>
	We may use customer information for marketing and promotional purposes. Each promotional email we send comes with a link that enables our customers to unsubscribe or remove themselves from our mailing list. We do not currently sell online customer information to any outside company or third party. 
	<br><br>
	We maintain strict policies and security controls to assure that customer information in our computer systems and files is protected. Our employees and affiliates are permitted access only to customer information that they may need to perform their jobs and to provide service to you. All employees and affiliates are required to respect customer privacy.
	<br><br>
	<span class="headtext">Use Of Cookies</span><br>
	What is a cookie? A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your computer's hard drive to help our site recognize you when you return to our site. Cookies are used as a standard practice by many sites. An example of how we use this function could be if you started to place items in your shopping cart, but then for some reason had to leave our site or shut off your computer. When you return to our site, the cookie would enable our site to recognize that you have returned and all the items you placed in your cart during an earlier session would still be in your shopping cart. 
	<br><br>
	We also use cookies to determine the number of people that come to our site. It is important for us to understand the number of new customers using our site. When your computer accepts the cookie, we are able to record that session as a new visitor to our site. 
	<br><br>
	As important as cookies are to our site, we understand that this might make you uncomfortable. If you would prefer to not accept cookies from ours or any other site, you can modify the setting on your specific web browser to not accept them. Please refer to your browser's online help feature or the user's manual for instructions on how to do this. 
	<br><br>
	<span class="headtext">Use Of IP Addresses</span><br>
	An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you get on to the internet. Your computer's IP address is used by our site for administration purposes and to report aggregate traffic information to our affiliates and advertisers. Our site does not tie personal information to an IP address. 
	<br><br>
	<span class="headtext">Security</span><br>
	While no online transaction is 100% secure, Converse strives to protect your personal information to the best of our ability. Users have the option of using a Secure Checkout feature when placing an order on our site. This option uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption to protect any personal information including your credit card number.
