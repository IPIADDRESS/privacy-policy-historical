				<p><b>Our Commitment to Privacy</b><br>
				  Convergys intends to give you as much control as possible over your
				  personal information. We are committed to protecting your personal
				  privacy. We provide this privacy policy to explain the type of information
				  we collect on our Web site, www.convergys.com. This policy also
				  explains the choices you can make about the way your information
				  is collected and used.</p>
				<p><b>The Information We Collect</b><br>
				  This policy applies to all information submitted on this Web site.
				  In general, you can visit convergys.com without telling us who you
				  are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times,
				  however, when we may need information from you (such as your name
				  and address) to be able to provide you with the information, service
				  or product you have requested. We do keep track of the domains from
				  which people visit our site. We analyze this data for trends and
				  statistics about site traffic. We also may use your IP address to
				  help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web
				  site. Your IP address may be used to help identify you and to gather
				  broad demographic information.</p>
				<p>We, or one of our business partners, may from time to time also 
				  ask for other personal information via the Internet. We may use 
				  this information to correspond with you to process an order or to 
				  provide you with a subscription to an online newsletter, for example. 
				  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used 
				  as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. 
				  Users may choose to opt-out of receiving future e-mail or mailings 
				  by following the <a href="#unsubscribe">unsubscribe procedures</a> 
				  below.</p>
				<p><b>The Way We Use Information</b><br>
				  Convergys.com provides you with the opportunity to register on the
				  site through our <a href="request.html">Request for Information
				  form</a>. When you register with our Web site, you can elect to
				  receive information and updates on our products and services.</p>
				<p>We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail that we receive, 
				  and we may use return e-mail to send you other information.</p>
				<p>We use information that you provide (individual and aggregate) 
				  to better design our Web site and to enhance our marketing strategy 
				  and our products. One method through which this Web site collects 
				  aggregate information is the collection of IP addresses. An IP address 
				  is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever 
				  you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve 
				  up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
				  When you request a page from this Web site, our servers log your 
				  IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, 
				  so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous 
				  to us. To the extent such information is shared with third parties, 
				  please see "<a href="#third">Our Privacy Practices With Third Parties</a>," 
				  below.</p>
				<p>Occasionally, you may have the opportunity to forward pages or 
				  information on our Web site to friends or colleagues. The information 
				  you provide to facilitate this e-mail communication is collected 
				  by Convergys to correspond with you to process an order, to process 
				  a request for information, or to provide you with other forms of 
				  information, such as an online newsletter.</p>
				<p><b><a name="unsubscribe"></a>Convergys Unsubscribe Policy<br>
				  </b>By registering on the Convergys Web site, visitors allow Convergys 
				  to use their personal identifiable information in accordance with 
				  the terms of Convergys’ privacy policy and legal statement. 
				</p>
				<p>Convergys provides site visitors with the opportunity to opt-out 
				  of receiving updates on Convergys products and services, newsletters 
				  and other promotional materials. You may choose not to be contacted 
				  in the future if you do not wish to receive any information with 
				  respect to Convergys and our products and services. Visitors may 
				  unsubscribe at any time, by sending an e-mail to<a href="mailto:marketing@convergys.com"> 
				  marketing@convergys.com </a>or by calling 1-800-344-3000 and stating 
				  the request. Convergys' mailing address may be found on our <a href="contact.html">Contact 
				  Us Web page</a>. Visitors should provide Convergys with their name, 
				  address, other relevant information (e.g., phone number, e-mail 
				  address) and the name of the programs from which they wish to be 
				  removed.</p>
				<p>Convergys will use reasonable efforts to honor opt-out requests 
				  as soon as possible. If after a reasonable time a visitor is still 
				  receiving e-mail from Convergys, the visitor should contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@convergys.com">webmaster@convergys.com</a>.<br>
				</p>
				<p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
				  Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored in 
				  your computer's hard drive when you visit a Web site. We use cookies 
				  to better tailor our site and our products/services to your interests 
				  and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future 
				  activities or to improve your user experience by remembering the 
				  information that you have already provided to us. We do not use 
				  cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not 
				  voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration 
				  or a contest entry). The use of cookies is an industry standard 
				  and you will find them at most Web sites. Most browsers are initially 
				  set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser 
				  to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent so 
				  that you can flush them from your browser if you object to their 
				  presence.</p>
				<p><a name="third"></a><b>Our Privacy Practices with Third Parties</b>
				<br>
				  One of our business partners may from time to time also ask for
				  other personal information via the Internet. They may use this information
				  to correspond with you to process an order or to provide you with
				  a subscription to an online newsletter, for example. If you tell
				  us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis
				  for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. Users
				  may choose to opt-out of receiving future e-mail or mailings by
				  e-mailing us at webmaster@convergys.com.</p>
				<p>Occasionally, we may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable 
				  information about our users with our business and alliance partners. 
				  Other than our business and alliance partners, we do not provide 
				  personal identifiable information to any third party for any purpose 
				  whatsoever.</p>
				<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
				  Users should be aware that when you are on this Web site you could
				  be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may
				  be links to other sites that take you outside our service; for example,
				  links to business/alliance partners and trade show companies. These
				  other sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect
				  data or solicit personal information. If the Convergys Web site
				  links you to any third-party Web site, we make no representation
				  as to the existence, sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of their
				  Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b><br>
				  We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information
				  secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
				  managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We
				  cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online,
				  and you do so at your own risk.</p>
