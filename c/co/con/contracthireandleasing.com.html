<h2>Using the Website</h2>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> You must be 18 or over to use the Website.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The Website allows you to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. where you have been invited to do so, submit an application for a car lease deal to an advertiser ('the <strong>Application Functionality</strong>').</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> You are allowed to use the Website and the results of any search you carry out on the Website for the purposes set out above, unless this is not allowed under the <span style="font-style:italic;">your use of the Website</span> section of these conditions.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Prices of car deals made available on the Website by advertisers are for information purposes only and do not constitute an offer by advertisers which is capable of acceptance by you.

<p><strong>5.</strong> The information contained on the Website and from any communication related to the Website does not constitute financial advice. </p>

<h3>Personal data</h3>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> We process information about you in line with our <a href="#privacypolicy"><strong>privacy policy</strong></a>. By using the Website, you agree to the way in which we process your personal information. </p>
<h3>Your use of the website</h3>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> You cannot use the Website:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. for any unlawful purpose; to harm, threaten, abuse or harass another person, or in a way that invades someone's privacy or is (in our reasonable opinion) offensive or is unacceptable or damaging to us; to create, check, confirm, update or amend your own or someone else's databases, records, directories, customer lists, mailing or prospecting lists;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. to tamper with, update or change any part of the Website;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. in a way that affects how it operates;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. to transmit any material that is defamatory, offensive or otherwise objectionable; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. in a way that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large burden on our technical systems as determined by us; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. using any automated means to monitor, copy or scrape the Website or its content, or to interfere with or attempt to interfere with how the Website works.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You shall not input any personal data relating to any other person to the Website. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Unless otherwise stated, these conditions shall apply to all Websites operated by us from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The Website may contain links to other independent websites which are not operated by us. Such websites are not under our control and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement about whether to use any such independent websites, including whether to buy any products or services offered by them.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> We do not guarantee that the Website, or any content on it, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of the Website for business and operational reasons. </p>
<h3>Application functionality</h3>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> If you use the Application Functionality, the following terms shall apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. we act as a credit broker and not a lender;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. we will transfer all the information inputted by you to an application form (including your personal data) to the advertiser who has invited you to complete such application form (who may also share this information with a lender on who behalf they are acting) to determine your eligibility for credit;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. the application form is an application for finance. Before completing and submitting the form you should ensure that you fully understand the finance for which you are applying and the terms upon which such finance may be granted;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. an invitation to apply for finance is not an offer of finance capable of your acceptance and we provide no guarantee that your application will be accepted by the relevant advertiser or result in entry into a finance deal;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. an invitation for an application may be withdrawn by the advertiser or rejected by you at any time prior to submission of the application to the advertiser. We provide no guarantees or representations in respect of the continued availability of any invitation to make an application; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. you are solely responsible for ensuring that all information inputted by you into the application form is complete, accurate and up to date and that the vehicle and lease agreement in respect of which you are making an application is the correct agreement; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. you understand that a check in respect of your credit history may be carried out by the advertiser following receipt of your application to determine your eligibility for the lease agreement. This will leave a record on your credit history which could (particularly if multiple checks are performed in a short period of time) adversely affect your credit score and affect your ability to apply for future credit, regardless of whether a lease agreement is entered into; and </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h. you may only complete an application form on your own account and shall not complete an application form on behalf of any other person save where you are applying for a business leasing deal and have been duly authorised by the relevant applicant to make such application on their behalf.</p>
