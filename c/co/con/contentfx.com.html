<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif">A cookie is a very small text document, which
often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web
site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to
store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to
your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to
protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to
access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent
to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter
the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose
to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas
of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the
users.</font></span> <font face="Verdana, Sans-Serif"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">A cookie cannot retrieve any

site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some
cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in
more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with
our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate
number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site
are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly
improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not
allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not
intentionally store any personal information that your browser
provided to us in your cookies.</font></span></p>
