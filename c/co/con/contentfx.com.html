<strong>2. Web Site Use
Information</strong></span></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Similar to
other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard
technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are
Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about
how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and
Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages
viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just
before and just after our Web site.</span></p><br>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">What Are Cookies?</span></strong></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">A cookie is a very small text document, which
often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web
site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to
store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to
your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to
protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to
access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent
to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter
the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose
to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas
of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the
users.</span> <b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">A cookie cannot retrieve any
other data from your hard drive or pass on computer
viruses.</span></b></p><br>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">How Do We Use Information We Collect from
Cookies?</span></strong></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">As you visit and browse our Web site, the
site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some
cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in
more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with
our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate
number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site
are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly
improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not
allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not
intentionally store any personal information that your browser
provided to us in your cookies.</span></p><br>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">IP Addresses</span></strong></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">IP addresses are used by your computer every
time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number
that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer.
IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part
of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data
(such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to
you.</span></p><br>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Sharing and Selling
Information</span></strong></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease
any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as
email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the
extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services
that you have requested.</span></p><br>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">How Can You Access and Correct Your
Information?</span></strong></p><br>

identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our
database by emailing us at the usual address.</span></p><br>

What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of
Information?</span></b></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in
other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires
it or for the protection of our legal rights.</span>
  <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">We may also
  disclose account information when we have reason to believe
  that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,
  contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
  violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of
  our users and the Public.</span></p><br>

employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the
information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web
sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that
may be useful to the users of our Web site.</span></p><br>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Please remember that when you use a link to
go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no
longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web
site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is
subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over
those rules and policies before proceeding.</span></p><br>

<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">From time-to-time our site requests
information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in
these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user
