 <p class="question"> <strong>Do you use 'Cookies'? </strong>  </p><p>
"Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this Site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this Site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.  
      </p>
 <br><br>
      <p class="question"><strong>Do you obtain information regarding Computer Profiles? </strong>  </p><p>
  ConsumerGain.com may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, ConsumerGain.com may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enabled. Unless you provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not use such visitor data to identify you. </p>
      <p class="question">  <br><br>
          <strong>Do you track information by IP Addresses ? </strong>  </p><p>
  We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.  

      </p> <br><br>
      <p class="question"><strong>In what location do you store data? </strong> </p><p>
  Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which ConsumerGain.com or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  
    
  We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, and "firewalls." We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, perfect security does not exist on the Internet. </p>
      <p class="question"> 
 <br><br>
          <strong>Are there restrictions to this privacy policy? </strong>  </p><p>
  Yes, this Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. The Site contains links that direct you to websites owned and operated by other companies. In particular, when you take advantage of a promotional offer, you will be directed to the web sites of our marketing partners that will also collect your personal information, such as credit card companies. ConsumerGain.com does not control, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites, which may employ cookies and/or collect personal information. In addition, ConsumerGain.com will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third party site. Please be sure to read the privacy policy of each third party website that you visit.
