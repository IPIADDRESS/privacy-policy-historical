		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <p>
              Your privacy is important to ContentWatch Inc. To
              better protect your privacy, we have provided this
              statement which explains our online information
              practices, and the choices regarding the way your
              personal information is collected and used. We hope
              this statement will increase your confidence in our
              Web site and enhance your experience on the Internet
              with ContentWatch Inc.</p>

              <p><strong>Important note:</strong> In order to
              receive important product updates, notification of
              product error fixes, or other relevant ContentWatch
              information, you must choose to receive email
              messages from us. Please keep in mind that if you
              choose not to receive email messages, we will be
              unable to communicate with you via email.</p>

              <p><strong>1. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE.</strong> There
              are several activities on our Web site where the
              collection of personally identifiable information is
              necessary, such as when you enter a contest or
              sweepstakes, make a purchase, subscribe to a service
              or contact us. You will know when personally
              identifiable information is collected because you
              will be asked to complete a form. Generally, we
              collect only your name, email address, gender,
              physical address and telephone and facsimile
              number(s). When you make a purchase, we will also
              collect your credit card information.</p>

              <p><strong>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</strong> In
              addition to the information you provide, when you
              visit our Web site, we may collect information
              regarding the type of browser you are using (e.g.,
              Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.), the type of
              operating system you are using (e.g., Windows, Mac
              OS, etc.) and the domain name of your Internet
              service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink,
              etc.). This non-personally identifiable information
              is used to make our Web site as highly usable as
              possible for the widest variety of users. We also
              maintain a count of the files detected with
              ContentAudit, along with a count of the files cleaned
              with ContentCleanup. Actual file names and personally
              identifiable information is not tracked or recorded
              by ContentWatch.</p>

              <p>We may also receive and store certain types of
              information automatically through the use of
              "cookies." Cookies are pieces of information that a
              Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing
              the Web site. We use cookies to track important
              information (e.g., to track items you order) and to
              tell us whether you have visited our Web site before.
              We do not use cookies to obtain personal information
              about you from your computer. You may set your
              computer to warn you each time a cookie is sent, or
              you may set your computer to turn off all cookies,
              but this will limit some functionality of our Web
              site.</p>

              <p>We may also use email links located on our Web
              site to allow you to contact us directly with any
              questions or comments you may have. The information
              you provide in such emails is used to respond
              directly to your questions or comments, but may also
              be used to improve our Web site and its content. We
              may also review and discard the information provided
              in such emails.</p>

              <p><strong>3. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION.</strong> We
              may use the personally identifiable information that
              you provide, as well as the non-personally
              identifiable information that we otherwise collect
              about you, to fulfill your requests for our products,
              programs and services (e.g., billing, shipping,
              etc.), to respond to your inquiries about our
              offerings, to offer you other products, programs or
              services that we believe may be of interest to you,
              and to otherwise contact you. These products,
              programs and services may be ours or those of our
              trusted subsidiaries, affiliates, business partners
              or sponsors. Our desire is to only market to our
              opted in users, those products, programs and services
              that may be of interest. You will have an opportunity
              to opt out or block such marketing at any time.</p>

              <p>We will never disclose your credit card
              information or your personal identity information for
              marketing purposes. However, we may disclose
              personally identifiable information in response to
              legal process, for example, in response to a court
              order or a subpoena or a law enforcement agency's
              request. We may disclose personally identifiable
              information in connection with the sale of some or
              all of our assets or our business.</p>

              <p>We may use or allow reputable third parties to
              present or serve the advertisements that you may see
              on our Web pages. In addition, some business
              advertisements are managed and placed on our Web
              pages by third party companies. This Privacy
              Statement does not cover any use of information that
              a third party ad server or network advertiser may
              collect from you.</p>

              <p><strong>4. OPT OUT POLICY.</strong> You may 
              request at any time that ContentWatch Inc. not send
              any future email to you by unsubscribing from the
              communication within <a href="/account/unsubscribe.php">My Account</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>5. SECURITY WE PROVIDE.</strong> We have
              attempted to place appropriate physical, electronic
              and managerial procedures to safeguard and help
              protect against unauthorized access, maintain data
              security and correctly use the information we
              collect. Agents and contractors of ContentWatch Inc.
              who have access to personally identifiable
              information are required to protect this information
              in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
              Statement. Although we take appropriate measures to
              safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
              personally identifiable information, we cannot assure
              you that your personally identifiable information
              will never be disclosed in a manner that is
              inconsistent with this Privacy Statement. We protect
              the security of your credit card information using
              secure socket layer (SSL) encryption.</p>

              <p>Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites.
              We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
              the content of any such Web sites.</p>

              <p>This Privacy Statement is subject to change at any
              time, at the discretion of ContentWatch Inc. However,
              if we determine to change this Privacy Statement in
              any material aspect, we will notify you of such
              changes by email.</p>

              <p><strong>6. HOW WE HANDLE CHILDREN'S
              PRIVACY.</strong> We do not target or sell products,
              programs or services to children. Children under 13
              years of age may not submit personally identifiable
              information without the consent of a parent. We do
              not provide any personally identifiable information
              about children under 13 years of age to any third
              party for any purpose whatsoever.</p>

              <p><strong>7. HOW YOU CONTACT US.</strong> If you
              need further assistance, if you have any questions or
              concerns, or if you would like to modify your
