              Your privacy is important to ContentWatch Inc. To better protect 
              your privacy, we have provided this statement which explains our 
              online information practices, and the choices regarding the way 
              your personal information is collected and used. We hope this statement 
              will increase your confidence in our Web site and enhance your experience 
              on the Internet with ContentWatch Inc.</p>
            <p> <b>Important note:</b> In order to receive important product updates, 
              notification of product error fixes, or other relevant ContentWatch 
              information, you must choose to receive email messages from us. 
              Please keep in mind that if you choose not to receive email messages, 
              we will be unable to communicate with you via email.</p>
            <p> <b>1. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE.</b> There are several activities 
              on our Web site where the collection of personally identifiable 
              information is necessary, such as when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, 
              make a purchase, subscribe to a service or contact us. You will 
              know when personally identifiable information is collected because 
              you will be asked to complete a form. Generally, we collect only 
              your name, email address, gender, physical address and telephone 
              and facsimile number(s). When you make a purchase, we will also 
              collect your credit card information. </p>
            <p><b>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</b> In addition to the information 
              you provide, when you visit our Web site, we may collect information 
              regarding the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet 
              Explorer, etc.), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., 
              Windows, Mac OS, etc.) and the domain name of your Internet service 
              provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink, etc.). This non-personally 
              identifiable information is used to make our Web site as highly 
              usable as possible for the widest variety of users. We also maintain 
              a count of the files detected with ContentAudit, along with a count 
              of the files cleaned with ContentCleanup. Actual file names and 
              personally identifiable information is not tracked or recorded by 
              ContentWatch.</p>
            <p> We may also receive and store certain types of information automatically 
              through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are pieces of 
              information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are 
              viewing the Web site. We use cookies to track important information 
              (e.g., to track items you order) and to tell us whether you have 
              visited our Web site before. We do not use cookies to obtain personal 
              information about you from your computer. You may set your computer 
              to warn you each time a cookie is sent, or you may set your computer 
              to turn off all cookies, but this will limit some functionality 
              of our Web site.</p>
            <p> We may also use email links located on our Web site to allow you 
              to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. 
              The information you provide in such emails is used to respond directly 
              to your questions or comments, but may also be used to improve our 
              Web site and its content. We may also review and discard the information 
              provided in such emails.</p>
            <p><b>3. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION.</b> We may use the personally 
              identifiable information that you provide, as well as the non-personally 
              identifiable information that we otherwise collect about you, to 
              fulfill your requests for our products, programs and services (e.g., 
              billing, shipping, etc.), to respond to your inquiries about our 
              offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services that 
              we believe may be of interest to you, and to otherwise contact you. 
              These products, programs and services may be ours or those of our 
              trusted subsidiaries, affiliates, business partners or sponsors. 
              Our desire is to only market to our opted in users, those products, 
              programs and services that may be of interest. You will have an 
              opportunity to opt out or block such marketing at any time.</p>
            <p> We will never disclose your credit card information or your personal 
              identity information for marketing purposes. However, we may disclose 
              personally identifiable information in response to legal process, 
              for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or a law 
              enforcement agency’s request. We may disclose personally identifiable 
              information in connection with the sale of some or all of our assets 
              or our business.</p>
            <p> We may use or allow reputable third parties to present or serve 
              the advertisements that you may see on our Web pages. In addition, 
              some business advertisements are managed and placed on our Web pages 
              by third party companies. This Privacy Statement does not cover 
              any use of information that a third party ad server or network advertiser 
              may collect from you.</p>
            <p> <b>4. OPT IN POLICY.</b> You will have the opportunity to opt 
              in to receive email communications from ContentWatch Inc. You may 
              also request at any time that ContentWatch Inc. not send any future 
              email to you by unsubscribing from the communication by emailing 
              <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@contentwatch.com">unsubscribe@contentwatch.com</a>. 
            </p>
            <p><b>5. SECURITY WE PROVIDE.</b> We have attempted to place appropriate 
              physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and 
              help protect against unauthorized access, maintain data security 
              and correctly use the information we collect. Agents and contractors 
              of ContentWatch Inc. who have access to personally identifiable 
              information are required to protect this information in a manner 
              that is consistent with this Privacy Statement. Although we take 
              appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures 
              of personally identifiable information, we cannot assure you that 
              your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed 
              in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Statement. We 
              protect the security of your credit card information using secure 
              socket layer (SSL) encryption.</p>
            <p> Our Web site may contain links to other Web sites. We are not 
              responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such 
              Web sites.</p>
            <p> This Privacy Statement is subject to change at any time, at the 
              discretion of ContentWatch Inc. However, if we determine to change 
              this Privacy Statement in any material aspect, we will notify you 
              of such changes by email.</p>

              or sell products, programs or services to children. Children under 
              13 years of age may not submit personally identifiable information 
              without the consent of a parent. We do not provide any personally
