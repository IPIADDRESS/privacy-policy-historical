	Commitment to Privacy
</h3>
<p>
	As a security software producer, CONNECTIFY knows that you care about how your information is used and shared. We respect your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. We want to make sure that you understand the type of information we collect about you, how it is used and the safeguards we use to protect it. This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information you share with us.
</p>
<h3>
	What Information Does CONNECTIFY Collect? 
</h3>
<p>
	The type of information that we collect and retain depends upon your interaction with our Site. Here is a short overview of the two main types of interactions. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Information You Give Us. We collect the personally identifiable information you provide to us on our Site, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, and if you pay by credit card, your account information when you:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Create a user account, place an order, register a product (information we collect is necessary to complete the transaction and so that we can keep you informed about CONNECTIFY products and services, such as your name, last name, e-mail address, and country).</li>
	<li>Requesting product support or other services (information we collect is necessary to, provide support and to respond to queries such as your name and address and information about your computer hardware, software (including your License Number), and the nature of the problem you are experiencing)</li>
	<li>Participate in surveys (information we collect may include demographic information such as age, gender and number of household members)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You have the final decision on whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. However, if you do not wish to provide information needed for a transaction, you may not be able to complete it. 
</p>
<li>Information Collected and Stored Automatically. When you interact with CONNECTIFY we may maintain a record of the following types of information.</li>
<ul>

<li>The name of the file or the words you search, and the browser you use to access our website.</li>

	The information collected and stored automatically by our Site is used to measure the number of visitors to various sections of our Site and to identify system performance or for server issues. We also use this information to help us expand the coverage of our Site and to make our Site more useful. This information is not linked by us to personally identifiable information and we do not disclose this in a form that personally identifies you, except in cases where we must provide IP addresses to certain credit card processors in connection with the processing of your credit card transaction. You may want to contact your credit card provider with any questions regarding the transactional information they require. 
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to our Site from your PC or the Internet Service Provider, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to ensure its security on our system and to try to prevent unauthorized access.
