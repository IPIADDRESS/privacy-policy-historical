<h3>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Use of the Data</strong></h3>
<p>We only use your personal information to provide you the Contently services or to communicate with you about the services or the Website.</p>
<p>With respect to any documents you may choose to upload to Contently, we take the privacy and confidentiality of such documents seriously. We encrypt all documents, and permanently delete any redacted edits you make to documents. If you choose to make a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can’t protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.</p>
<p>We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.</p>
<p><strong>We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:</strong></p>

– we believe it’s needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;<br>
– we believe it’s needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;<br>
