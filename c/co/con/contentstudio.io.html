                when managing social media at scale. We use all of the information we have to
                help us provide and support our Services. Here’s how:</p>
            <h3>4.1. Provide, improve and develop Services</h3>
            <p>We are able to deliver our Services, support your usage of our products
                and introduce improvements by using this information to understand how you use and
                interact with our Services.</p>
            <p>When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like automatically
                detecting your location in order to support your ability to schedule messages in your
                own time zone.</p>
            <p>We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and
                services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting
                activities.</p>
            <h3>4.2. Communicate with you</h3>
            <p>We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about
                our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you
                contact us.</p>
            <h2>5. Information we receive from other sources</h2>
            <p>We may receive information about you if you use any of the Services we provide. We inform you when we collect any data that it may be shared internally and combined with other data collected on our Services. For example, when you connect your Facebook account to ContentStudio,
                you will be able to opt in to the data that ContentStudio is able to collect from
                Facebook on your behalf.</p>
            <p>We may also receive private information about your business profiles from the social
                network profiles you connect to ContentStudio including&nbsp;Facebook,
                LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, and Instagram.</p>
            <p>Our usage of Google data is limited to the following use cases: Accessing and storing analytics, comments and posts from your accounts on Google+, Blogger and YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>We may also access data from your Google Analytics account in real time when you authorize this from our reporting area. We also securely store access tokens from Google that allow us to publish on your behalf to Google+, Google My Business, Blogger and YouTube. These access tokens can be revoked at any time.
            </p>
            <p>On all occasions where we receive data from a platform with whom our Services integrate, you will be informed of the data that will be collected by our Services and will need to give consent to have ContentStudio receive and process your personal data from these platforms on your behalf. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>We work closely with other third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them. The information we receive is used to enhance your experience with our Services.
            </p>
            <h2>6. Information we share and disclose</h2>
            <p>We do not sell or trade your personally identiﬁable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Services, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information conﬁdential and are compliant with GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
            </p>
            <p>Non-personally identiﬁable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
            </p>
            <h3>6.1 Sharing you control</h3>
            <p>We share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a social network or third party application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business.
            </p>
            <p>When you share content via your ContentStudio account to a third-party service, keep in mind that you are controlling the flow of this content from our platform through to the third-party service.
            </p>
            <p>When you add a team member or client to your account, you may choose to share personal data with them. For example, you may choose to share a client’s social media report with a team member. By acting as data controller, ContentStudio provides you with all the tools and settings you need to be able to control the flow of data.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>Subject to your settings, we also provide certain third parties with personal data to help us offer or operate our Services.
            </p>
            <h3>6.2 Service providers and advertisers</h3>
            <p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, UK, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and websites, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics.
            </p>
            <p>We may share your private personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
            </p>
            <p>We share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.
            </p>
            <p>We may share your information with advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. &nbsp;We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to display relevant advertisements to you on third party websites. For example, if we’ve noticed that you’ve been actively using our reporting features, we may use this data to show you relevant advertisements on Facebook informing you of a new analytics feature we’ve launched.
            </p>
            <h3>6.3 Affiliates and change of ownership</h3>
            <p>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity.
            </p>
            <p>We may also disclose personal data about you to our affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates’ services. This information is limited to your email address, browsing behavior and any other actions you’ve taken on our website before becoming a customer.
            </p>
            <h2>7. Where we store and transfer your personal data</h2>
            <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by employees or contractors operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, processing your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
            </p>
            <p>We take the protection of your data very seriously and have made every effort to be compliant with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>&nbsp;(GDPR) which is a “regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy
                for all individuals within the European Union and the EEA region.” The GDPR replaces the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive">1995 Data Protection Directive</a>. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers located in the US and certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using TLS technology and processed via our payment gateway, FastSpring. We do not store any credit cards in our system. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone. We also provide additional security controls within ContentStudio, allowing you to restrict access to specific IP addresses.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information on the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to request a list of
                sub-processors we use, you can do so via the following form:

            <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
            <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access, rectify, port and erase your personal data.</p>

            <h3>8.1 Accessing or Rectifying Your Personal Data</h3>
            <p>If you have registered an account on ContentStudio, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal data you provided to us and associated with your account. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <h3>8.2 Deletion</h3>
            <p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our Services or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first.
            </p>
            <p>If you follow the instructions&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.contentstudio.io/article/134-how-to-delete-my-contentstudio-io-account">here</a>, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When deactivated, you will no longer be able to access your account across any of our Services. For up to 90 days after deactivation, it is still possible to restore your ContentStudio account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. The same applies to team members or client accounts you delete from within ContentStudio.
            </p>
            <p>If you require immediate deletion of your account, please&nbsp;<a href="https://contentstudio.io/contact.php">contact us using
                    this form</a>&nbsp;and allow up to 72 hours for us to action your request. &nbsp;When your
                account is deleted, we also delete all content you’ve created within your account,
                including all content created by team members and clients, and you won't be able to
                recover that information later. We will also delete any personally identifiable
                information stored in any third party applications we use to service your account.
            </p>
            <p>If you don't want to delete your account but want to
                temporarily stop using our Services, you can contact us to deactivate your account for
                a maximum of 90 days.</p>
            <h3>8.3 Object, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent</h3>
            <p>When using any of our Services that require login information, if you would like to
                withdraw consent, please&nbsp;<a href="https://contentstudio.io/contact.php">contact us</a>&nbsp;and we will deactivate your account for you.
            </p>
            <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing
                purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use
                your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party
                for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain
                boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. &nbsp;You may also opt out of ContentStudio marketing
                communications sent to you by opening any email we have sent you and clicking on the Unsubscribe link.
            </p>
            <h3>8.4 Portability</h3>
            <p>ContentStudio provides you with a facility to download the content you have
                created or data retrieved from your social media profiles through any of our
                Services. If you would like further assistance exporting your data, please
                &nbsp;<a href="https://contentstudio.io/contact.php">contact us</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>8.5 Additional Information or Assistance</h3>
            <p>Our Services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.
                &nbsp;If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. &nbsp;Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to other websites.
            </p>

            <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be at
