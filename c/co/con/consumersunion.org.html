<p> <font size="+1" face="Arial"><b>Consumers Union Privacy Policy<br> </b></font></p><p><br>Consumers 
Union does not sell, rent, or share any information provided by you via this web 
site with any third party, except as detailed below. </p><p><b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT 
AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</b><br><br>Much of the information on our site can be accessed 
without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can 
surf ConsumerUnion.org and related advocacy sites and view much of our content 
anonymously. For instance, you can access information on policy issues affecting 
consumers without giving out any personally identifiable information. <br><br>The 
information we gather on our site falls into two categories: (1) personal information 
you supply when you "take action" on a policy issue or register to receive 
email updates, etc., and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through 
our site. <br><br><b>Personally identifiable information</b><br><br>To use certain 
features on our site, we ask you to subscribe or register. When you do this, we 
will collect personally identifiable information about you such as your name, 
mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number. In addition, we may ask 
you for the same type of information when you transmit letters to decision-makers 
or corporations on a policy issue, or complete a survey. We use this information 
to complete the transaction you requested, to provide you information relevant 
to your interests or to help improve our site. <br><br><b>Aggregate information</b><br><br>When 
you use our site, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, 
the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service 
provider, and pages visited on the site. None of this information identifies you 
personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity. For example, 
we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site, or which pages 
or features get the most attention. We use this information to make the site more 
useful to you. </p><p>We use "cookies" to store and sometimes to track 
user information. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us e-mail address or other 
personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information 
to us by, for example, taking action on one of our advocacy campaigns and agreeing 
to be part of our advocacy network or subscribing to our site. A cookie is a small 
amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our site 
to recognize your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your 
user name and password (if you are a subscriber) so you don't have to re-enter 
that information each time you visit our site. The "help" function on 
most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before 
accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept 
cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various features on our site that 
are available to other visitors<br><br><b>HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED</b><br><br>ConsumerUnion.org 
and related advocacy web sites use personally identifiable information in a limited 
number of ways. We use the information to provide you with news and action alerts 
based on the interests you have expressed by taking action on an advocacy campaign 
through our web site or through an online form that you have filled out. We also 
use the information you provide to send you e-mail on Consumers Union advocacy 
issues, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p><p><b>Sharing 
your personally identifiable information</b><br><br>In some instances, we use 
third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you, like 
an e-mail delivery service that sends out our e-mails and e-newsletters. In those 
instances we need to share your information with them. We require that those companies 
use the information only to deliver the product or service. </p><p>We may occasionally 
release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a 
court order or subpoena. <br> <br><b>HOW YOU CAN CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</b><br><br>Consumers 
Union believes in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personal 
information that you have provided to us. To update your information you have 
provided if you took action on one of our advocacy campaigns through our web site, 
follow the links on the Take Action Center to update your information. For Consumers 
Union's FinancialPrivacyNow.org, you can access your profile and update your contact 
information and user preferences at <a href="http://cu.convio.net/site/UserLogin">http://cu.convio.net/site/UserLogin</a>. 
</p><p><b>OUR E-MAIL POLICIES</b><br><br>Account and services related e-mail: 
If you have taken action on a policy issue, we will send you e-mails relating 
to your account. For example, these include confirmations that the email you sent 
through our web site has been delivered.</p><p>E-mail newsletters and action alerts: 
You may request updates or news about Consumers Union's activities, which will 
be sent to the email account you identified. To unsubscribe from the What's Hot 
email list, go to <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/aboutcu/whats-hot/hot.htm">http://www.consumersunion.org/aboutcu/whats-hot/hot.htm</a>. 
To unsubscribe from the Consumer Online email list, go to <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/maxmail/index.php">http://www.consumersunion.org/maxmail/index.php</a>. 
If you have taken action on a policy issue, we may send you e-mail about other 
policy issues that may be of interest to you. You can choose not to receive additional 
types of messages in the future by following the 'unsubscribe' instructions located 
near the bottom of each e-mail.</p><p>HTML verification: When receiving an e-mail 
from CU, we may place a one-pixel gif in that e-mail to understand whether or 
not you can accept HTML images and, if you can accept HTML, whether or not you 
viewed the e-mail. This process does not leave any information on your computer, 
nor does it collect information from your computer. Consumers Union does not share 
or sell this information with others, and we only use it to improve our e-mail 
communications with you.</p><p><b>HOW TO CONTACT US</b><br><br>If you have any
