	<span class="headline"><b>Connexion Privacy Policy</b></span><br>
	<p>Connexion does not send SPAM or sell or rent email addresses!</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>About the Information We Collect</b></span><br>
	<p>Connexion is an social network that connects you to people through
	networks of your friends.  You create a profile which is then 
	linked to your friends to create your network. To do this we display certain
	information to people within the network such as your first name, age and any optional
	information you provide about yourself. Your email address is not shared with anyone
	unless you are asking them to connect to you as a friend. Your date of birth 
	is not shared with anyone except your immediate friends (and then only if you give permission),
	though your age is always shared.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Information Collected by Connexion</b></span><br>
	<p>Connexion asks for certain information such as your name, email address, gender 
	and date of birth.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Information Obtained from Your Computer</b></span><br>
	<p>Connexion also collects the type and version number of your browser as well
	as your computer's IP address. We use this for general administration of the website - including
	for tracking down fake or libelous accounts.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Sharing of Your Information</b></span><br>
	<p>We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless
	required by law.  At Connexion's discretion, information may also be released on any fake or
	libelous account to anyone wishing to pursue legal action.</p>
	<p>Anonymized data may be shared for purposes of conducting scholarly studies, but no personal
	information (names, email addresses, etc.) will be released.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>How We Use Your Information</b></span><br>
	<p>We use your information principally to enhance your experience using the web site. Links
	available on the home page and elsewhere may be shown because they have relevance to you.
	Also to minimize irrelevant communications from us to you, any email communication from
	Connexion will be sent only to those members to whom it might be important.</p>
	
	<p>It is also used is aggregated form (i.e. as statistics like 12% of members are under the age of 20)
	and in that form may be widely distributed.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Use of Cookies</b></span><br>
	<p>Cookies are used to maintain your session with Connexion.  So if you do not have cookies enabled,
	at least for Connexion, you will not be able to use the site.</p>
	<p>We also use cookies to store information such as your email address so that you can log on automatically.  
	You activate this feature when you join or log on by asking the computer to remember your email address and password.
	To prevent someone from logging on as you, you should use this option ONLY on a computer where you will be the only
	person with access.</p>
	<p>There is also an option to have just your email address remembered.  This is a good way to simplify
	log on on a shared computer without compromising your account security.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Security</b></span><br>
	<p>Your membership information is protected by a password. This prevents unauthorized
	access to your membership information. If you feel your password has been compromised, use
	the "Account Settings" section of the site to change it.</p>
	<p>You can use the Access History page in "Account Settings" to see if any unauthorized accesses have occurred.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Email from Connexion</b></span><br>
	<p>From time to time we may send email with information about changes and 
	improvements to the site, other information that relates to your membership
	or general news. You can control whether this information is sent to you
	using the features in the "Account Settings" section of the site.</p>
	
	<p>We <b>never</b> send attachments with any email.  If you get an attachment on an email purporting
	to originate from Connexion, do not open it since it is likely to be a virus!</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Messages on Connexion</b></span><br>
	<p>The messages you send on Connexion are private.  They are not normally read by anyone
	on staff.  However, in the event that some message you send generates a complaint from
	another member for harassment or other violation of the terms of service, those messages
	that you have sent to that member may be reviewed by a member of staff to see if an actual
	violation has occurred.</p>
	
	<span class="headline"><b>Contacting Us</b></span><br>
	<p>A list of contacts for Connexion can be obtained
	<a href="contactus.cfm">here</a>.
