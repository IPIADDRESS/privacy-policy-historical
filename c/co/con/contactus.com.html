<p> 
  ContactUs.com is a suite of online contact management solutions for  small business websites (“ContactUs.com” or “Services”). Your privacy and  protection of information you share with us while using our Services is very  important to us.</p>
<p>This "Privacy Policy" explains what information we gather  from our users and how we use it. By using or accessing our Services, you are  accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. (Capitalized terms  not defined herein have the meaning set forth in our <a href="http://www.contactus.com/terms-of-service.php">Terms of Service</a>). ContactUs.com  is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Consistent with the Federal  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), we will never  knowingly gather or use personally identifiable information from anyone under  the age of 13, and we do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to register on ContactUs.com.</p>
<h3>What information does ContactUs.com  gather?</h3><p>
  ContactUs.com gathers and stores three types of information about  users that are subject to our Privacy Policy:</p>
<p><u>Information users provide to us:</u><br>
  Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). These are  voluntary submissions made when creating an account on ContactUs.com or through  your use of the Services, such as name and email address provided during registration  and form submissions, or payment information provided during purchases. Please  understand that when you sign into ContactUs.com or post or upload any content,  your information is not anonymous to us.</p>
<p><u>Information we collect when users interact with ContactUs.com: </u><br>
  Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII"). We keep  track of user interactions with our Services, such as visiting a web page,  clicking a button, and choosing a form. Also, when users access our Services,  we may collect information about their access method (such as hardware and  software attributes), location, IP address, and pages they visit. In addition,  we store certain information from their browser using “cookies”. (For more on  cookies, please see the section "What are cookies?")</p>
<p>NPII data may collected by us and our partners, and is used for the  purpose of improving the quality and relevancy of the advertisements served by us  and our partners (referred to as "Retargeting"). Such NPII data is  completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the date and time  of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser's or Partner's  websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be  traced back to a specific individual.</p>
<p><u>Information we receive from third parties: </u><br>
  We do not own or operate any third-party services offered that you  may use or interact with through our Services (collectively, “Third Party  Services”). Whenever you visit, use or interact with a Third Party Service, we  may receive information from them, including information about actions you take  and Content you post on that service. </p>
<h3>Why does ContactUs.com  gather information about me?</h3><p>
  ContactUs.com collects information in order to improve the content  and quality of our Services and to provide a customized experience tailored to  your needs. Any personally identifiable information we collect (including email  addresses, physical addresses or phone numbers) is not shared with or sold to  other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or  services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under special  circumstances outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>What are cookies?</h3><p>
  ContactUs.com may place a text file called a "cookie" in  the browser files of your computer. These cookies help us make ContactUs.com  easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and ContactUs.com.  For example, a cookie may be used to store or "remember" your Member  login information (but not your password) so that you are not required to  manually log into the site at every visit. You can remove or block cookies  using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability  to use some of our Services.</p>
<p>Our advertisers and partners may also set cookies through our  Services. For more information, please see the section "What about third  party advertisers and links?"</p>
<h3>What about third party  advertisers and links?</h3><p>
  In the course of serving advertisements on ContactUs.com, a  third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  Additionally, some links from ContactUs.com may lead to websites operated by  other companies. While these websites and advertisements may be co-branded with  our name or logo, they are not operated or maintained by us. We do not control  these cookies and users of ContactUs.com Services should check the privacy  policy of the relevant advertiser to understand whether and how it uses  cookies. ContactUs.com is not responsible for websites operated by third  parties that are linked to by any of our sites.</p>
<h3>How secure is my  information?</h3><p>
  ContactUs.com uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and  procedural measures to safeguard any information in our possession against  loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. We limit access  to personal information about you to employees whom we believe reasonably need  that information to provide support, products, or services to you or to fulfill  their roles within our organization.</p>
<p>Although we have established and maintain security procedures to  protect your personally identifiable information, please be aware that no  security measures are perfect or impenetrable. You can reduce the risk of  unauthorized access to your information by using common sense security  practices such as choosing a h3 password, using different passwords for  different services, and using up-to-date antivirus software.</p>
<p>Please report any security violations to us on this automated form.</p>
<h3>What control do I have  over my information?</h3><p>
  As a registered Member, you may modify or update your personal  account information at any time by logging into your account. Should you desire  to do so, you may also delete and close your ContactUs.com account at any time  by contacting our support team. Note that removed or deleted information may  persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h3>How is information shared?</h3><p>
  ContactUs.com will not share your personally identifiable  information with others except as described herein and in limited circumstances  where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Services,  legally required, or permitted by you. For example, we may provide information  to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically,  we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the  Services at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about  the Services, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process  payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links  (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business  operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information  for use for a limited time.</p>
<p>Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal  information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections  limiting the use of that information to the ContactUs.com-specified purposes.  We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of ContactUs.com  (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose  personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is  necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena,  search warrant or other legal process received by ContactUs.com, whether or not  a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the ContactUs.com  <a href="http://www.contactus.com/terms-of-service.php">Terms of Service</a> or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety or  rights of members of the public or users of the Services. ContactUs.com  reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest  that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of ContactUs.com  or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. We may also  transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or  dissolution.</p>
<h3>How am I notified of  changes to this Privacy Policy</h3><p>
  We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures  outlined in our <a href="http://www.contactus.com/terms-of-service.php">Terms of Service</a>. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy  Policy applies to all information we have about you and your account. If we  make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here.</p>
<h3>Who can I contact about  this Privacy Policy?</h3><p>
  To submit an inquiry about our Privacy Policy, please contact our  support department.</p>
