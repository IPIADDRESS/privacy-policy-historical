If you find that the information on your personal account is not accurate, complete or updated, than you must make all necessary changes to correct it.

        <h2>
            Data retention
        </h2>
        <p>
            We retain different types of personally identifiable information for different periods, depending on the purposes for processing the information and our legitimate business purposes. When we no longer need to process the information that identifies you, we may take measures to de-identify the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, as long as you are a user of the Service, we do not delete information related to you, unless there are technical reasons that require us to retain only portions of the data, or if we are required by law to delete it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that we will retain and disclose information when we deem it necessary to satisfy orders issued by courts and government authorities.

In any case, we may keep any aggregated or anonymous information for statistical, development, marketing and other purposes, indefinitely.
        </p>

            Transfer of data outside your territory
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Service, by its nature as an online service, may store and process information and content (including through Cloud Services) in Europe, the United States and in other various locations throughout the globe.

        </h2>
        <p>
            We and third parties on our behalf implement security measures to secure the information we store and process. While such security measures reduce the risk of security breaches, they do not provide absolute security. Therefore, while we take reasonable measures to secure the information, we cannot guarantee that it will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or unauthorized access.

        </p>
        <p>
            We strongly encourage parents to monitor their children's use of online and mobile applications. We will delete a childâ€™s personally identifiable information if a parent so requests by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@connatix.com">contact@connatix.com</a>

        <p>
            From time to time, we may change and update the terms of this Policy. Technical changes in the Service, new features and evolvement of relevant legal aspects, will require us to adapt this Policy.

        <p>
            We will notify you, either through the Service, or through any other means, in our discretion, of any substantial change that we make to this Policy. The changes will apply to you seven (7) days following transmission of the display of the notice to you. You agree to be bound by all changes made in the terms of this Policy.
