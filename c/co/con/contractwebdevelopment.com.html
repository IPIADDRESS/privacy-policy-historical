To contact Cover Story Media, Inc., please visit the <a href="http://www.coverstorymedia.com/contact-us/">Contact</a> page. <strong>We value your privacy.

<h2>What information is collected on this Site?</h2>
<p>In order to provide our users with certain products or services on our Site,&nbsp;Cover Story Media<sup>®</sup>, Inc. and its affiliates may collect different types of information. In particular, we occasionally may need to collect certain types of personal information in order to provide our users with particular features, services or offers. “Personal Information” as used herein means information that identifies a person or allows a person to be located. Examples of Personal Information include a first and last name, a home address, or an email address. The following is a summary of the kinds of information we collect at the Site from our users, and how we collect that information:</p>
<h3>Passive Collection</h3>
<p>Our software automatically collects certain information from a user’s computer when that user logs on or moves about our Site. We do not link this information to any other Personal Information the user tells us; we only use it to get a broad picture of who is on our Site and which areas our users are visiting. This information tells us what’s important to our users and what isn’t, allows us to make our Site more interesting and useful, and enhances security and efficiency on our Site. The two main ways in which we collect this general information are through:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><strong>Log Files</strong> – log files are records of user activity collected to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements, and gather broad types of information for aggregate use. The kinds of general information we collect in the log files include:
<ul class="bullets">

<li>Time of day users visit our Site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> – Cover Story Media, Inc. also uses “cookies” to gauge how users interact with our Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies cannot execute code or deliver a virus to a computer. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personal information, it merely helps the Site to be more efficient. Typically, a cookie enables a user’s computer to load Web site files faster on subsequent visits. We may also use cookies to track a user’s path for security purposes, as well as to target a user’s interests in an effort to enhance the user’s experience on our Site. If a user wishes to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, the user may refer to browser instructions to learn about these functions. If a user rejects a cookie, the user may still use our Site, however, the user may be limited in the use of certain areas. For example, if the user disables cookies the <strong>font sizing</strong> feature will not work properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Active Collection</h3>
<p>At several places on our Site, we collect certain information that users voluntarily provide to us which may contain Personal Information. Here is a brief summary of some of the areas on our Site where users may be asked to provide Personal Information:</p>
<ul class="bullets">

As part of the registration process we may ask users for a username, password, or other personal information in order to verify the user’s identity, establish the account, promote security, and enable access to various online features. We may also ask users to complete a survey as part of the registration process to find out more about who is using our Site (see more on surveys below).</li>
<li><strong>Product Updates and Other Communications</strong> – we may collect information whenever a user communicates with us or asks to receive more information about&nbsp;Cover Story Media<sup>®</sup>, Inc. or Cover Story Media, Inc. products, services and events (for example, if a user sends us email or signs up to receive notification of product updates or new product releases).
