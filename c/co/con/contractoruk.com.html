<p>We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information requested.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of the site.</p>

<b>Security</b>
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p> 
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web.</p>  
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:service@sift.co.uk">service@sift.co.uk</a></p>

<b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information</b>
<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your postcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the <a href="/profile">personal profile page</a> or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:service@sift.co.uk">service@sift.co.uk</a></p>  

<b>Notification of Changes</b>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p> 

<p>If you register as a user of the website you will be asked for some basic information. Please note that registration is not required for all areas of the website, however we do encourage you to register in order to gain full access to the website content/information and online services. There are technological and operational security systems in place that provide protection for personally identifiable information from loss or misuse.</p>

<p>Where links are provided to other websites it should be noted that they are not and cannot be governed by our Privacy Statement. We cannot guarantee your privacy when you access other websites through any link provided on this website.</p>
