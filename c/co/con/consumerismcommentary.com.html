<p><strong>QuinStreet, Inc.</strong> is concerned about privacy issues and wants  you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with  information that we collect through this website owned and controlled by  us which display or link to this Privacy Policy (the <strong>“Site”</strong>). By using our Sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy</p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information that identifies you as an individual, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Postal address</li>
<li>Telephone number</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Credit or debit card number</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, we may collect information, such as your age, weight,  health conditions, insurance type, and whether you’re a non-smoker,  combined with your Personal Information. We will treat all such  information as Personal Information as long as it is combined with  Personal Information.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information when you interact with us on the  Site. We may associate Personal Information you provide through the Site  with Personal Information collected from other sources. We will use the  combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as long as  it is combined.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We may use Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you request, to connect you with vendors who will provide you with information about products and services.</li>
<li>When you’ve submitted your Personal Information to us, which  submission you understand and agree to constitute making an “inquiry” to  us and our affiliated entities, to contact you or allow our vendors to  contact you via telephone for a limited period even if the telephone  number you submitted appears on any state and/or federal Do Not Call  list, because your inquiry serves as an exception to state and/or  federal Do Not Call laws.</li>
<li>to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you newsletters.</li>
<li>to send you important information regarding the Site, changes to our  terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative  information.</li>
<li>to send you surveys and marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>to personalize your experience on the Site and our other websites by  presenting advertising, products and offers tailored to you.</li>
<li>to allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar  promotions and to administer these activities. Some of these activities  have additional rules, which could contain additional information about  how we use and disclose your Personal Information, so we suggest that  you read these rules carefully.</li>
<li>to allow you to send messages to a friend through the Site. By using  this functionality, you are telling us that you are entitled to use and  provide us with your friend’s name and email address.</li>
<li>for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing  new products, enhancing our website, improving our services,  identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our  promotional campaigns.</li>
<li>if you purchase a product or service from us, to complete and  fulfill your purchase, for example, to have your payments processed,  communicate with you regarding your purchase and provide you with  related customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Personal Information is Disclosed</strong></p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed:</p>
<ul>
<li>to our affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  QuinStreet, Inc. is the party responsible for the management of the  jointly-used Personal Information.</li>
<li>to our third party service providers who provide services such as  contact information verification, payment processing, order fulfillment,  customer service, website hosting, data analysis, infrastructure  provision, IT services, email delivery services, auditing services and  other similar services to enable them to provide services.</li>
<li>if you request information from vendors so that they (or so that  third parties who provide similar services) can provide you with  information about their products and services. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR  LIABLE FOR VENDORS’ USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</li>
<li>if you choose to download a white paper, eBook, or other resource,  to our clients, partners and current and future sponsors of that  resource. If you do not want to be contacted by these third parties,  please do not download, view or otherwise access the white papers,  eBooks and other resources.</li>
<li>if you post your resume on the Site and elect to permit it to be  searched by potential employers and staffing agencies, to these  potential employers and staffing agencies. We do not control the use and  disclosure of Personal Information by these potential employers and  staffing agencies. While it is our goal that only employers or staffing  agencies will gain access to Personal Information in resumes, we cannot  guarantee that no other persons or entities will gain such access. WE  ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OR DISCLOSURE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONAL  INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR RESUME.</li>
<li>to third party sponsors of sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions.</li>
<li>if you choose to send messages through the Site, to identify you as  the sender to the recipient indicated by you. We will ask you for such  recipient’s name and email address and we store both email addresses for  the purpose of sending such message.</li>
<li>by you, on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other  services to which you are able to post information and materials.

<p><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Non-Personal Information”</strong> is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Collect Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal  Information from you, including your MAC address, your computer type,  screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, as well as demographic  data, for example, your location, educational degree, balance on  mortgage, value of real estate, income, age, weight, type of insurance,  diabetic or smoking-related statistics. We also aggregate Personal  Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally  identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using  Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a  particular telephone area code. We also collect Non-Personal  Information through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or  other similar technologies for example to help identify you and maintain  your signed-in status or to measure the effectiveness of e-mail  communications. We may link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,  there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline  the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.<br>
<strong><br>
How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we  may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. In some  instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal  Information (such as combining your name with your geographical  location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal  Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal  Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>
<p>Your “<strong>IP Address</strong>” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p><strong>How We Log IP Addresses </strong></p>
<p>An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server  log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the  visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is  standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web  sites.</p>
