<p><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Non-Personal Information”</strong> is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Collect Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, as well as demographic data, for example, your location, educational degree, balance on mortgage, value of real estate, income, age, weight, type of insurance, diabetic or smoking-related statistics. We also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. We also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or other similar technologies for example to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status or to measure the effectiveness of e-mail communications. We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.<br>
<strong><br>
How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p><strong>IP ADDRESSES</strong></p>
<p>Your “<strong>IP Address</strong>” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p><strong>How We Log IP Addresses </strong></p>
<p>An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses? </strong></p>
<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.</p>

</ul>
<ul>

Please note that if you opt-out of such sharing, we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from the databases of third parties with which we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related e-mails from these third parties, please contact them directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms in their privacy policies or marketing-related e-mails.</li>

<p>In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information.
