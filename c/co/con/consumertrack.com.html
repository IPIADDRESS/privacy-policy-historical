				ConsumerTrack takes privacy very seriously and we will never compromise the privacy of our customers. In order to be an effective intermediary we do need to collect certain contact and financial information. We require the submission of certain information to ensure an effective match within our network of lending professionals. We require consumers to provide us with their name, contact information, financial information and specifics regarding their property and existing loans. 
<p>
We are committed to using state of-the-art technology in order to protect the consumer's information. ConsumerTrack does not distribute nor sell any personal information we gather about consumers to any individuals or entities under any circumstances, unless we are authorized to do so. Information we do share is only within our network of partners and clients. To the extent permitted by law, we may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ConsumerTrack, our employees, affiliates, and users. We reserve the right to share information with anyone outside of our network if we are mandated to do so by law or court order. 
</p><p>
ConsumerTrack may share demographic data with our clients and other third parties for market research and demographic purposes. This information is always anonymous and does not include personal identifying information. ConsumerTrack may notify consumers about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. We do not reveal the consumer's name, address or any other identifying information to that promotional partner unless you request us to do so. You have the option to decline such offers and be removed from e-mail promotion lists at any time. To make this request, please email info@consumertrack.com. 
</p><p>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

CHANGE OF TERMS OF USE<br>
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms of Use at any time. Please check these terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any changes will mean you accept those changes.
