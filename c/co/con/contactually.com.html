            <h2 class="medium">While we recommend that you read this policy in its entirety, here are a few points that may answer common questions about using the Contactually Services and Site:</h2>
          </div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Contactually does not access your contacts for marketing purposes. We also do not sell, give, or trade your contacts to other companies.</li>
            <li>Some Contactually services are provided in partnership with a third-party. If the third-party is allowed to retain and reuse the information that Contactually sends on your behalf (for example, in contact signature scraping), you may choose
              whether to use those services by adjusting your Contactually settings. If you do not participate in the service, Contactually will not send data to the service provider on your behalf.</li>
            <li>Your contacts and activity history are not shared with other Contactually users. One exception may be sharing within your own company/team, based on your settings. If you do not know if your account has been set up to share contacts with others
              in your company, please ask your team administrator or trainer, or reach out to our Support team at <a href="mailto:support@contactually.com">support@contactually.com</a> for assistance.</li>
            <li>Contactually processes the content of the contact communications (e.g. emails, text messages, etc.) to which you have provided us access only to enhance our services for you. Contactually does not market to you or your contacts based on the
              content of your communications, and we do not share that content.</li>
            <li>Contactually does not delete or modify your contacts without your permission; we also do not delete or modify your emails, or send emails to your contacts on your behalf, without your permission.</li>
            <li>You may revoke Contactually’s access to your email account, mobile phone history, and other sources of contacts and activity history at any time; however, revoking access may limit the ability of Contactually to provide services to you.</li>
            <li>Contactually may track your usage of the platform for the purposes of support, research, product development, or marketing. There are a variety of ways to opt-out of targeted marketing, which are detailed further in this policy.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Our Services enables you to strengthen, track and leverage your contacts and communications with your contacts by using a variety of automated and machine-learning methods to analyze information you have authorized the Services to access (“Content”)
          in your mobile device, email accounts, and in other online, cloud or mobile services (“Authorized Sources”). This means that Contactually will have access to, and will analyze, among other things, your full emails, contact lists and other materials.
          All analysis will be conducted consistent with this Privacy Policy, which you should review carefully.</p>

        <h2 class="large">Our Policy</h2>

          Sources”) where our Customers have authorized the Services to access such Authorized Sources. using the Services and providing us with access to Authorized Sources, Customers warrant they have the right to provide us with access to each Authorized
          Sources, as well as to the personal information and Content contained therein.</p>

          to improve the content and operation of the Services, to determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users and to undertake research and analysis. We also use this technical information to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers
          into the Services.</p>

        <h3 class="medium">4. Information We Collect From Other Sources</h3>
        <p>We may also collect information from other companies or third parties or from various service providers to supplement the personal information and Content provided by our Customers to help us maintain the accuracy of personal information and

<div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h2 class="large">How Do We Use Cookies?</h2>

        <p>Cookies, web beacons and clear gifs are methods used to uniquely identify the device you are using to interact with the Services. We use these technologies to recognize you, optimize the Services for you and to gather information about how users

        <h2 class="large">How Does Contactually Use Information?</h2>

        <div class="ui compact message no-background">
          <div class="header">
            <h3 class="medium">We will use your personal information for the following purposes:</h3>
          </div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>To confirm your identity,</li>
            <li>To complete transactions,</li>
            <li>To provide, operate and maintain the Services,</li>
            <li>To operate our business, including internal business intelligence purposes, to conduct research, product

          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h2 class="large">Aggregating and Sharing Combined Information From Many Users</h2>

        <p>At no time would we aggregate and share information with other users in a manner that would allow you or any other person to be identified.</p>

        <p>However, we may prepare and share information about our Customers with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for research, academic, marketing and/or promotional purposes. For example, we may share demographic data that describes the
          percentage of our Customers who use mobile services or who use a particular operating system. We or our third party partners may publicly report the aggregated findings of the research or analysis, but only in a way that would not allow you or any
          other person to be identified.</p>


<div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h2 class="large">Will Contactually Disclose The Information It Collects To Outside Parties?</h2>

        <div class="ui compact message no-background">
          <div class="header">
            In addition to the Aggregating and Sharing Combined Information section, above, Contactually may disclose personal information and Content we collect with the parties below for the purposes set out in this policy:
          </div>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>A member of our group or our affiliates,</li>
            <li>Our professional advisors such as auditors, accountants and lawyers, etc., and</li>
            <li>Companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and payment processing.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>We may also disclose personal information and Content if required to do so by law or in good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our
          rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our Service; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of our Services or the public.</p>

        <p>As Contactually continues to develop its business, we might sell or buy lines of business or assets. If all or substantially all of Contactually’s business (or a line of Contactually’s business) or assets (or the assets of a line of Contactually’s
          business) are acquired by a third party, personal information will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party. If so,
          you will be provided advance notice of the impending change of control, so that you may have the opportunity to terminate your access to the Service, if necessary.</p>

        <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit
          them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

        <p>Where personal information relating to European-based individuals is shared with a third party located in a non-EU country that has not received an adequacy decision by the European Commission, we rely on appropriate safeguards, such as the
          European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses and EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, to transfer the data.</p>


<div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h2 class="large">Access To Your Authorized Services And CRM.</h2>

        <p>The primary function of the Services is to receive Access to your Content through your Authorized Services and sync that information to your designated CRM. To do this we must access your Authorized Services with the login information you use to
          access them. We will request your user name, password, and any other login data that you have set up with your Authorized Sources to enable access. We use this information to update and maintain your Content and to enhance the Services over time.</p>

        <p>We also work with other companies or developers to optimize the Services and you may choose to sync, link or connect other third party services, over time. Sometimes we may let you know about another service or product, or another company may let

          malware on our Site or as part of the Services. Except to the extent due to our gross negligence or willful misconduct, we expressly disclaim, and you release us from any liability associated with any technical issues caused by the Services,

        <p>Other companies or organizations may have links to their websites in our Services. We are not responsible for how these other companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that you provide them. If you choose to
          access a third party website through a link provided as part of our Services, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party website. Similarly, we use third party-provided
          APIs and other tools to receive information from accounts to which you give us access (e.g., your email account(s) and your CRM platform). We are not responsible for errors or other issues associated with the functionality of such APIs and other
          tools.</p>

<div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h2 class="large">Collection Of Information From Children</h2>

<div class="ui divider"></div>
        <h2 class="large">Consent To Processing In The United States.</h2>

          United States, we use servers provided by Heroku, a cloud application platform based in the United States, and we have support teams located in the Philippines).</p>

        <p>By providing any personal information and/or Content to Contactually, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada and the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to
          the transfer of such personal information across international borders in accordance with Contactually’s standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America and the Philippines or
          other countries in which our employees and contractors may be located.</p>

        <h2 class="large">How Long Do We Retain Information?</h2>

        <h3 class="medium">Information Customers Provide To Us</h3>
        <p>We will store your personal information, in a form which permits us to identify you for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services. We will retain personal information for a period of 12 months after your account is
          closed, unless you instruct us to delete the personal information. We will retain and use your personal information after this period as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

        <h3 class="medium">Information Processed On Behalf Of Customers</h3>

        <h2 class="large">Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

        <p>As stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure — typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is
          participating in some activity described in our Services. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific activity, as we do not share
          information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information as part of the Services. Please
          note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need
          to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
        </p>

Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required
