<p>ContextWeb respects the privacy of individuals that use the Company's services either directly or indirectly through our partners. ContextWeb does not collect any individually identifiable information about its users. ContextWeb does not share any information collected on the aggregate level with any third party. </p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br> 
ContextWeb does not use cookies, nor does it send cookies to your desktop.  A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user.</p> 

<p><strong>User Information</strong><br> 
ContextWeb does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.  ContextWeb collects information such as time of day, URL visited, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users, such as showing contextually relevant ads based on the URL visited. </p>

<p><strong>URL Content</strong><br>
ContextWeb spiders and looks at publicly available web pages only. All secure pages that require user logins are not spidered by ContextWeb. ContextWeb may use form data posted in URL, such as search query terms, in order to improve its service to the users. The URL content is fetched from the ContextWeb servers. Only the URL is sent to ContextWeb servers from the desktop. </p>

<p><strong>Advertising Content</strong><br>
ContextWeb's services display links to other sites in the form of "Contextual Advertising." ContextWeb has no control over the content presented in those advertisements; third party partners provide them. The content of these advertisements are intended show a high degree of relevance to the content you view. ContextWeb parses the content of the URL visited, determines the relevant context and keywords and passes this information to the third party partnerships to obtain the advertisements to display. </p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong><br>
ContextWeb may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average ContextWeb user visits a particular URL, or which contextual advertisements are popular with our users. Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. </p>

<p><strong>Your Consent and Changes to the Privacy Policy </strong><br>
By using our services directly or indirectly, you consent to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this policy. ContextWeb may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. </p>
