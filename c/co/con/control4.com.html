We respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting the personal information that you share with us. This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Control4 with respect to our products, services and websites (including <a href="http://www.control4.com">www.control4.com</a>, <a href="http://my.control4.com">my.control4.com</a>, <a href="http://customer.control4.com">customer.control4.com</a>&nbsp;or other websites, online services, or applications operated or controlled by Control4, collectively the "Sites"). We outline the types of information Control4 collects, how we collect it, how we use it, and the options you have to restrict the collection and use of your personally identifiable information.</p><p>By using Control4's products, services or Sites you signify your acceptance of Control4’s collection and use of your personal information in the manner and for the purposes described herein. If you do not agree to some aspect of Control4’s intended use of your information, you may use one or more of the methods described in this Privacy Policy to opt out of the specific type of collection or use of information. If you feel that these methods are insufficient to alleviate your concerns, please do not use our products, services, or Sites or otherwise provide Control4 with your personal information.</p><h3>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3><p>Control4 may collect information about you any time you are in contact with Control4, its products, services or Sites. Control4 may share this personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates (and vice versa) but only for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><h3>Information You Provide</h3><p>We may ask you to provide personal information when you visit our Sites, use our products, register for a program or service, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available to you from time to time. We may ask you for: your name, title or position, email address, mailing address, phone number, financial information, and other personal information as appropriate. Additionally, we may request information about the Control4 products you use, or third-party products connected to your Control4 system, such as model or serial numbers. In the case of a technical issue, we may also collect information relating to a support or service incident. Please note that we do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal information relating to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality; please do provide any of this type of information to us.</p><h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3><p>To measure and improve the performance of our Sites, we may collect information during your visit to the Sites through our automatic data collection tools, which may include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, pixel tags and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools help us track how users are interacting with our Sites, and help us make your visit to our Sites easier and more efficient by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. Control4 maintains its own pages on many social networking sites, and we may also collect information from you when you interact with our social networking pages.</p><h3>Use of Cookies and Other Web Tracking Technologies</h3><p>A "cookie" is a small piece of data stored on a user's device. When you visit the Sites, Control4 may place a "cookie" on your device which allows us to compile information about Sites usage and to recognize you when you visit the Sites again. In addition, we use pixel tags "tiny graphic images " to tell us what parts of our Sites our users have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches performed on our Sites. This information can be used to enhance the content of the Sites and make your experience more informative. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that users can read and tell us whether emails have been opened to help assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our users. If you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your email address, we will associate our cookies and tags with that information and you will no longer be an anonymous visitor to the Sites.</p><p>In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Sites. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in our email messages.</p><p>Like many other companies, we use third party partners to analyze data collected about your browsing behavior when you visit our Sties. Our Sites may include technology from Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics, Quantcast, Elaqua, Hubspot and other similar technologies. These tools provide us with analytical information, reports and analysis about the use of our Sites, and may record the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, the type of device and operating system you are using, your general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our Site, such as the page that led you to our Sites, how often you visit pages within our Sites and other data related to the use of our Sites. We may also use these tools to help serve content that is relevant to you. For more information about these services and the related privacy policies and options available to you, please visit the websites of our analytics service providers listed above. If you wish to avoid Contol4’s use of these analytics services on our Sites, you may use any opt-out mechanisms provided by our analytics providers and/or actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools.</p><h3>Do Not Track Features</h3><p>Some web browsers may let you enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will update our Privacy Policy and describe to describe our response. More information about "do not track" is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>. The only way to completely opt out of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools.</p><p>Information Collected through our Products When you install our systems to help automate your house, we receive information that you or your installer inputs into your configuration project file which may include: the model and serial numbers of the Control4 products installed; the version and type of any software installed; the type of third-party devices you integrate,; the names of the rooms where you have connected devices; your zip code or time zone; and other information about your configuration.
