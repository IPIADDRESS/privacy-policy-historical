<p>Effective  Date: May 15, 2014<br>
  <br>
  We at Connect6, Inc., along with our  subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Connect6°"),  respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice describes  the types of personal information we collect about our consumers, how  we may use the information and with whom we may share it. The notice  also describes the measures we take to safeguard the personal  information. In addition, we tell you how you can ask us to (i)  access or change the personal information we maintain about you, (ii)  withdraw consent you previously provided to us, (iii) refrain from  sending you certain communications, and (iv) answer questions you may  have about our privacy practices</p>
<h3><br>
<a name="Information+We+Obtain" id="Information+We+Obtain"></a> Information  We Obtain</h3>
<p> We may  obtain personal information about Connect6° consumers and users  (such as name, contact details and payment information) in connection  with various activities such as (i) use of the Connect6° websites  and services  (ii)  publicly-available  information about people and companies captured from technology scans  of the Internet, (iii) licensed information from other companies,  (iv)  events in which we participate, and (v) promotions and other offers.</p>
<p>Connect6°  creates profiles of business people and companies, which we call  "Public Profiles," from different sources. Once Connect6°  has collected information about a person or company, Connect6°  combines multiple mentions of the same person or company into a  Public Profile. The resulting directory of Public Profiles (the  "Directory") is then made available to the users of the  website and service and Connect6°‘s  customers and strategic partners.</p>
<p>The  types of personal information we may obtain include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individual  	and business contact information (such as name, company name,  	physical address, email address, and telephone or fax number)</li>
  <li>Information  	that enables us to verify your identity</li>
  <li>Names,  	email addresses and telephone numbers of others to whom we are asked  	to send information</li>
  <li>Username  	and password to access Connect6° products and services online</li>
  <li>Social  	media handles</li>
  <li>Payment  	information (including payment card details or online payment  	services number and billing address) and financial information (such  	as bank account number)</li>
  <li>Tax  	identification number in circumstances in which you request products  	or services for which this information is required, or in connection  	with certain promotions or sweepstakes</li>
  <li>Other  	personal information that may be provided to us to obtain a  	Connect6° product or service</li>
</ul>
<p> Information  we may receive from third parties</p>
<p> When  you make information publicly available on your social networking  page, we may collect that information.</p>
<p> If  you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you  understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third  Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account  with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party  Account Information transmitted to us is covered by this policy. For  example, if you access our websites or services through a third-party  connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by  “following,” “liking,” adding the Connect6° application,  linking your account to the Connect6° services, etc., that third  party may pass certain information about your use of its service to  Connect6°. This information could include, but is not limited to,  the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook  UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any  information that you have permitted the third party to share with us  including contacts or “Friends,” and any information you have  made public in connection with that service. <br>
  <br>
In  addition, when you visit our websites or use our services, we may  collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and  web beacons. The information we collect in this manner includes IP  address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating  system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions  taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits. A "cookie"  is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other  Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser  or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web  beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF,  links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to  transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.  Through these automated collection methods, we obtain "clickstream  data," which is a log of content on which a visitor clicks while  browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a  record of the action may be collected and stored. We may link certain  data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your  browser information, with other information we have obtained about  you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we  sent to you. We also may use third-party website analytics tools that  collect information about visitor traffic on our websites. Your  browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain  types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of  cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be  able to use all of the features of our websites.</p>

  You may see certain ads on other websites because we  participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target  our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and  contextual means. These networks track your online activities over  time by collecting information through automated means, including  through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The  networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be  tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad  networks may collect includes information about your visits to  websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such  as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on  the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites  and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This  process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing  efforts. </p>
