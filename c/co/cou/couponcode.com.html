                      sites to which we link.</p>
                    <p>LDSM is committed to protecting personal information, by 
                      following responsible information handling practices in 
                      keeping with privacy laws.</p>
                    <p>LDSM uses information and communication technologies to 
                      support our LDSM activities. Our Privacy Statement covers 
                      LDSM and our website.</p>
                    <p><strong>Anonymous Access</strong></p>
                    <p>You can access our website home page and browse our site 
                      without disclosing your personal data. As a general policy, 
                      NO personal information is collected from our visitors. 
                      The only personal information captured through our Web site 
                      is the information that you volunteer such as your email 
                      address or perhaps a mailing address that will enable us 
                      to send to you requested information. We do not share any

                    <p>Safeguards are in place to ensure that the information 
                      is not disclosed or shared for any other purposes.</p>
                    <p><strong>LDSM's Use of Cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification 
                      number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive 
                      of your computer so that the web site may identify separate 
                      visitors to the site and track users' activities on the 
                      web site. A cookie will not let a web site know any personally 
                      identifiable information about you, such as your real name 
                      and address.</p>
                    <p>We collect information about you only if you volunteer 
                      it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Newsletter Subscriptions</strong></p>
                    <p>When you subscribe to a LDSM Newsletter, you need only supply 
                      an email address. This email address is used to deliver 
                      the e-mail newsletter to you. Your email is not used or 
                      known by any other newsletter subscriber, organization, 
                      Web site or government agency.</p>
                    <p><strong>Links on our Website</strong></p>
                    <p>Because LDSM wants your website experience to be informational 
                      and resourceful, our Website also provides a number of links 
                      to third party sites.</p>
                    <p>LDSM assumes no responsibility for the information practices 
                      of sites you are able to access through our site. We encourage 
                      visitors to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing 
                      any personally identifiable information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Choice</strong></p>
                    <p>We collect personal data you volunteer online, or when 
                      you make use of or register for our activities and services, 
                      in order to better meet your program, service and information 
                      needs.</p>
                    <p>We also use and disclose data, which does not identify 
                      individuals, for statistical purposes to develop and enhance 
                      LDSM activities and services.</p>
                    <p>We may also collect personal information in order to satisfy 
                      legal, government and regulatory obligations.</p>
                    <p>If you supply us with your contact information, you may 
                      hear from us about important information concerning the 
                      LDSM activity or project in which you are involved.</p>
                    <p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
                    <p>We collect personal information at the user's discretion. 
                      This information will be limited to the purpose described 
                      to the user when requesting that information. A practical 
                      example of a situation like this would be that we may request 
                      the user's name and e-mail address in order to send updates 
                      of changes to our website or mailing of specific information 
                      about our programs. We would not send invitations to events 
                      unless the user gives their permission. Similarly, we will 
                      not solicit donations using the information received from 
                      the user unless the user gives their permission. Permission 
                      will not be assumed."</p>
                    <p>We will collect information for statistical purposes for 
                      administration of the website. The stored information will 
                      not include any information that reveals any contact information 
                      of the user.</p>
                    
                  <p><strong>Confidentiality / Security</strong></p>
                    <p>LDSM maintains physical, electronic and administrative safeguards 
                      that are appropriate to the type of personal information 
                      we obtain from you.</p>
                    
                  <p>LDSM staff and volunteers having access to personal data 
                    are required to respect the confidentiality of personal information
