        founder is a staunch adversary of unsolicited e-mail, direct mail and intrusive
        telemarketing, which is one of the reasons why at&nbsp; The Couples Company &amp; via
        CouplesCompany.com we are commitment to protecting your privacy. We will never sell, rent,

        <p><strong><small><small>Information Collection and Use </small></small></strong></p>
        <p><small><small>CouplesCompany.com is a company about relationships, founded upon
        marketing principle that dictates putting our customers and their needs first. In order to
        do this we created the Sensualist’s Club, our free membership club, which entitles
        members to benefits, discounts and access to our free online classes. Questions asked are
        purely for the internal marketing, editorial creation and product planning use of
        CouplesCompany.com. Though detailed, this information allows us to decided what products
        to carry, what price ranges will suit our membership, where to look for special offers for
        our members, plus the direction of our editorial, courses and other service offerings. For
        auditing purposes, it substantiates our membership and visitor numbers. It also allows us
        to prevent children from accessing content not suited to their age. Any personal
        information collected on CouplesCompany.com is knowingly and voluntarily provided by
        customers and visitors to our site. Under no circumstance is this information ever sold,
        leased, published or rented to a third party without your expressed consent. Should
        changes be made to our privacy policy, all club member sin our database will be notified
        of the changes and given the opportunity to opt-out of their membership&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><a href="#top">TOP</a></small></p>
        <p><strong><small><small>Mergers, Acquisitions or Sale</small></small></strong></p>
        <p><small><small>In the event that Couples Company is bought, merged or acquired by a
        third party, all members of the Sensualist's Club with valid contact information will be
        notified prior to the third party taking possession of Couples Company.&nbsp; This
        notification will ask whether Sensualist's Club members prefer to remain members after the
        transfer or prefer to remove their information from the Sensualist's Club prior to the
        transfer.&nbsp; Federal law and tax requirements mandate we keep on file records relating
        to purchases for up to seven years.&nbsp; This includes online transactions initiated via
        Couples Company.&nbsp; Information contained in these documents can not be changed or
        eliminated in the event of a sale or transfer.&nbsp; However information collected for
        commerce purposes will never be used to contact a customer unless it relates to the
        transaction covered within the context of the document.&nbsp; This requirement will be a
        non-negotiable item in the event of a sale, acquisition or merger of Couples Company with
        a third party. </small><a href="#top">TOP</a></small></p>

        </strong>Users may experience CouplesCompany.com within a co-branded environment alongside
        one of our partners. These companies are strategic partners. Co-branded pages are
        recognizable by two methods. 1) By the presence of a "frame" either at the top
        the page and/or when both companies' brand logos are presented together on the page. 2) By
        a seperate browse window opening to allow access to the partners site without leavint
        Couples Company. In such situations, individual user information may be shared only
        between our two companies in an effort to better understand and meet our customers' needs.
