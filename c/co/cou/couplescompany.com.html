        <p><strong>Information Collection and Use </strong></p>
        <p><small><font size="3">CouplesCompany.com is a company about relationships, founded upon
        marketing principle that dictates putting our customers and their needs first. In order to
        do this we created the Couples Club, our free membership club, which entitles
        members to benefits, discounts and access to our free online classes. Questions asked are
        purely for the internal marketing, editorial creation and product planning use of CouplesCompany.com. Though detailed, this information allows us to decided what products
        to carry, what price ranges will suit our membership, where to look for special offers for
        our members, plus the direction of our editorial, courses and other service offerings. For
        auditing purposes, it substantiates our membership and visitor numbers. It also allows us
        to prevent children from accessing content not suited to their age. Any personal
        information collected on CouplesCompany.com is knowingly and voluntarily provided by
        customers and visitors to our site. Under no circumstance is this information ever sold,
        leased, published or rented to a third party without your expressed consent. Should
        changes be made to our privacy policy, all club members in our database will be notified
        of the changes and given the opportunity to opt-out of their membership&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </font><a href="#top"><font size="3">TOP</font></a></small></p>
        <p><strong>Mergers, Acquisitions or Sale</strong></p>
        <p><small><font size="3">In the event that Couples Company is bought, merged or acquired by a
        third party, all members of the Couples Club with valid contact information will be
        notified prior to the third party taking possession of Couples Company.&nbsp; This
        notification will ask whether Sensualist's Club members prefer to remain members after the
        transfer or prefer to remove their information from the Couples Club prior to the
        transfer.&nbsp; Federal law and tax requirements mandate we keep on file records relating
        to purchases for up to seven years.&nbsp; This includes online transactions initiated via
        Couples Company.&nbsp; Information contained in these documents can not be changed or
        eliminated in the event of a sale or transfer.&nbsp; However information collected for
        commerce purposes will never be used to contact a customer unless it relates to the
        transaction covered within the context of the document.&nbsp; This requirement will be a
        non-negotiable item in the event of a sale, acquisition or merger of Couples Company with
        a third party. </font><a href="#top"><font size="3">TOP</font></a></small></p>
        <p><strong>Third Party Collection of information on CouplesCompany.com:</strong></p>
        <p>Many of our shopping functions are outsourced. Should you choose to
        purchase from a CouplesCompany.com vendor, you will be prompted for information and given
        the opportunity to submit to that vendor individually or allow CouplesCompany.com to drop
        in your name, shipping address, and phone number from your Couples Club member file. </p>
        <p>Your address and phone number are required to ship products. Your email
        address will be used to send you two emails following a purchase, one to confirm your
        order has shipped, and the second to provide an itemized order summary with your order
        number and tracking number so that you can find the status of your order. If necessary, a
        CouplesCompany.com customer service representative may contact you by telephone to resolve
        any issues concerning your order.</p>
        <p><small><font size="3">We may occasionally run contests and other similar promotions on our
        site. These contests are open to Couples Club Members only and do not require any

        <p><small><strong><font size="3">Co-branded Relationships and Strategic Partners<br>
        </font>
        </strong><font size="3">Users may experience CouplesCompany.com within a co-branded environment alongside
        one of our partners. These companies are strategic partners. Co-branded pages are
        recognizable by two methods. 1) By the presence of a "frame" either at the top
        the page and/or when both companies' brand logos are presented together on the page. 2) By
        a separate browse window opening to allow access to the partners site without 
        leaving
        Couples Company. In such situations, individual user information may be shared only
        between our two companies in an effort to better understand and meet our customers' needs.
        An example of this would be your region of the country or zip code. Should you have
        additional privacy concerns, please also refer to the privacy policy of our partner from
        whose site you visited prior to arriving at CouplesCompany.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;
