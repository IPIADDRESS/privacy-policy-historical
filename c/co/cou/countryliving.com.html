																	    RealAge, Inc., values the privacy of all of our readers. We take very seriously the need to respect and protect your privacy and the security of any information you may share with us. We've built a site that allows you to control how much information you give us and how that information is used. This privacy policy ("Policy") describes the data collection, use, and disclosure practices of RealAge, Inc., in connection with the Web Site, <a href="http://cls.realage.com/">www.RealAge.com</a> (the "Web Site" or "Site").
                                                                        <br><br>
                                                                        This Policy applies to information collected only directly through or from the RealAge Web Site. It does not apply to personal information collected from offline resources and communications, such as information you may send to us in a postal letter or give to us in a phone call. This Policy also does not apply to third-party online resources to which RealAge Web Sites may link, because RealAge does not control their content or their privacy practices.
                                                                        <br><br>
                                                                        Please read our Policy carefully. Your understanding of how we use any information you provide --  and your trust that we will use it carefully -- are very important both to you and to us. Why? Because it helps us provide more relevant, useful information to you. If you have any questions about our data collection, use, or disclosure practices, please contact us in any of the ways listed at the end (<a href="#sec17">Section 17</a>). Please also be sure to read our complete <a href="http://cls.realage.com/corporate/termsofuse.aspx">Terms of Use</a> (this Privacy Policy is a part of it).

                                                                        <div class="MarginBottom5px">

                                                                        </div>

Certain information is necessary for us to provide one or more RealAge services to you. For a full description of these services, <a href="#sec4">see Section 4, "How We Use the Information We Collect."</a> Other information is optional; if you elect not to provide optional information, it may limit the value of what RealAge can provide for you. For example, if we do not have information on a health condition you may have -- such as high blood pressure -- we will not be able to provide information about how best to manage your diet and lifestyle to improve your health. (That includes information on medications that may help you manage a diagnosed condition like high blood pressure.) In short, the more information we have about you, the more valuable RealAge can be to you. 
                                                                        <br><br>
                                                                        We collect two types of information on RealAge. The first, "Personal Information," is information that allows someone to identify or contact you, such as your name and e-mail address, as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. The second type, "Anonymous Data," is data not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Data cannot be used to identify you. We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Data based on your participation on RealAge.
                                                                        <br><br>

																	    You can take advantage of the services offered on RealAge in two ways -- as a Registrant or as a Member. We'll explain the differences.

We call that your "Registration Information." That Registration Information is recognized by all of RealAge's Affiliates (they're <a href="#sec12">described in Section 12, "About Our Affiliates"</a>). This means you can use the same user name and password to take advantage of services offered on the Web sites of our Affiliates. Please note that if you visit an Affiliate's Web site, you will be leaving RealAge, and anything you do on those sites will be governed by the privacy policy of the Affiliate. 
                                                                        <br><br>

After you have given us your Registration Information, we will ask you if you would like to become a Member. If you say yes, we will periodically send you free health newsletters and e-mails that contain high-quality health and lifestyle information; directly promote the use of RealAge Web Sites (which include RealAge.com, DogAge.com, and CatAge.com) and the sites of our Affiliates; and may offer products or services for purchase. 
                                                                        <br><br>

We will NOT give your Personal Information to those advertisers (<a href="#sec4">see Section 4, "How We Use the Information We Collect"</a>). If you don't want us to send you free health newsletters and e-mails, you should not become a Member; you will still have access to all the other tools and services on the Site as a Registrant.
                                                                        <br><br>

As with most Web sites, we accept advertising and sponsorships as a way of keeping the articles, tools, assessments, and newsletters free to RealAge users. If you don't want to see such ads, you should not become a RealAge Member or Registrant.
                                                                        <br><br>

																        An "IP Address" is actually a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP address stays the same from session to session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider (such as Earthlink or AT&amp;T), your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our Web page flow.

																        We use single pixel GIFs (also known as action tags or web beacons) on the Site and also in HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails sent by us have been opened by recipients (including anyone to which the e-mails have been forwarded). Therefore, if you cannot see images when viewing a RealAge e-mail, we do not know if you open that particular e-mail. Similarly, if you receive your e-mail from us in text format (i.e., no pictures or graphics), we do not know if you open that particular e-mail. This information helps us assess the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns.
