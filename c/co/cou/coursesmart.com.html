We will not sell, share, rent or otherwise disclose this information to third parties outside of CourseSmart and its agents, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>CourseSmart collects information from our users at several different points on the Site, Mobile site and within the Mobile Application. We consider certain information we collect from you to be Personally Identifying Information, including, for example, your email address, name, mailing address, phone number, academic institution information, course information, and credit card billing information, and other contact information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. We also collect demographic information and tie it to your personally identifying information, such as age or date of birth, gender, and password. We collect a user’s device type, so that the API can return the right items per device. We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Application or services.</p><p>Additionally, we may collect Personally Identifying Information about you that you provide to us when you contact us or that you voluntarily post in blogs available through the Site. You should be aware that other users will be able to see any information that you post to such blogs and may use the information to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifying information you choose to submit in these blogs. To request removal of your personally identifying information from our blog, contact us <a href="mailto:support@coursesmart.com" title="support@coursesmart.com" target="_blank">support@coursesmart.com.</a> In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifying information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p><p>We also may collect the foregoing Personally Identifying Information about you from our third party affiliate or partner companies and from marketing or advertising companies that provide us with such information as a part of their relationship with us.</p><p>We will not send you marketing communications unless you have opted-in to receiving them. We may also collect information about you and your use of our Site and the CourseSmart Service through your use of our Site and the CourseSmart Service. You are able to opt-in to receiving marketing communications from CourseSmart by signing in to the account you created, or in the instance of faculty, the account that was created for you by one of our publisher affiliates, and checking the box found in the Account Preferences section.</p><p>CourseSmart uses this Personally Identifying Information to serve your needs as well as our own legitimate business purposes. We may use your Personally Identifying Information to help us improve our Site, to allow users to read their notes and make new notes within the mobile application, or for CourseSmart's marketing and promotional purposes (for example, to send email announcements of new products in the CourseSmart Service) or to track user movement and activity with regard to use of the CourseSmart Service. We may also use Personally Identifying Information to verify your authority to enter our Site, improve the content and general administration of the Site and the CourseSmart Service, provide you with notice regarding goods and services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future, provide you with notices about other users of our Site and for targeted advertising.</p><p>For student and faculty accounts that originate through a CourseSmart integration, your Personally Identifying Information and account activity may be shared back to the institution to support service improvements.</p><p>If you do not want your Personally Identifying Information shared, please opt–out by emailing <a href="mailto:opt-out@coursesmart.com" title="opt-out@coursesmart.com" target="_blank">opt-out@coursesmart.com</a> with the subject line "Unsubscribe." In the body of the email, please include your first and last name, the college or university you attend and your college email address.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Targeted Advertising</h3><p>Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's browsing behavior within our desktop website, mobile application and mobile website such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which CourseSmart advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites or mobile apps other than CourseSmart. For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while visiting Coursesmart.com or the CourseSmart app, you may be served an advertisement from CourseSmart.com or the CourseSmart app for nursing related programs when you visit a site or mobile app other than CourseSmart.com. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from CourseSmart.com, CourseSmart emails, our mobile app, or through third party website or mobile app publishers. If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from CourseSmart.com that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/" title="Click here If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from CourseSmart.com" target="_blank">click here.</a> Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from CourseSmart.com and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from CourseSmart.com; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Children's Privacy</h3><p>CourseSmart recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. CourseSmart does not target its services or the Site to children under 13. CourseSmart does not knowingly collect Personally Identifying Information from children under the age of 13.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Registration</h3><p>To use the Site, either as a trial user or a digital renter, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, you will be required to give your name and email address. The email address is used to contact you about any services on our Site in which you have expressed an interest and as otherwise described in this privacy policy.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Ordering</h3><p>When you place an order for access to a CourseSmart eTextbook or eResource, we may request information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders and as otherwise described in this privacy policy. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Cookies</h3><p>CourseSmart uses "cookies" to improve the quality of your visit to the Site or Mobile site by providing you with personalized information and features. Cookies are a software technology that enables our systems to recognize your computer or mobile devices and collect non-personally identifying information about you. This type of information includes: type of browser used to access the Internet (i.e. Netscape 6.2, Internet Explorer 4.0), type of operating system (i.e. Windows 95, Macintosh), and the domain of your Internet service provider. CourseSmart generally does not know the name, email address, phone number, or home address of anyone who visits the Site, unless that person is accessing his or her digital rental.</p><p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p><p>You can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies or to block cookies. If you block cookies, however, you will not be able to access CourseSmart eTextbooks or eResources or use certain other Site features or functions.</p><p>We use analytics within our mobile application for click through tracking and to monitor crashes so that CourseSmart knows at what point in the application it crashed. We do use this information to personally identify you.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Third Party Cookies</h3><p>The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site or Mobile site and in order for you to use the shopping cart.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3><p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifying information.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Flash LSOs</h3><p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or Mobile site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p><p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" title="Learn more about Flash cookies" target="_blank" style="display:inline-block;">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118</a></p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Aggregate Information</h3><p>We use IP addresses from our log files to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifying Information.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Sharing Information</h3><p>We may share Personally Identifiable Information to enforce CourseSmart's Terms of Service.</p><p>We may share Personally Identifying Information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information with the participating publishers and their affiliates with respect to their products that are part of the CourseSmart Service for their own use. In addition, we may share some Personally Identifying Information with affiliates of CourseSmart as well as with our business partners.</p><p>Personally Identifying Information is shared with publishers to notify a customer that a book he or she purchased has been discontinued. Information is also shared with our third party customer service support company who uses the information only for resolving customer service issues and a credit card processing company to process your payments. Only for those customers who have opted in, we share information with our third party email management company who sends CourseSmart approved marketing emails on our behalf.</p><p>When we partner with another party to provide specific services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use Personally Identifying Information except for the purpose of providing these services. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services and an email service provider to send emails to you on our behalf. These companies are not allowed to retain, share, store or use Personally Identifying Information for any secondary purposes.</p><p>We will not share, sell, rent or trade your Personally Identifying Information to any third party except as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We may transfer your Personally Identifying Information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which CourseSmart participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of CourseSmart's assets to which the Site relates. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifying information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifying information.</p><p>We may also release Personal Identifying Information when we believe that disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site or the Service, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CourseSmart, participating publishers, users, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purpose of preventing fraud, protecting intellectual property, and reducing credit risk.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Links to Third Party Sites</h3><p>The Site may contain links to other sites or resources over which CourseSmart does not have control ("External Web Sites"). In addition, while you are on our Site, you may be re-directed to an External Web Site to complete a transaction. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these External Web Sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site, and to read the privacy policies of each and every External Web Site that collects your Personally Identifying Information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by CourseSmart with respect to your use of the CourseSmart Service. You acknowledge that CourseSmart is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that CourseSmart is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Surveys &amp; Contests</h3><p>We may, from time to time, request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is voluntary and therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes and as otherwise described in this privacy policy.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Special Offers</h3><p>Occasionally, CourseSmart may send registered users information on products, services, and special deals as well as newsletters via email. As a registered user, you will be given the opportunity to elect not to receive such emails from CourseSmart. You may opt-out from receiving these emails from us by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@coursesmart.com" title="support@coursesmart.com">support@coursesmart.com.</a></p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Security</h3><p>We employ technological and administrative measures to protect your Personally Identifying Information from loss, unauthorized access or disclosure. For example, CourseSmart may use firewalls, password protection, secure socket layer and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your Personally Identifying Information.</p><p>The security of your personally identifying information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifying information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@coursesmart.com" title="support@coursesmart.com">support@coursesmart.com.</a></p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Correction/Updating Personal Identifying Information</h3><p>To change your CourseSmart account information (address, credit card, etc.), log on to your CourseSmart account. Click the "My Account" tab on the top tool bar. Edit your account information as needed. If you have questions or need help with making changes, please call customer service at 1-866-588-3197.</p><p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:support@coursesmart.com" title="support@coursesmart.com">support@coursesmart.com.</a> We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Choice/Opt-Out</h3><p>You have the choice of whether or not you would like us to provide your Personally Identifying Information to certain of our participating publishers and third party partners. If you do not want your information shared, during registration and certain purchases you may opt out of receiving certain information from our participating publishers and third party partners. Also, you will be able to opt out by visiting our website <a href="/" title="http://www.coursesmart.com">http://www.coursesmart.com.</a> If you do not opt out, your Personally Identifying Information will be subject to their privacy policies and terms of use and they may contact you with marketing messages. Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of the participating publishers and third party partners to whom we provide your Personally Identifying Information and as such, we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as CourseSmart.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Facebook Connect</h3><p>CourseSmart provides its users with the ability to create a new account, or sign-in to an existing account using their Facebook credentials -- rather than having to establish a separate, CourseSmart username and password. If you choose to use Facebook Connect to sign in to CourseSmart, the first time you select this option you will be prompted by Facebook to allow CourseSmart the privilege of being able to post content to your Facebook Wall and to your friends' News Feeds. Facebook will also ask if you want to allow CourseSmart access to your email address. Accepting both of these requests allows you to use your Facebook credentials to access CourseSmart, and also signals your acceptance of CourseSmart's Terms of Service. If you choose to revoke these privileges from CourseSmart, you can do so at any time by accessing the Applications Settings under the Account menu in Facebook.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Social Media Widgets</h3><p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Testimonials</h3><p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@coursesmart.com" title="support@coursesmart.com">support@coursesmart.com.</a></p><h3 style="padding-top:5px;">Notification of Changes</h3><p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, CourseSmart may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.</p><p>This Privacy Policy was last updated: January 30, 2014</p></div></div></div></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><a class="hidden_links" href="#skiplinks" title="Back to skip links">Back to skip links</a><div class="section_inner"><div id="navigation" role="navigation"><div class="" id="nav_footer"><ul><li class="category"><div class="category_title"><span>Top eTextbooks</span></div><ul><li><a href="/eTextbooks" title="Browse All Textbook Categories"><span>Browse All Categories</span></a></li><li><a href="/disciplines?category=cs.bus_ecn.mgmt">Management</a></li><li><a href="/disciplines?category=cs.bus_ecn.acct">Accounting</a></li><li><a href="/disciplines?category=cs.phy_erth.geogrph">Geography</a></li></ul></li><li class="category"><div class="category_title"><span>About the Site</span></div><ul><li><a href="/sitemap" title="CourseSmart Site Map"><span>Site Map</span></a></li><li><a href="/termsofservice" title="Read about CourseSmart's terms of Service"><span>Terms of Service</span></a></li><li><a href="/privacypolicy" title="Read about CourseSmart's privacy policy"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a></li><li><a href="/accessibility" title="CourseSmart's commitment to accessibility"><span>Accessibility</span></a></li></ul></li><li class="category"><div class="category_title"><span>Customer Support</span></div><ul><li><a href="/help" title="Help Resources"><span>Help</span></a></li><li><a href="/returnpolicy" title="Return Policy">Return Policy</a></li></ul></li><li class="category"><div class="category_title"><span>About CourseSmart</span></div><ul><li><a href="/overview" title="Overview of CourseSmart"><span>Overview</span></a></li><li><a href="/management" title="CourseSmart Management Team"><span>Management</span></a></li><li><a href="/media" title="Read the latest news about CourseSmart"><span>Media</span></a></li><li><a href="/contactus" title="How to Contact CourseSmart"><span>Contact Us</span></a></li></ul></li><li class="category"><div class="category_title"><span>Not a Student?</span></div><ul><li><a href="/affiliates" title="Learn more about the affiliate program"><span>Affiliates</span></a></li><li><a href="/?portal=instructors" title="Instructors">Instructors</a></li><li><a href="/institutions" title="Solutions for Institutions"><span>Institutions</span></a></li><li><a href="/collegestores" title="Learn how to provide CourseSmart products in college stores"><span>College Stores</span></a></li><li><a href="/publishers" title="Information about becoming a publisher partner"><span>Publishers</span></a></li></ul></li></ul><div class="clear"></div></div><div id="email_signup"><div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;
