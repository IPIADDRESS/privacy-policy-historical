<p><b>How We Use the Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you, to enforce the legal terms that govern your use of our Sites, and/or for the purposes for which you provided the information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter or notification, or to contact you about your account with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards or emails you may wish to send them from our Sites, and for such other purposes as may be stated at the point where the information is collected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, services or customized experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to submit content for publication (for example, a posting to a blog or a discussion board, or a video), we may publish your screen name, email address, or other information you have provided to us. We may on occasion combine information we collect through our Sites with information that we collect from other sources. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you register and create a profile with our Sites, the screen name you select as well as other content you submit to your profile (e.g., photos, comments, video, reviews) will be displayed publicly on the Sites and may be reused and redistributed by us in our sole discretion, as set forth in our Terms of Use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, the Katz Affiliates, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that is collected to improve the design and content of our Sites, to deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements, to enable us to personalize your Internet experience, and to perform analytics. We also may use this information to analyze usage of our Sites or content, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Sites, (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards, and (4) enable you to share your experience and content via social networking sites.

<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose information we have collected from you or the device used to access the Sites in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe in our sole discretion it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we may transfer information if we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, merged with or otherwise transferred to another entity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement and are not authorized to use the personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose personally identifiable information and/or Non-Personally Identifiable Information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement. For example, we may share such personally identifiable information we collect with Katz Affiliates to provide, improve and communicate with you about their own products and services. A representative list of our affiliates is available in the Katz Affiliates section below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also share such information with unaffiliated business partners and third parties (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If a Katz Affiliate Site shares personally identifiable information with such unaffiliated third parties, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses either at the point of submission of your personally identifiable information or prior to any such disclosure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this Site, follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this Site. If you have signed up to receive text messages from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may include by replying “STOP” to the received text message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katz Affiliate Sites covered by this privacy statement may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the Site’s activity. We have no control over these third parties’ use of this information. The Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide visitors with additional or more relevant product and service opportunities, to improve and personalize the Sites and to perform analytics, and for the additional uses discussed in this privacy statement, we may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with the Katz Affiliates, third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners.</span></p>
<p><b>Cookies, Web Beacons, Analytics and Advertising</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enhance your online experience, we use “cookies” or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use cookies to understand Site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our Sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Sites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Site), to save your password in password-protected areas, and to enable you to use shopping carts on our Sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners also may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Katz Affiliate Sites. This also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adobe Flash Player is web tool that allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. Katz Affiliate Sites employ locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) in certain situations where we use Flash to provide special content such as video streaming, video on demand, video clips or animation. Flash (and similar applications) use this technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, but Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies or our partners may also use “web beacons,” clear .gifs or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Site or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Site or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Site. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).</span></p>
<p><b>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time the Katz Affiliate Sites do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at Katz Affiliate Sites. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.</span></p>
<p><b>Analytics</b></p>
