The latest update to this Policy is March 18, 2015.</p><p>This Policy describes the information Countable Corporation (“we,” “us” or “Countable”) collects from you via our website or applications, and how we use and share such information.  This Policy does not govern how information is used by parties that we do not control or by individuals who we do not employ. If you visit a website or app that we mention or link to, be sure to review their privacy policy.</p><h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4><p>There are limited pieces of information in this Policy that we collect from you that is “Personally Identifiable Information,” or “PII”.  These are your name, home address, your email address,  your telephone numbers, your picture if you upload it directly to Countable, your unique mobile device ID number, and your social media account IDs.  We take our collection of PII and your privacy expectations very seriously, and therefore have very restricted rules for handling, using and sharing this information, as described in this Policy. It is up to you whether to disclose PII to us, although if you do not do so, certain products and services may not be available for your use on</p><h4>Information that you post to Countable</h4><p>There are many functions and areas of our website and applications where you can post information about yourself, your views, and your affiliations. It is important to remember that some of these areas are publicly viewable to other users and organizations. Countable does not control which information you post to publicly viewable areas. For instance, we enable you to create a publicly viewable user name. If you create a username that identifies you individually, such as your real name, users with access to Countable will be able to see that.  Similarly, placing contact information in your bio or sharing actions that you take on Countable via your social networks will enable access to that information to third parties in a manner that we cannot control.  It is important to distinguish your provision of PII to us directly, which we can control under this Policy, versus information you post publicly or provide to other people, to organizations, or via other services, which Countable cannot control.</p><h4>Your views and affiliations</h4><p>In addition to PII, there is other information that you may share through Countable that we consider sensitive, and to which we apply strict rules.  While this information cannot be used to identify you personally, it does provide insights about the views of people who use   We refer to this information in this Policy as “Your Views”, and includes your stated political party affiliation and the issues you vote on.  Your Views do not include any information that you post publicly or share through your social networks or through message exchanges with other users.  Because Countable does not collect such information directly from you and because, once posted, such information may be immediately accessible by parties that we do not manage, Countable cannot control such information in the way we control information provided to us, which we describe as Your Views in this Policy.</p><h4>Anonymous information</h4><p>We also collect information about the use of the Countable platform which does not reveal your identity.  This information includes browser and device information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies, and demographic information and other non-identifying information provided by you (such as a zip code or general geographic area)</p><h4>How we may use your information</h4><p>There are multiple ways we use your information to provide the best service possible to you.   In doing so, we may use your PII and Your Views to draw your attention to issues in which we believe you may be interested, and to communicate directly with you through email, via our apps, or in your usage of our services.  Here are some examples of the ways we might use your information:</p><ul class="default-list"><li>We use your information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as when you vote on a bill, author an opinion, or participate in other activities.</li><li>We use your information to communicate directly and provide to you information regarding our services and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.</li><li>We use your information for data analysis, developing new services, enhancing, improving or modifying our platform, identifying usage trends, and determining the effectiveness of campaigns.</li><li>We use your information to personalize your experience by presenting legislation, issues and offers tailored to you based on what we know about you. We may also send you promotional communications that we believe may be of interest to you.</li><li>We use your information to facilitate social sharing functionality, such as sharing content and bills through the Countable platform and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</li><li>We use your account information to allow you to send email messages to your email contacts through our platform, such as to share a bill or opinion.</li><li>We use information about your computer or device to ensure that our site, apps and APIs function properly and are optimized for your computer or device.</li><li>If you are using one of our mobile applications, we use your device ID to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings.</li><li>We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to measure and improve our services and develop features and functionalities on our sites, apps and APIs. For example, if we see that people are using a certain device use the platform the most, we might decide to build  our tailor our services specifically for that device.</li><li>We use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to improve the relevance of our marketing campaigns and those of our advertisers. For example, if you voted on a bill regarding the protection of animal rights, you may subsequently see sponsored campaigns from animal protection organizations.</li><li>We use IP Addresses for administration and security purposes, such as calculating usage levels of our sites, apps and API, helping diagnose server problems and detecting fraud and spam behavior.</li><li>We may use and share aggregated and anonymized information to better understand and serve our users or for optimization of our marketing and ad targeting efforts. For example, we may compile statistics about the percentage of our users in a state or county who care about animal rights, or the age range of those users.</li></ul><h4>Who may receive your PII and Your Views</h4><p>a. The Countable community</p><p>Your username, general geographic location (such as city, state, country), and a link to your Countable user profile may be displayed on your profile page, on contributions you make and on related areas.

Our platform provides an open forum for communication by users. We do not monitor, verify, or perform any background check on users.</p><p>b. Your other social media platforms</p><p>You may share your activities on Countable with contacts on other social media sites.  For example, you may share a bill you voted on via Facebook. To share via social networks, you must connect your Countable account with your social media account. In such case, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.

We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose any information about yourself via the social sharing features of our platform.</p><p>c. Advertisers and ad networks</p><p>We may share information about you with advertisers and advertising networks on our platform, except that we will not provide PII to advertisers or ad networks.

If you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please visit  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and  <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>. </p><p>If you are using one of our mobile applications, our ad network partners may use and store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.</p><p>d.  Organizations and Representatives</p><p>Countable maintains pages for organizations and political representatives with which you can interact.  If you interact directly with organizations and representatives on this pages and provide PII on their pages, only the representatives and organizations to whom you have provided PII via the Countable platform will receive your PII.  For instance, if you send a message to your congressional representatives when sharing your voting preference or advocating on issues, and include your email address and name, that information will be made available to your representative.  Countable may also share Your Views with representatives and organizations, provided that we will never associate Your Views with PII when providing PII to representatives or organizations unless you specifically enable a specific interaction.  For instance, if you vote on a balanced budget bill and send a message to your representative informing them how you voted, we will share your full name and email address with that representative.  However, we will not share with that representative how you actually voted on other bills, such as on a minimum wage initiative.  We may share Your Views with representatives and organizations in a manner that does not identify you individually.
