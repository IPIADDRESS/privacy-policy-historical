	COUPONS-BAR - Privacy</p>
<p>
	We at COUPONS-BAR , Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries ("COUPONS-BAR ") are committed to providing web sites and software products that respect the privacy of its visitors and users respectively.&nbsp; This page summarizes the privacy policy and practices for all COUPONS-BAR &nbsp;Web Sites, as well as for the COUPONS-BAR &nbsp;software products.</p>

<p>
	Information Collected</p>
<p>
	Personal Information</p>
<p>
	Currently, we do not ask you to register for our products because we simply do not need you to. We do not require the submission of any information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address and other ("Personal Information"). However, when you commence direct communications with us, we may retain such communications and the accompanying Personal Information in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
<p>
	Statistical Information</p>
<p>
