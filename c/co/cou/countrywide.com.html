															internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of on-line documents and 
															the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead of sending readable 
															text, both your browser and the web site's secure server encode all text using 
															a security key. That way, personal data sent to your browser or data you send 
															back would be extremely difficult to decode in the unlikely event it was 
															intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for encoding is a random 
															number that is unique to your session at the secure web site.
															<br>
															<br>
															There are two grades of internet security: International-grade encryption uses 
															a 40-bit random number negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This 
															means that only one out of about 1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can 
															be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade encryption uses a 128-bit key, so 
															that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. The Countrywide site uses 
															the highest grade of encryption supported by your browser and your internet 
															connection.

															instead of the usual "HTTP://" indicate that the secure protocol is in effect. 
															Your browser may also tell you if security is operating. For example, Netscape 
															Navigator may display the <img height="15" src="images/art/security_key.gif" width="36" border="0">
															icon in the lower left corner of your screen in secure mode. If 128-bit

															indication if the web page you are viewing employs frames (see below).

															secure, Netscape shows the "broken key" <img height="15" src="images/art/security_brokenkey.gif" width="35" border="0">
															icon, and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon.
															<br>
															<br>
															Most browsers can be set to give you a pop-up announcement when you enter or

Fraud Hotline staff work with departments across the Countrywide family of companies to block credit reporting based on claims of identity theft, conduct investigations including reviews of the account or loan documentation, and, if identity theft is confirmed, notify the credit bureaus and correct credit reporting history on affected Countrywide relationships. The Fraud Hotline serves as a single point of contact for consumers to report identity theft complaints to Countrywide and we respond within 48 hours. You can reach the Fraud Hotline by any method described under the <i><a href="#Reporting">Reporting Identity Theft on a Countrywide Relationship</a></i> section below.</td>
