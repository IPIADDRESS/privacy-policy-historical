														<p>Recent versions of most internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of 
															on-line documents and the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead 
															of sending readable text, both your browser and the website's secure server 
															encode all text using a security key. That way, personal data sent to your 
															browser or data you send back would be extremely difficult to decode in the 
															unlikely event it was intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for 
															encoding is a random number that is unique to your session at the secure 
															website.</p>
														<p>There are two grades of internet security: International-grade encryption uses a 
															40-bit random number negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This 
															means that only one out of about 1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can 
															be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade encryption uses a 128-bit key, so 
															that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. The Countrywide site uses

														Your internet session is encrypted if your security-enabled browser is 
														connected to a website using the Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. URL 
														strings beginning with "HTTPS://" instead of the usual "HTTP://" indicate that 
														the secure protocol is in effect. Your browser may also tell you if security is 
														operating. For example, Netscape Navigator may display the <img height="15" src="images/art/security_key.gif" width="36" border="0">
														icon in the lower left corner of your screen in secure mode. If 128-bit 
														security is in effect, it shows the <img height="12" src="images/art/security_2key.gif" width="34" border="0">

														secure, Netscape shows the "broken key" <img height="15" src="images/art/security_brokenkey.gif" width="35" border="0">
														icon, and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon.
														<br>
														<br>
														Most browsers can be set to give you a pop-up announcement when you enter or 
														leave a secure web page. In Netscape, these settings are on the Security 
														Preferences "General" tab. In IE, the setting is on the "Advanced" tab when you
