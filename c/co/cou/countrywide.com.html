												<tr>
													<td class="copy" colspan="2" height="10" width="565">
														Recent versions of most internet browsers support the encrypted transmission of 
														on-line documents and the data you enter on a web page. This means that instead 
														of sending readable text, both your browser and the website's secure server 
														encode all text using a security key. That way, personal data sent to your 
														browser or data you send back would be extremely difficult to decode in the 
														unlikely event it was intercepted by an unauthorized party. The key used for 
														encoding is a random number that is unique to your session at the secure 
														website.
														<p>There are two grades of internet security: International-grade encryption uses a 
															40-bit random number negotiated between your browser and the web-server. This 
															means that only one out of about 1,000,000,000,000 possible decoding keys can 
															be used to decipher your data. Domestic-grade encryption uses a 128-bit key, so 
															that the number of possible keys is vastly larger. The Countrywide site uses 
															the highest grade of encryption supported by your browser and your internet 
															connection.</p>

													<td class="copy" colspan="2" height="10" width="565">
														Your internet session is encrypted if your security-enabled browser is 
														connected to a website using the Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. URL 
														strings beginning with "HTTPS://" instead of the usual "HTTP://" indicate that 
														the secure protocol is in effect. Your browser may also tell you if security is 
														operating. For example, Mozilla's Firefox will display the <img height="15" src="images/art/security_fflock.gif" width="20" border="0">
														icon in the lower right corner of your screen in secure mode. Microsoft 
														Internet Explorer shows a <img height="15" src="images/art/security_mslock.gif" width="15" border="0">
														icon. Note that security may be operating without any visible indication if the 
														web page you are viewing employs frames (see below).
														<p>
														If secure transmission is not in effect or only part of a frame-based page is 
														secure, Firefox shows the "red-slashed lock" icon <img height="15" src="images/art/security_partial_fflock.gif" width="20" border="0">, 
														and Explorer does not show the "lock" icon.</p>
														<p>
														Most browsers can be set to give you a pop-up announcement when you enter or 
														leave a secure web page. In Firefox, these settings are on the Security section 
														when you select "Options" on the Tools menu. In IE, the setting is on the 
														"Advanced" tab when you select "Options" on the View menu.</p>

														window. Both IE and Firefox allow you to open a link in a new window by

														To minimize the potential compromise of your shared secrets, you should avoid

														attacks to crack passwords often use dictionaries in an attempt to randomly 
														match the password), exclusively numbers (numbers range from 0 to 9 for each

														dictionary and the password is of sufficient length, 6 characters or preferably 
														more, to make brute force attacks harder.
														<p>We suggest you do not use shared secrets across multiple domains (e.g. 
															websites). If you use the same logon and password while shopping or surfing 
															online as you use for your bank, if one of the online merchant sites is 
															compromised, your user ID and password could then be used to access your bank

														personal information in many ways, but the most common method is to take it 
														from the victim themselves. They steal mail (such as account statements, 
														new checks and offers of credit) left in a mailbox, discarded in the trash or 
														stored in an easy to get to location in your home or office. They take credit 
														card and personal identification from your purse or wallet. Without knowing it, 
														you may give the information directly to the criminal when you enter data at an 
														unsecured or unknown website, or in response to a fraudulent request for 
														account information through an unverified e-mail ("<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.htm" target="_blank">phishing</a>").

														spend an average of $808 and 205 hours resolving the identity theft. Time and 
														money is spent clearing credit reports, reporting the theft to lenders and 
														merchants, and filing complaints with law enforcement and governmental 
														agencies. One of the menacing problems of identity theft is that it can happen 
														more than once. Once the initial incident is resolved, the thief may begin 
														using the victim’s identity again after waiting 6 months to a year and the
