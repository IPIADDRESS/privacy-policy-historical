Please read the following statement to learn about our information gathering and dissemination practices. The following Privacy Policy should be read along with the CountryCause â€“ Terms of Use for a full understanding of CountryCause's practices as well as the Users responsibilities when interacting with the site <a href="http://countrycause.com/">www.countrycause.com</a></p>

				<h4>Note:</h4>

				<p>Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.</p>

				<p>By visiting this Website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use of the Webiste. If you do not agree please do not use or access the Website.</p>

				<p>By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use.</p>

				<h4>1. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information</h4>

				<p>When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal information, which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>

				<p>In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, either by signing up through our portal or signing in through an associate API such as Google or Facebook, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.</p>

				<p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie".</p>

				<p>We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. At this time, all features of the Website will work even if you disable cookies. However, in the future and in the event that we add certain new or improvised features and services to the Website, the Website or some parts of it may not be accessible if cookies are disabled. You may also be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.</p>

				<p>Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.</p>

				<p>If you choose to donate or contribute on or through the Website, we collect information about your donations patterns and generally your usage behavior.</p>

				<p>If you transact with us (through making donations / contributions), we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details and tracking information from cheques or money orders.</p>

				<p>If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback, we will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide User support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.</p>

				<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>

				<p>We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up an account with us. While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as making a donation / contribution) do require registration. We do use your contact information to send you information such as receipts, certificates, upcoming events, newsletters, etc. We also provide certain data to the Campaigner to interact with you and send you information of the type aforementioned as well as to complete certain transactions and fulfill commitments such as rewards, updates and the like.</p>

				<h4>2. Use of Demographic / Profile Data / Your Information</h4>

				<p>We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses.

Those entities and affiliates may not market to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-in.</p>
