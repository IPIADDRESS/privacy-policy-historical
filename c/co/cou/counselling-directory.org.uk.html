<h3><a id="section_2"></a><b>2. The Site</b></h3>
<p>
We take a proactive approach to user privacy and ensure the necessary steps are taken to protect the privacy of our users throughout their visiting
experience.
</p>
<p>
When you use or contact our Site, you do so at your own discretion and provide any personal details requested at your own risk. Your personal
information is kept private and stored securely until it is no longer required or has no use, as detailed below. Every effort has been made to
ensure a safe and secure form to email submission process but we advise users using our forms that you do so at your own risk.
</p>
<p>As the party responsible for data processing we ensure that the processed data:</p>
<ul>

<h3><a id="section_3"></a><b>3. The types of personal information we collect</b></h3>
<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Information you give us</b>. We collect information you voluntarily provide to us by filling in forms on our Site
<a href="https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk">https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk</a> (our "Site" or "directory"),
by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail, live-chat services, or in other ways. This includes information you provide to us when you contact
professionals listed on our Site, subscribe to our Services, or when you report a problem with our Site. The information you give us may include
your name, address, e-mail address and phone number. If you are
a counsellor or therapist applying for membership to our directory, you may also provide us with information such as financial and credit card information, qualifications,
insurance, professional body documents, personal description and photograph. Where we take any financial payments from you, these will be done
securely and in accordance with industry standards.
</p>
<p><b>Contacting professionals on our site</b></p>
<p>
When you contact
a counsellor or therapist displayed on our site, you are in control of how much and what type of information you choose to provide to us. Although we only require initial
contact information from you, we accept that you may choose to provide us with further information for the benefit of your
counsellor or therapist which may fall under the classification for sensitive personal information.
</p>
<p>
Under GDPR explicit consent is required if you ask us to process Special Categories of Personal Data (previously called ‘sensitive personal data')
for you, such as information about your mental or physical health, your sexual life or orientation, or your religious or philosophical beliefs.
By filling out and using the forms on our Site to contact
a counsellor or therapist,
you agree to us processing your information and providing a copy of it to the counsellor you have selected.
</p>
<p>
We will not be held responsible for the type or nature of information that you have voluntarily disclosed using the contact methods provided on our
Site; however, to ensure that we comply with the requirements of GDPR, we will obtain your explicit consent before we use any such data by asking
you to tick a box on the contact form before submitting it. This will mean that you explicitly affirm your agreement to us in collecting and using
this information for your benefit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Information we collect automatically</b>. Whenever you visit our Site we may automatically collect the following information about you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
technical information. We may, for example, collect information about the type of device you use to access our websites, the Internet protocol
(IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in
types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this Site;
</li>
<li>
information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our Site (including date and
time); pages you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information
(such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page and any phone number used to call our membership
services number.
</li>
<li>
Like many websites, we use "<b>Cookies</b>" to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites.
For detailed information on the cookies we use and their purposes see our Cookie policy
<a href="https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/cookie-policy.php">https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/cookie-policy.php</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Information we receive from other sources</b>. We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other
services we provide - for example, if you subscribe to Happiful.com or use the Happiful mobile app, we may receive information about related
Counselling Directory content that you've viewed. If you're a counsellor/therapist applying to join Counselling Directory we may, for example, proactively obtain information about you from any professional body website(s) that you're
registered with to help us approve your application more quickly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Analytics</b> includes third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel etc) to evaluate your use of the Site, compile reports on activity,
collect demographic data, analyse performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to our Site and internet usage. These
third parties use cookies and other technologies to help analyse and provide us the data. By accessing and using the Site, you consent to the processing
of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Under GDPR we will ensure that your personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting your rights. We will only
process your personal data if at least one of the following basis applies:
</p>
<p>
a) you have given consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes - for example, by signing up to receive our happiful magazine.
</p>
<p>
b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or in order to take steps at the request of you prior to entering into a
contract - for example, if you apply or start to apply to join our Site as a member.
</p>
<p>
c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
</p>
<p>
d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or of another natural person;
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>
e) processing is in our legitimate interests or those of a third party such as our credit card payment processing, unless these interests are overridden by
the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject (this will normally be you). For example, we rely on our legitimate interest basis to analyse and
improve our Services and the content on our websites and apps, to send you information about our services, and offer you suggestions about similar products
and services that might interest you. We can use your personal information in this way because it is in our legitimate interests to provide you with relevant
information when appropriate, so that we may look at ways of establishing and extending our relationship with you.
</p>
<p>
If we receive personal information from another user in the course of providing our Services to you, we expect you to have complete responsibility for making
sure that the contents of this Privacy Notice are brought to their attention and you have obtained their consent in the process.
</p>
<p>
In some instances, it may be appropriate for us to combine your information with other information that we may be holding about you - such as combining your
name with your geographic location or your history with us.
</p>
<p><b><u>If you fail to provide personal data</u></b></p>
<p>
If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most areas of the Site but you may be unable to access certain options
and services. You have the final decision on whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, the collection of personal data may be a statutory or contractual requirement, and we will be limited in the services we can provide you if
you don't provide your personal data - for example, if you do not provide us with your personal data, you will not be able to apply for or maintain membership
of Counselling Directory. We will let you know how this will affect you at the time.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_4"></a><b>4. Cookies</b></h3>
<p>
Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website
and also allows us to improve our Site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie policy
<a href="https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/cookie-policy.php">https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/cookie-policy.php</a>.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_5"></a><b>5. What do we do with information we collect about you and why</b></h3>
<p>
We use your personal information in order to provide you with the products and services we offer. Here are some examples of some of the ways we may use
your data:
</p>
<p>
<b>Example 1 - Using our Site to contact a counsellor</b><br>
If you use our Site to contact a counsellor, we only use
the personal information you enter into the contact form to produce an email which is sent to the counsellor/therapist you've selected.
In this scenario, we will not store your data any longer than needed to complete this process, and we will not use it for any future purposes. You will
be sent a single email receipt to confirm that your enquiry has been sent and giving you the option to subscribe to our magazine, but this will not be
stored on our systems. Our servers record the IP addresses of visitors to our web pages for a short period to enable us to monitor the performance of
our websites, but we will generally delete this data as we do not retain it any longer than necessary. We may also store information about you, such as
your IP address or website activity, in certain database fields to record certain actions - for example, when you contact a professional on our site,
we use Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel to record that you’ve successfully completed this action (none of the personal information that you enter
into the contact form will be included in this action). We use this information to monitor and administer our site (such as evaluating the effectiveness
of our advertising methods).
</p>
<p>
<b>Example 2 - Signing up to our Site as a professional member</b><br>
If you are a counsellor applying to join the directory,
an existing member of the directory, or if you sign up for Site updates, we will use your personal information to administer the service you've signed
up for and to communicate with you - for example, informing you about your account, new services available, security and other types of updates. Likewise,
if you correspond with us e.g. by filling out a feedback or form on our Contact Us page, or contacting us via email, telephone or using our Live Chat
service, we may use this information to improve our service or to communicate with you as outlined above.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example 3 - Signing up to Happiful magazine</b><br>
If you wish to sign up to receive our Happiful magazine (either the free e-magazine or paid printed version), we will use your details to communicate
with you when a new magazine is released, and to keep you informed about other news and services that may be of interest to you. We won't pass your
details on to any third parties other than where necessary for the delivery of the magazine. We will give you the option to adjust your email preferences
or to unsubscribe.
</p>
<p>
This is a summary of the ways that we may use your personal information. Depending on the way that you use our Site - for example, if you use our
Site to email a counsellor as described in Example 1
above - some of these may not apply:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To present Site content as in the most effective manner for you and your device(s).</li>
<li>To provide information, products and services that you request, or which we think may interest you.</li>
<li>To carry out our contracts with you - for instance, if you apply to join our Site, or if you use our contact forms.</li>
<li>To allow you to use our interactive services if you want to.</li>
<li>To enable you to subscribe to our Services or publications.</li>
<li>To tell you about changes to our Services.</li>
<li>To tell you about other goods and services that might interest you.</li>
<li>To administer our Site and for internal operations like trouble shooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes.</li>
<li>As part of our efforts to keep our Site safe and secure.</li>
<li>For our legal records, e.g. we have to retain accounting records for at least 6 years.</li>
<li>For dispute resolution.</li>
<li>To give us feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are already our customer, we will only contact you electronically about things similar to what was previously sold to you. If you are a new
customer, you will only be contacted if you agree to it. If you want to be contacted for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box that you
will find on screen when we collect your data.
</p>
<p>
Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to our marketing communications or
sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. If you don't want us to use your personal data for any of the
other reasons set out in this section, you can let us know at any time by contacting us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk">privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk</a> and we will delete your
data from our systems. However, you acknowledge this will limit our ability to provide the best possible service to you, and some parts of our
service may not be accessible to you as a result.
</p>
<p>
As already indicated above, with your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your data for marketing purposes which may lead
to us contacting you by email and/or telephone with information, news and offers on our Services. We agree that we will not do anything that we
have not agreed to under this Privacy Notice, and we will not send you any unsolicited marketing or spam. We will take all reasonable steps to
ensure that we fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC
Directive) Regulations 2003, as amended in 2004, 2011 and 2015.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_6"></a><b>6. Where we store your data</b></h3>
<p>
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also
be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in, among other things,
the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services like email communications.
</p>
<p>
By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that
your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Where such processing takes place, appropriate controls, such as the
adoption of agreements containing appropriate standard clauses, are in place to ensure that your information is protected to the same standard
as if it were in the UK. We will do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure, and up to date and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<p>
Data security is of great importance to us, and to protect your data we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures
to safeguard and secure data collected through our Site. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors
and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a
duty of confidentiality.
</p>
<p>
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for
keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share passwords with anyone.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will always do our best to protect your
personal data as outlined in this Privacy Notice, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is
at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
We have put procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach, and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach
where we are legally required to do so.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_7"></a><b>7. Disclosing your information</b></h3>
<p>We are allowed to disclose your information in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If we want to sell our business, or our company, we can disclose it to the potential buyer.
</li>
<li>
If we want to sell or buy any business, or assets, we can disclose your personal data to the potential buyer or seller of such business
or assets.
</li><li>
We can disclose it to other businesses in our group which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and any subsidiary as
defined in Section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
 </li>
<li>
We can disclose it if we have a legal obligation to do so, or in order to protect other people's property, safety or rights.
</li>
<li>
We can disclose it if we're obliged to in order to enforce or apply our terms of use
<a href="https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/legalterms.html">https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/legalterms.html</a>
</li>
<li>
We can exchange information with others to protect against fraud or credit risks.
</li>
<li>
In connection with legal proceedings (including prospective proceedings).
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Third parties or publicly available sources</b></p>
<p>
We contract with third parties to supply our Services to you on our behalf. We use a variety of third-party vendors, such as our partners
and suppliers for payment processing, search engine facilities, email communications, technical, advertising and marketing. In some cases,
these third parties may require access to some or all of your data.
</p>
<p>
We only share the appropriate level of personal data to enable the supplier to provide their services. Where your data is required to be
shared we will take all reasonable steps to ensure it is handled safely and securely and in accordance with our and the suppliers' obligations
under GDPR and the law.
</p>
<p>
For questions about third-party vendors, please send an email to
<a href="mailto:privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk">privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Contacting professionals on our site</b></p>
<p>
When you fill out a form to contact
a counsellor or therapist displayed on our site, it is necessary for us to disclose the information you've given us to the counsellor/therapist in
order to provide the service you've requested. We do not use your data for any other purpose, and we will always do our best to protect
your data as outlined in this Privacy Notice.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_8"></a><b>8. Retaining your personal information</b></h3>
<p>
We will retain your personal information for as long as we deem it necessary to enable you to use the Site, to provide Services to you, to
comply with applicable laws (including those regarding document retention), resolve disputes with any parties, and otherwise as necessary
to allow us to conduct our business.
</p>
<p>
We are committed to maintaining confidentiality when you contact our professional members for help; for this reason, when you contact one
of our members using the email form linked from their profile, we will delete the information you entered into the form from our system
immediately after sending your enquiry and your enquiry receipt.
</p>
<p>
All personal information we retain will be subject to this Privacy Notice and our internal retention guidelines. We will also retain data
in an anonymous form for statistical and analytical purposes, for example, to understand how our users interact with our service. If you
have a question about a specific retention period for certain types of personal information we process about you, please send an email to
<a href="mailto:privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk">privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk</a>.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_9"></a><b>9. Your rights</b></h3>
<p>
You can ask us not to use your data for marketing. If you are a member of our Site, you can do this by updating the relevant settings in your
Members' Area, or by contacting us at any time at
<a href="mailto:privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk">privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk</a>. For all other enquiries
of this nature, please contact us at

<li>In certain situations, you can ask that we restrict processing of, or object to processing of, your personal data</li>
<li>In certain situations, you can ask that we delete personal information that we hold about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Where we are using your personal information on the basis of your consent, you are entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Where we
process your personal information based on legitimate interest or the public interest, you have the right to object at any time to that use
of your personal information.
</p>
<p>
We rely on you to ensure that your personal information is complete, accurate and up to date. Please do inform us promptly of any changes to
or inaccuracies in your personal information by contacting
<a href="mailto:privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk">privacy@counselling-directory.org.uk</a>. We will respond to
your request as soon as possible, but certainly within 30 days.
</p>
<p>
We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern you may have about our use of your personal
information. If, however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you may have the right to file
a complaint with the UK supervisory authority - details of which are found in section 13 of this policy.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_10"></a><b>10. Links to other sites</b></h3>
<p>
Please note that our terms and conditions and our policies will not apply to other websites that you get to via a link from our Site. We have no
control over how your data is collected, stored or used by other websites, and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites
before providing any data to them.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, when you first contact or enter into correspondence with a professional displayed on our site, you will become subject to the privacy
terms of that professional. You can request specific details from the counsellor/therapist themselves.
</p>
<h3><a id="section_11"></a><b>11. Changes</b></h3>
<p>
This Privacy Notice was last updated on 26th September 2018 to add new provisions to the policy applicable regarding the use of Facebook Pixel
/ Analytics. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page. If we decide to, and if we have a valid email address stored
for you as outlined in the sections above, we may also email you to let you know about any changes.
</p>
