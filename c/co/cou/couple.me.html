		<h1>TenthBit Privacy Policy</h1>
	
		<em>Last updated: October 1, 2013</em>
		<br><br>
		<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. Our privacy policy will explain how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by TenthBit Inc. (TenthBit) with respect to your access and use of TenthBit’s web site couple.me, mobile applications and services (“Couple ”).</p>

		<p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tenthbit.com">support@tenthbit.com</a>.</p>
	
		<p>Our privacy policy may be modified from time-to-time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on our privacy policy the date it was last updated. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this web site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
	
		<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
	
		<p>"Personal Information” is personally identifiable information such as your name, telephone number and email address and any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of Couple. Our privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
	
		<h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
	
		<p>We actively collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us including but not limited to:</p>

			<li>3) birthday and anniversary dates,</li>
			<li>4) and phone number</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>when you create an account, send us an email or submit content to the Couple.</p>
	
		<p>We automatically collect certain information when you use Couple, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1) your Internet Protocol (IP) address,</li>
			<li>2) your device type, and</li>
			<li>3) your operating system version.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>

		<p>When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1) the type of device you use,</li>
			<li>2) operating system version,</li>
			<li>3) and the device identifier (or "UDID").</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We also collect your location-based information for the purpose of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1) attaching location information to photos and videos,</li>
			<li>2) reminding users of memories they've had in various places,</li>
			<li>3) or providing search services for user memories using location information.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you this service. You may opt-out of location-based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@tenthbit.com">support@tenthbit.com</a>.</p>
	
		<p>As part of our service, we ask that you request a friend to join. We will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting them to visit the service, with a one-time follow up email thereafter . We store this information so that you will be connected to each other when using the service.  Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
	
		<h2>How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?</h2>
	
		<p>Generally, we collect, store, use and disclose information to enable us to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1) provide Couple,</li>
			<li>2) create your account,</li>
			<li>3) identify you as a user,</li>
			<li>4) respond to your inquiries and emails,</li>
			<li>5) improve the Couple,</li>
			<li>6) send you administrative and service related communications,</li>
			<li>7) and send you newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without informing you first by updating this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
		<p>Except for the limited disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell customer lists or any personal information to third parties, and we will endeavor to keep your email address private.</p>
	
		<p>Anonymous aggregate statistics that do not personally identify a Couple user will be kept and used by us for various purposes including analysis and reporting of usage patterns. TenthBit reserves the right to use and disclose anonymous aggregate statistics for any purpose and to any third party in its sole discretion.</p>
	
		<h2>What Do We Share With Third Parties?</h2>
	
		<p>From time to time we may employ third parties to help us provide or improve Couple. These third parties, such as our analytics or hosting provider, may have limited access to databases of user information or registered member information solely for the purpose of helping us provide or improve the Couple and they will not be able to use the information about our members or visitors for any other purpose.</p>

		<p>We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the terms of use for a new service or by revising this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
		<p>We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including messages) to a third party without your consent:</p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>a) if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities,</li>
			<li>b) in connection with any legal investigation,</li>
			<li>c) when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on TenthBit,</li>
			<li>d) to any third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Aside from what is set forth in our privacy policy, we will store any content submitted to Couple for the sole purpose of displaying that content only to the person with whom you are paired, or for whom you are currently waiting to accept your pair request, at the time of submission. Your content will only be accessed by Tenthbit, Inc. employees for the purposes of technical support. When you make a request for technical support that may require us to access your content, we will notify you and seek permission before accessing your timeline.</p>
