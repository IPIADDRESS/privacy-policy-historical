</font><blockquote><font face="ARIAL">

</font>
The CouponSurfer.com mission is to simplify the shopping experience of on-line
consumers by providing a dedicated web site of major brand promotions.
Consumers view coupons at their convenience with an interactive easy-to-use format. 
CouponSurfer.com saves consumers time and money by eliminating the need for searching
through newspapers or hundreds of web sites.
<p>
To achieve this mission, we need to collect information to understand what 
products and services you are most interested in. We collect this information in two ways. 
</p><p>
First, you provide us with some basic information when you register. All of the information we collect, is 'aggregated', meaning that the information from many
users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal
information of any particular user. We also sometimes receive updated email addresses from our trusted partners so that we can correct our records 
and communicate more easily (if you selected to receive emails). We use this aggregated information to
provide you with the regional and national brand coupons you are interested in. CouponSurfer.com will not disclose any information about any individual user
except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. Please note that as CouponSurfer.com grows, we may sell or buy other companies or assets. In such 
transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred assets. Also in the unlikely event that CouponSurfer, Inc. or it's assets are acquired, 
customer information will be one of the transferred assets. 
</p><p>
Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie"
when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information that Web sites transfer to your computer's
hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use Cookies so that you won't have to
re-enter your password and CouponSurfer ID when you visit CouponSurfer.com. 
Cookies are also used to track user trends and patterns. The use of cookies
is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up
to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you
when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should
understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser
to not accept cookies. 
</p><p>
In addition when you become a member you can select whether to receive new coupon alerts emails 
and a CouponSurfer.com emails newsletter. Besides the user confirmation message, you will only 
receive email from CouponSurfer.com if you choose to receive new coupon alerts or the CouponSurfer.com. 
You have the option to change your email preferences at any time if you wish to stop receiving email from 
CouponSurfer.com by going to http://www.couponsurfer.com/user_update.cfm or contacting support@couponsurfer.com
</p><p>
Information Sharing and Disclosure
<br>
CouponSurfer.com may use contractors or vendors to help us provide some of the services at our site. If we need to disclose 
personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept 
confidential and is used only for those services.
