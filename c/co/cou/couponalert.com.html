                Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property. None of the Submissions shall be subject to
                any obligation of confidence on our part, and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any
                Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own, and you assign to us, all
                right, title and interest in and to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and
                we shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or
                otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.

            </p><h3>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h3>

            <p>There are a number of places within the CouponAlert Site and CouponAlert Services where you may click on
                a link to access other websites or access other products that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
                For example, if you click on a news link, social media link or advertisement, you may be taken to a
                website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect
                information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with
                information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy
                statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically
                located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

            </p><h3>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>If you have registered with the CouponAlert Site, you have the ability to review and update your personal
                information online by logging into your account. You can also review and update your personal
                information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.

            </p><p>If you have registered with the CouponAlert Site you also may choose to close your account at any time by
                clicking <a href="http://www.email.couponalert.com/Unsub.do?a=u&amp;e=">Here</a>. You will need to be
                signed into the member account
                that you would like to cancel. If you are not currently signed into an account, you will be prompted to
                so do during the cancellation process. You will also see the option to only cancel your email address,
                and not your entire registration, if this is your intention. Please note that it may take up to 5
                business days for your cancellation request to be processed. After you close
                your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information.
                However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account, we may still retain certain
                information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as
                to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem
                necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise
                permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as
                described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties'
                policies.

            </p><h3>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in your inability to
                    use or access certain features of the CouponAlert Site or CouponAlert Services, purchase products or
                    services, participate in a promotion, ask a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.
                </li><li>When you register on our website, you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email
                    messages and/or newsletters about new features, events, product updates, improvements, special
                    offers, or containing special distributions of content by us. At any time you can choose to no
                    longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on
                    <a href="http://www.email.couponalert.com/Unsub.do?a=u&amp;e=">
                        http://www.email.couponalert.com/Unsub.do?a=u&amp;e=
                    </a>
                    and editing your preferences with respect to the receipt of commercial or
                    promotional emails, or by contacting customer service. You also will be given the opportunity, in
                    any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It
                    may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of
                    transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative
                    notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note
                    that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email
                    communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already
                    provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event
                    provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to
                    change you preferences directly with that third party.
                </li><li>You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of
                    companies for direct marketing purposes by emailing us at
                    <a href="mailto:support\at\help\dot\couponalert\dot\com">support\at\help.couponalert.com</a>.
                </li><li>
                    <p>If you have installed the CouponAlert Toolbar, you may terminate the collection of information due
                    to the installation of the CouponAlert Toolbar at any time by removing the CouponAlert Toolbar from
                    your computer. All information collected up to the date on which you remove the CouponAlert Toolbar
                    from your computer will be treated in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of
                    use, and your then-current preferences as indicated in your profile.

                    </p><p>You can choose not to allow Mindspark to collect certain information, but that may result in you
                        being unable to use all of the features of the CouponAlert Site and/or Toolbar. You may tell us
                        not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for
                        direct marketing purposes by clicking on the following link and entering the email address
                        associated with your account:

            </ul>

            <h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help
                safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized
                employees are permitted to access your information, and they may do so only for permitted business
                functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of any personal information between your
                system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
                personal information.

            </p><p>We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure.
                Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not
                expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
                Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should
                avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade
                Commission's website at
                <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">FTC</a>
                for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

            </p><h3>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>

            <p>Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
                children under the age of 13.

            </p><h3>VISITING OUR WEBSITES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</h3>

            <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on or via the CouponAlert Site from
                residents of the United States. If you are using the CouponAlert Site from outside the United States,
                please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States
                where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws
                of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please
                be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our
                services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third
                parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.

                </p><h3>NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</h3>

            <p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any
                personal information relating to users of the website.

            </p><h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

            <p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When
                we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of
                this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your
                personal information, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently
                provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address),
                and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the CouponAlert Site. We recommend that you check
                our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our
                other policies.

            </p><h3>HOW TO CONTACT US</h3>

            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if
                you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for
                their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by email or postal mail as follows: <br>

            <p class="indented">A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping
                purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you
                close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie
                remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

            </p><p class="indented">Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on
                our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our
                site. When you sign in to your account on our website, we will record your user or member ID and the
                name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your
                password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic
                sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member
                account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a
                user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service
                providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as
                doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.
                You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the
                toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our
                website may not function properly.

            </p><p class="indented">We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad
                networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as
                cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website
                does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about
                where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver,
                and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also
                may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of
                that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to
                deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising
                companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which

            <p class="indented">Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a
                unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users
                or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons
                are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of
                this sentence. <br>
                Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain
                pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional [or other] e-mail
                messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may
                receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement
                displayed on a third-party website.
