            <br>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies
            which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling

            in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to
            visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside
            or outside the United States.
            <br><br><u>Aggregated and non-personal information</u>. We may share aggregated and non-personal
            information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and
            our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of
            third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal
            information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties,
            including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
            For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our CouponAlert Site and the most
            popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and
            may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of
            interest and to target content and advertising.

In addition, you warrant that all so-called "moral rights" in those materials have been waived.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Materials contain creative suggestions, recommendations, ideas, notes, drawings, or other information (collectively, the "Submissions"), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on our part, and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own, and you assign to us, all right, title and interest in and to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the universe and we shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Submissions.
            <br><br>
            <b>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</b><br><br>
            There are a number of places on the CouponAlert Site where you may click on a link to access other
            websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on a news link, social
            media link or advertisement, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party
            websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you
            and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We
            recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on
            the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
            <br><br><b>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
            You can choose not to allow Mindspark to collect certain information, but that may result in you being
            unable to use all of the features of the CouponAlert Site and/or Toolbar.
            You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies

            <br><br><b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br><br>
            We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help
            safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized
            employees are permitted to access your information, and they may do so only for permitted business
            functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of any personal information between your
            system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
            personal information. <br>
            <br>We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure.
            Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not
            expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
            Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should
            avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's
            website at

            services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third
            parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
            <br><br><b>NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</b><br><br>
            This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any
            personal information relating to users of the website.

            A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes.
            Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close
            your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains
            on your hard drive for an extended period of time. <br>
            Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on
            our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our
            site. When you sign in to your account on our website, we will record your user or member ID and the
            name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your
            password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic
            sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member
            account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a
            user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service
            providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as
            doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.
            You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the
            toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our
            website may not function properly.

            <br><br>We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to
            display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to
            collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not
            provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where
            you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and
            possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also
            may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of
            that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to
            deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising
            companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which
            offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies

            <a name="beacons"><b>Web Beacons:</b></a><br><br>

            Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique
            identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or
            to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons
            are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of
            this sentence. <br>
            Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain
            pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional [or other] e-mail
            messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may
            receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement
            displayed on a third-party website.
