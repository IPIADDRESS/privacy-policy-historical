		  <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong><br>
			Personal Data<br>
			Only a user's email address is collected when users provide registration to CouponSnapshot. You agree that CouponSnapshot may send you periodical emails promoting coupons and specials from the CouponSnapshot merchant base that may be of interest to you. All CouponSnapshot email newsletters can be opted out of by simply clicking on a link within each email to remove your email address from the list. Email addresses are never shared or sold to third-party marketers or third-party agencies.<br>
			<br>
            Aggregated Information<br>
            Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit and information volunteered by users, is collected through various methods. For example, CouponSnapshot collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from CouponSnapshot, our servers log your IP address. CouponSnapshot only uses IP addresses for the purposes of web traffic analysis and trends.
              <p><br>
                Use of Cookies<br>
              CouponSnapshot also uses cookies to store information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow CouponSnapshot to measure activity on the site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.<br>
              <br>
