</p><h1>Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h2>Effective: 28th May 2012</h2>
<p>Coggles Limited is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This page explains:</p>
<ul>
   <li>What personally identifiable information of yours is collected
   </li><li>What organisation is collecting the information
   </li><li>How the information is used
   </li><li>With whom the information may be shared
   </li><li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
   </li><li>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Coggles Limited's control
   </li><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
</li></ul>
<h2>Under 18's</h2>
<p>
   Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under 18 years of age) do
   not submit any personal information to us.
</p>
<h2><a id="section1"></a>Section 1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
   Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth,
   efficient, and personalised experience while using our web-site. This allows us to provide
   services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customise our service to make
   your experience easier and quicker.
</p>
<p>
   To fully use our web-site and make purchases, you will need to register as a customer, where
   you will be required to provide us with your contact information and some other information
   relating require to process any orders you place with us. We automatically track certain
   information about you based upon your behaviour on our site. We use this information to do
   internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and
   serve our users.
</p>
<p>
   We use a web analytics tool to analyse site usage, how our users arrive at our site, what they
   do on the site, what browser they are using and on what operating system etc. However, this
   analytics data, collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site, is not tied to personally
   identifiable information.
</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>
   We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how
   to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a> for detailed
   guidance.
</p>
<p>
   The following describe the cookies we use on this site and what we use them for. Currently
   we operate an 'implied consent' policy which means that we assume you are happy with this
   usage. If you are not happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should delete
   coggles.com cookies having visited the site, or you should browse the site using your
   browser's anonymous usage setting (called "Incognito" in Chrome, "InPrivate" for Internet
   Explorer, "Private Browsing" in Firefox and Safari etc.)
</p>
<h4>"Session" Cookies</h4>
<p>
   We use a session cookie to remember your log-in for you and what you've put in the shopping
   basket. These we deem strictly necessary to the working of the website. If these are disabled
   then various functionality on the site will be broken - including the ability to place orders.
</p>
<h4>Persistent Cookies for Site Analytics &amp; Performance</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h5>Google AdSense</h5>
      <p>
         This cookie is used by Google to report to us how the adverts shown on
         coggles.com are performing. User data is all anonymous.
         You can find out more generally about Google and its policies and principles as regards
         advertising at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a>
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h5>DoubleClick (Google)</h5>
      <p>
         This is very similar to the cookie above (both are owned/controlled by Google) but is
         specific to the display advertising on coggles.com site. User data is anonymous.
         As above, you can find out more generally about Google and its policies and principles
         as regards advertising at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a>
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <h5>Google Analytics</h5>
      <p>
         We use this to understand how the site is being used in order to improve the user
         experience. User data is all anonymous.
         You can find out more about Google's position on privacy as regards its analytics service
         at <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a>
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>
<h4>Social Buttons</h4>
<p>
   On many of the pages of the site you will see 'social buttons'. These enable users to share
   or bookmark the web pages. There are buttons for: Twitter, Google +1, Facebook 'Like' and
   others. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant social networks
   and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of coggles.com. You should be
   aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around
   the internet, including on coggles.com's site. So if you click on any of these buttons,
   these sites will be registering that action and may use that information. In some cases these
   sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting coggles.com, and the specific pages
   you are on, even if you don't click on the button if you are logged into their services, like Google
   and Facebook. You should check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how
   exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.
</p>
<h4>External Web Services</h4>
<p>
   We use a number of external web services on the coggles.com site, mostly to display
   content within our web pages. For example; to show videos we use Vimeo and YouTube. This
   is not an exhaustive or complete list of the services we use, or might use in the future, when
   embedding content, but these are the most common. As with the social buttons we cannot
   prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this
   embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know
   who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays,
   loads etc.
</p>
<h4>Email Tracking</h4>
<p>
   Some emails that we send you have no tracking in at all e.g. service emails such as order
   notifications. Other emails we send we put in tracking so that we can tell how much traffic
   those emails send to our site but we do not know who has clicked so the data is anonymous
   e.g. our daily newsletter. Some emails we can track, at an individual level, whether the user
   has opened and clicked on the email. We rarely use the latter information at a personal level,
   rather we use it to understand open and click rates on our emails to try and improve them.
   Sometimes we do use the personal information e.g. to re-email people who didn't click the first
   time. If you want to be sure that none of your email activity is tracked then you should opt out of
   Coggles Limited's emails which you can do via <a href="https://www.coggles.com/store/account">My Account</a>.
</p>
<h4>Surveys &amp; Contests</h4>
<p>
   From time to time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a
   particular service (e.g. newsletter). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
   voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
   Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration)
   and may include supplementary information as appropriate to the survey or contest. We will use
   the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site though
   on request we will provide details of any winner's name. If the survey or contest has a sponsor
   then we may share information given by entrants with the sponsor, but only with the user's
   consent.
</p>
<h4>Payment Processing</h4>
<p>
   In order to process payments online we require the billing address for the credit card used and
   your credit card details, which are passed to our payment processor, DataCash. For details of
   how this information is used, please see <a href="#section3">Section 3</a> below.
</p>
<h2><a id="section2"></a>Section 2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
   We use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional
   efforts, to statistically analyse site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to
   customise our site's content, layout, and services. We believe these uses allow us to improve
   our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs.
</p>
<p>
   We use your email address to send you newsletters or other communications that you have
   requested from the Site. Out of respect for our users we offer an opt-out (see <a href="#section4">Section 4</a> below).
</p>
<p>
   We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from
   your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any disputes, troubleshoot problems
   and enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify
   problems or resolve disputes, and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your
   information to look for users using multiple User IDs or aliases.
</p>
<h2><a id="section3"></a>Section 3. Payment Processing</h2>
<p>
   We take online payments for our products and/or services. We use DataCash as our external
   payment provider. In addition to the information outlined above, we require the billing address
   of the credit card you use so that we can pass this to DataCash who check the address against
   the cardholder's details for security purposes. We don't store the credit card details on our
   server but we do store the billing details and a unique reference to your card details on the
   DataCash server so that we can process refunds or so you can pay again with the same card
   more easily. We also use the billing details in case we need to contact you regarding payments
   e.g. for a failed transaction. DataCash requires that you provide your credit card details to
   process the transaction. This is done on our secure server and this data is passed immediately
   and securely to DataCash for their processing. All communications between our servers and
   DataCash pass over an encrypted connection using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
</p>
<p>
   Your Personal Information is stored in our databases. Please note that the information you
   enter is not transferred outside of the European Economic Area by Coggles Limited. There
   may be circumstances though where we need to provide appropriate details to third parties to
   complete the service purchased by you (such as passing your details to a delivery company to
   effect delivery of goods you have purchased). In these circumstances, we cannot confirm where
   these third parties store their data. By submitting your information, you consent to this transfer.
</p>
<p>
   Coggles Limited complies with the UK Data Protection Act 1998.
</p>
<h2><a id="section4"></a>Section 4. Email Communications</h2>
<p>
   As part of the registration process for joining as a customer of Coggles Limited you have
   the opportunity to opt in or out to our marketing email communications. If at any stage you wish
   no longer to receive any emails that you receive from the site you can stop them coming by
   changing your preferences in the "Newsletter Preferences" section under "My Account". You
   can also opt-out directly by using the Unsubscribe links contained within these e-mails.
</p>
<h2><a id="section5"></a>Section 5. Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>
   We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.
</p>
<p>
   Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your
   private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in
   ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
   By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information
   to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully
   intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorise us
   to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we,
   in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of
   fraud, Intellectual Property Rights infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us
   to legal liability.
</p>
<h4>Advertisers</h4>
<p>
   We do aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in aggregate
   to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations,
   we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify
   you. There are some cases where we do pass on your personal details, however we only do
   this if you explicitly agree to this, typically by checking an opt-in checkbox where the default
   position will be that you do not agree to your details being passed on. For example, where we
   have events such as Supplier Showcases you may choose to opt-in, at the time of registering
   for the event, to allow your details to be passed on to those presenting.
</p>
<h4>Payment and Credit Card Details</h4>
<p>
   As explained above, we store a unique reference against your card details which allows
   us to process refunds automatically. Only the last four digits of your card number are
   available to Coggles Limited admin staff. The first twelve digits are hidden so that
   Coggles Limited staff cannot see your full card details. None of your card details, or
   billing details, are published on the site in any way, nor are they visible to other users on your
   membership account.
</p>
<h4>Legal Requests</h4>
<p>
   Coggles Limited cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties
   to enforce laws, Intellectual Property Rights and other rights. Local and international law
   enforcement agencies can request and may receive your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<h4>Suppliers and Other Service Providers</h4>
<p>
   From time to time we use third party Suppliers and Service Providers to facilitate our services.
   Where any Service Provider collects information directly from you (such as the situation where
   we ask a Service Provider to conduct a survey for us) you will be notified of the involvement
   of the Supplier or Service Provider, and all information disclosures you make will be strictly
   optional.
</p>
<h2><a id="section6"></a>Section 6. Control of Your Password</h2>
<p>
   Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your Coggles Limited 
   password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your
   password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and
   may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has
   been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password by visiting
   the "Change Password" section in "My Account".
</p>
<p>
   If you wish to change your password you can do so at any time through the "Change Password"
   section in "My Account" section of the site.
</p>
<h2><a id="section7"></a>Section 7. Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>
   You can at any time review and change the information you submitted during registration by
   visiting the "My Account" section of the site.
</p>
<p>
   You must promptly update your information if it changes. Once posted, you cannot change or
   remove any public postings made in our forums or other message areas or the feedback area.
</p>
<p>
   You can at any time ask to see and have removed any information that we have stored on you,
   though we reserve the right to charge for this service. Please contact Coggles Limited if
   you would like your personal information removed. We will retain in our files information you
   have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
   problems and enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions. Further, such prior information is never
   completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we
   back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable
   information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests that it
   be removed.
</p>
<h2><a id="section8"></a>Section 8. Other Information Collectors</h2>
<p>
   Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses
   the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose
   your information to other parties, whether they are other members of the Site or other sites
   throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal
   information you disclose to them.
</p>
<h2><a id="section9"></a>Section 9. Security</h2>
<p>
   In order to process and help protect your credit card details, we use SSL (Secure Sockets
   Layer) to secure all communications between the site and you where sensitive information
   is being exchanged. This includes (but is not limited to) Registration, Login, My Account and
   Checkout pages.
</p>
<p>
   On the Coggles Limited site we use best endeavors to safeguard the confidentiality of
   your personally identifiable information but we do not use encryption to store your personally
   identifiable informations. This is because we do not believe that the personal information we
   currently collect warrants such measures and the accompanying loss of speed experienced.
   You should be aware that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
</p>
<h2><a id="section10"></a>Section 10. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
   If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
   stated at the time of collection we will make any changes to this Privacy Policy and post them
   to our site. It is up to you whether you then continue to use the site and Coggles Limited's
   services following such changes. However, it is assumed that you accept such changes if you
   continue to use the site and services. If you do not accept such changes then you should stop
   using Coggles Limited's site and services and contact us, as per above, should you wish
   to have any of your details removed.
