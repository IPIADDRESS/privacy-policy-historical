We will specifically designate the fields for compulsory completion.</p>
<p>Further personally identifiable information may be collected while we monitor your performance and progress and when we exchange communications with you, for example, if you submit an inquiry to our customer support.</p>
<p>We may automatically collect information through the use of log files and other means. If you register with the Services, then the information gathered will be partially personally identifiable. If you are not a registered user, we will not knowingly make use of information personally identifying you, except as specifically indicated in this policy, or on our Websites.</p>

<li>to handle inquiries and complaints and to collect fees;</li>
<li>to send you updates and notices, to provide you with information relating to the Services and to provide you with further marketing and advertising material, subject to your prior indication of consent [prior consent is a must under EU law, but not under US law]. At any time you may opt out of our mailing lists, by contacting us at the '<a href="contact_us">Contact us</a>' page on the Websites.

<li>to contact you when we believe it to be necessary;</li>
<li>to comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies as required;</li>
<li>to collect fees and debts, and to prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity thefts and any other misuse of the Services;</li>

<li>For any other purpose stipulated in this policy, or in the Terms of Use and the License Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>When you use the Services. In these cases, we will share your information only to the extent required to facilitate your use of the Services;</li>
<li>When you perform an on-line assessment test or an assessment in any other form. In these cases, we may share your personal details and our evaluation of your performance with a third party (such as your insurance company, or your employer's car fleet manager), if the test was ordered by the third party, or otherwise conducted in collaboration with the third party;</li>
<li>If we reasonably believe that you have breached the Terms of Use or the License Agreement, or abused your rights to use any of the Services, or performed any act or omission that we reasonably believe to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations. We may share your information in these cases with law enforcement and other competent authorities and with any third party, as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;</li>
<li>If we are required, or reasonably believe that we are required by law to share or disclose your information;</li>
<li>In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and us, or between you and other users or third parties with respect to, or in relation with the Services;</li>
<li>In any case where we may reasonably believe that sharing information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or damage to property;</li>

<li>We may also share personally identifiable information with companies or organizations connected, or affiliated with us, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies, with the express provision that their use of such information must comply with this policy.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Log files and aggregated information</h5>
<p>When you use the Websites or purchase a Product, we automatically collect further information and store it in web-server log files. For example, we may record the frequency and scope of your use of the Websites, the duration of your sessions, the web pages that you visit, the information that you read, advertisements that you view or click on, and the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to sign-in or use the Websites.</p>
<p>We may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information, including by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information through the Services, and providing the information to users, suppliers, business partners, affiliates and any other third party, at our sole discretion, provided however, that the information will not identify you personally and that we will not knowingly, or intentionally use such information to reveal your identity without your consent, under the terms of this policy.</p>
<p>We may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information to properly operate and administer the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience and customize the Services, to create new services, to change or cancel existing content or services and to facilitate other internal, functional and statistical purposes.</p>
<h5>Accessing your personal account</h5>
<p>At any time, you may access your personal account and edit, or amend your personal information. If you find that the information, such as the billing or shipping information is not accurate, complete or updated, than you must make all necessary changes to correct it. Please keep in mind that providing false, incorrect, incomplete, or out dated information may prevent you from registering with or using the Services, and/or may impair our ability to provide you with the Services, handle shipping arrangements or provide you with support and contact you when required.</p>
<h5>Data retention</h5>
<p>At any time, we may review, retain and disclose any information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, as well as our internal needs. However, by doing so we do not either expressly or impliedly endorse, affirm or in any manner assume any responsibility for such information.</p>
<h5>Deletion of personally identifiable information</h5>
<p>If you wish to delete your personally identifiable information that is stored in our databases, you may notify us of such request at the following email address: <a href="mailto:support@cognifit.com" onclick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/mailto/support@cognifit.com');">support@cognifit.com</a>. CogniFit will inform you whether your request has been accepted and may refuse to comply with your request, for example, if CogniFit believes that deleting certain information might prevent maintaining necessary contact with you, or jeopardize certain activities on the Websites, or harm other users. In any case, CogniFit may keep any aggregated or anonymized information for statistical, marketing and other purposes.</p>
<h5>Information security</h5>
<p>We implement information-security systems and procedures to secure the information stored on our servers. Such systems and procedures reduce the risk of security breaches, but they do not provide absolute security. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our services are immune to unauthorized access to the information stored therein and to other information-security risks.</p>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>We may use cookies on the Websites. Cookies are packets of information sent by our servers to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses our servers. We may use cookies on your web browser whether you are a registered user, or not.</p>
<p>We may use cookies for various purposes, such as to save you the need to re-enter your user name and password each time you log in, to facilitate the use of the Services, to collect statistical information with respect to the use of the Services, to verify information, to customize the Services to your personal preferences and for information security purposes.</p>
<p>Some of the cookies may expire when the session ends and you exit your browser. Other cookies are saved on your computer’s hard drive. If you wish to block our cookies, then please use the help button in your browser and follow the necessary instructions. However, bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent your use of the Services, or certain features thereof.</p>

All substantial changes that we make to this policy will be notified on the websites and take effect 30 days following their initial posting. Other changes will take effect 7 days after their initial posting on the Websites, unless we amend the policy to comply with legal requirements. In the latter cases the amendments will become effective as required.</p>
