<h2>Cotton On Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This website, <a href="http://www.cottonon.com">www.cottonon.com</a>, (the “Website”) is owned and operated by Cotton On Clothing Pty Ltd, ABN 80 929 269 126 (“Cotton On,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) of 14 Shepherd Court, North Geelong, Victoria, Australia, 3215.</p>
<p>We appreciate that, as a user of this Website, you are concerned about your privacy and the confidentiality and security of any personal information that you may provide to us in accessing this Website.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement explains our policies for the use, disclosure and storage of personal information collected through this Website.  This Privacy Statement also gives you choices as to how we use your information. Please be sure to read this Privacy Statement carefully before you provide any personal information to us through this Website or otherwise use this Website.</p>
<p>Whenever you use this Website and provide any personal information to us while using this Website, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and storage of that information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2>
<p>Personal information is information about you that can be used to identify you individually. Some common examples of personal information include your name, gender, date of birth, postal address, telephone number, email address and other information necessary to process any order made by you.</p>
<p>Every time you visit this Website, we automatically collect your internet service provider’s address, the Web page from which you came, and a record of your activity on our site.  We also collect the information you provide to us when you register an account with us, request a catalog, make a purchase from us, subscribe to a mailing list, apply for employment, participate in a contest or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey or questionnaire, or otherwise contact us.</p>
<h2>Why do we collect personal information and how do we use it?</h2>
<p>The information we receive allows us to tailor our product offer and improve your shopping experience. It also enables us to process your purchases, confirm your orders, customize the content and layout of our pages, notify you about updates to our websites and products, and provide you with marketing information.</p>
<p>The information you supply to us is added to our customer database. You may receive periodic mailings or telephone calls from us about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events. You can request to not receive such mailings or telephone calls from us by contacting us on <a href="mailto:customerenquiries@cottonon.com.au" target="_blank">customerenquiries@cottonon.com.au</a> or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link on any promotional email you receive from us.</p>
<p>You do not have to provide any personal information to us unless you want to. For example, you choose whether to purchase our products or sign up for our mailing list or for special promotions.   Of course if you choose not to provide certain types of personal information to us, we may be unable to provide you with the goods or services that you have requested where that information is necessary to providing such goods or services.</p>
<p>We do not collect or store credit card numbers that you may submit in connection with online purchases of goods or services through our Website. Any credit card information that you submit for such online purchases is collected by our financial institution which provides the particular payment transaction facility through a separate website. We have no control over that third party website, or access to your credit card information submitted there.  We encourage you to review the privacy statement governing that third party website before entering your payment information.</p>
<h2>When do we disclose personal information?</h2>
<p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal information about you to or with third parties or affiliates, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement. We may disclose your personal information to third parties and affiliates as is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected, such as to fulfill your orders or respond to your requests, and to operate the business of the Cotton On Group.  We may also share your personal information with third parties or affiliates in the event of an acquisition of our business or similar transaction, to enforce our legal rights or those of others, or if we are required to do so by law.</p>
<p>We may share information with governmental agencies or other third parties for purposes of prevention or investigation of fraud or other illegal activities. We may only do so when:</p>
<ol>
<li>permitted or required by law;</li>
<li>necessary to prevent actual or potential fraud, unauthorized transactions, or other illegal activities; or</li>
<li>investigating fraud incidents or other illegal activities.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do we store personal information?</h2>
<p>The personal information which we collect from you may be stored by us in various forms including both electronic and hardcopy. We take reasonable steps designed to maintain the security of any personal information which we have stored, including taking reasonable steps to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorised access, use, modification, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of such information.</p>
<p>Please be aware however that any online transmission of information over the Internet is never completely secure and may be prone to error or attacks by malicious third parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security or accuracy of any personal information that you transmit to us through this Website.</p>
<h2>Accessing the personal information which we have collected about you</h2>
<p>You may request access to any personal information which we have about you by contacting our Privacy Officer (whose details are set out below). Following such a request, we will provide you with access once you have:</p>
<ol>
<li>provided sufficient proof of identity, and</li>
<li>in the case of unusual or particularly onerous requests, paid a reasonable access fee.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the personal information which we have previously collected from you is out of date or incorrect, you can contact our Privacy Officer to arrange an amendment to our records.</p>
<h2>Internet users: what are “cookies” and how do we use them?</h2>
<p>A “cookie” is a small data file stored on your computer. We place a unique identifier in the cookie and use the cookie to connect your computer with the information we store for you in our database. Some examples of the data we store in our database includes your account preferences, items added to your shopping bag, user-specific information on pages accessed, and previous visits to our site. Your information is stored in a safe and secure database. We do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer.</p>
<p>If you are having difficulty completing your online order with us, please check your privacy settings in your browser. If you do not wish to change your privacy settings to “Medium” and you are currently using the “Medium High” or “High” settings, you may choose to override your current cookie handling practices for individual sites that you specify, including cottonon.com.</p>
<h2>How to report fraud</h2>
<p>You can help us identify attempts at fraud. We will never ask you for sensitive personal information in an email. If you receive a suspicious email appearing to come from us, such as one requesting that you confirm personal information like your credit card number, or if you have received an email implying that it has been sent by us after you have opted out of receipt of emails from us, you may forward the suspicious email to our Privacy Officer. You should not respond directly to suspicious email nor should you open any link in the email.</p>
<p>There are a few common features of fraudulent emails that can help you identify them as spam. The two most frequent are:</p>
<ol>
<li>receiving an email that contains mistakes such as misspelled words or grammatical errors; and</li>
<li>receiving an email that asks for your confidential information or asks you to take immediate action on your account.</li>
</ol>
<p>We encourage all of our customers to protect themselves and their information.  You should not share your account information with any third party and you should measure that your system has adequate anti-virus and firewall installed.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that an individual is under the age of 13 and has submitted any information to this Website for any purpose without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her information from our files.</p>
<h2>International data transfers</h2>
<p>All information collected within and outside of Australia is stored in Australia and is not transferred outside of Australia.</p>
<h2>Other things to consider</h2>
<p>This Website contains links and references to external websites. Please be aware that we do not control external websites and that this Privacy Statement does not apply to such websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of every website that you visit. If you are unsure about the credentials of a particular website, we recommend that you do not provide personal information to or through that website.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement is subject to change without notice. Please check this web page regularly to access the most current version of our Privacy Statement.</p>
<h2>Contacting Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, please contact our Privacy Officer.</p>
