identifiable information and honor your requests for privacy. This notice
describes our online privacy policy and practices, including what information we
collect and how we use it.<br>
By visiting any of our various brand sites, you are accepting the practices
described in this Privacy Notice. Unless you tell us otherwise, whenever you
submit personally identifiable information to us online, you are giving your
consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, as
described herein.<br>

We are also interested in making your visits to our websites useful and
enjoyable. We try to customize your website experience in a way that is tailored
to your unique interests. At the same time, we give you options to assist us in
customizing your visits. This is accomplished through our <a class="blue" href="http://sampollnet.coty.com/ScentStrip" target="_blank"><u>Beauty

</p><p><span class="dek"><b><u>What Personal Information Does Coty Gather?</u></b></span><br>
The information Coty learns from customers helps us continually improve the
services we provide to you. Here are the types of information we gather.
</p><ul>
  <li><span class="dek"><b><u>Information You Give Us</u></b>:</span> Coty
    receives and stores any information you enter on our Web sites or give us in
    any other way. However, you can choose not to provide certain information.
    However, if you do so, then you might not be able to take full advantage of
    many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such
    purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits based on
    your interests, awarding prizes for sweepstakes/contests, improving our
    service and communicating more effectively with you.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li><span class="dek"><b><u>Automatic Information</u></b>:</span> Coty
    receives and stores certain types of information automatically whenever you
    interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use �cookies.� In
    that way, we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser
    accesses our site. There are a number of companies that offer utilities
    designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although Coty will not be
    able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize
    you, you should be aware that these disabling tools exist.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span class="dek"><b><u>What Are Cookies?</u></b></span>
<ul>
  <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that Coty transfers to your
    computer�s hard drive through your Web browser. They enable our systems to
    recognize your browser. If we recognize you, Coty can provide more
    customized or personalized features each time you log on to one of our brand
    websites.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>The �help� portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how
    to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
    notify you when you receive a new cookie, and/or how to disable cookies
    altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our
    sites� features. Coty recommends that you leave them turned on.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>It is possible that some of Coty�s business partners may also use
    cookies on our websites. However, Coty has no access to, or control over,
    these cookies. Therefore, we do not accept any responsibility for such use.</li>
</ul>
<span class="dek"><b><u>What About Pixel Tags?</u></b></span><br>
When you visit Coty�s websites or view one of our e-mails, we may use pixel
tags (also called �clear gifs�), tracking links and/or similar technology to
note some of the pages you visit on our websites. These help us personalize your
experience. We may also use pixel tags to determine what types of e-mail your
browser supports. Coty may use the information collected through pixel tags,
tracking links and similar technology in combination with your personally
identifiable information.
<p><span class="dek"><br>
<b><u>Safeguards Concerning The Use Of Your Personal Information</u></b></span>
</p><ul>
  <li>Coty does <u>not</u> read your private online communications.<br>
  </li><li>Coty does <u>not</u> use any information about where you personally go on
    the Web and we do not give it out to others.<br>
  </li><li>Coty does <u>not</u> give out your personally identifiable information
    such as telephone number, credit card information or screen names. Coty also
    gives you the opportunity to correct your personal contact and other
    personally identifiable information that you have provided to us at any
    time.<br>
  </li><li>Coty may use information about the kinds of products you buy to make other
    marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to by opting-out via email
    or through your Beauty Pass registration.<br>
    <br>
    Coty, via your <a class="blue" href="http://sampollnet.coty.com/ScentStrip" target="_blank"><u>Beauty
    Pass</u></a> registration, gives you choices about how your personal
    information is used.<br>
  </li><li>The information you provide may be used by Coty to create and deliver to
    you newsletters, e-mails, surveys or other communications containing product
    information, offers, sweepstakes, contest information, promotions or
    information concerning your order.<br>
  </li><li>Coty may use the information you provide in an aggregate form for internal
    business and planning purposes, such as generating demographic data and
    statistics or developing marketing plans.<br>
  </li><li>Coty may collect, store and accumulate certain non-personally identifiable
    information concerning your use of our websites, such as information
    regarding which of our pages, brand sites, contests or promotions are most
    popular. Coty may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable
    information with or to our affiliates, licensees or partners.<br>
    <br>
    Coty may disclose information, including personally identifiable
    information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any
    applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Coty, as
    a rule, does not itself conduct direct sales of our products online;
    however, in the event of any on-line purchases, Coty may exchange
    information, including personally identifiable information, with other
    companies and organizations to process or fulfill orders submitted by you
    and for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.<br>
  </li><li>Coty may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our websites,
    track traffic patterns and gather demographic information for aggregate use.</li>
</ul>
<span class="dek"><b><u>Do We Share the Information We Receive?</u></b></span><br>
Information about our customers is an important part of Coty�s business.
However, Coty is <u>not</u> in the business of selling our database to others.
We share customer information only with subsidiaries we control, affiliates or
specific business partners or agents and only as described below.
<ul>
  <li><span class="dek"><b><u>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</u></b>:</span>
    Coty works closely with other business partners including our licensors such
    as adidas and our Sony/Epic affiliation. In some cases, these businesses
    operate stores or separate websites linked to our websites or will want to
    send offerings to you, but only when you tell us/them to by opting to
    receive partner information. You can tell when another business/partner is
    involved in a promotion and we only share customer information with that
    business when you tell us by opting-in.<br>
    <br>
