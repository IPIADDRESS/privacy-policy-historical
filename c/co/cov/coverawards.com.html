However, if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Because coverawards.com’s policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by coverawards.com of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, coverawards.com does not have to provide you with such lists.<strong> </strong>If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to:</p>
