As a user of this Internet Website (“Site”), you ("you" or "user") are valued by Covidien. Covidien is committed to protecting the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") provided by and collected from you on this Site in connection with the functions, facilities and services offered on this Site.</p><div class="section1">
<h2><span>What Personal Information Does Covidien Collect From Site Users?</span></h2>
<p>We may gather Personal Information so that we can improve and personalize your experience with Covidien. Personal Information that we collect falls into the following primary categories. We may receive Personal Information that you enter into the Site, provide in an online form, or provide in any other way. You can choose not to provide some or all of the Personal Information we ask for, but this may prevent you from using some of our Site's features, such as on-line educational course credit. </p>
<p>In addition to the preceding categories of Personal Information, Covidien also collects certain non-identifiable information (the "Non-Identifiable Information"). Whenever you interact with Covidien, we receive and store certain types of Non-Identifiable Information. For example, we may use "cookies" to obtain information when your web browser accesses this Site. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your computer via your Web browser and store on your computer's hard drive. The cookie file allows us to recognize your computer when you visit our Site. On most web browsers you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie, and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they may enable you to take advantage of some of our Site's best features.</p>
</div><div class="section2">
<h2><span>How Do We Use Your Personal Information And Other Non-Identifiable Information?</span></h2>
<p>Covidien uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use it in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. If you contact us about a job listing, we may use your Personal Information to consider you for the position. Covidien also uses your Personal Information and other Non-Identifiable Information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services. Covidien may also use your Personal Information to contact you, electronically or otherwise, in the future to tell you about products or services we believe will be of interest to you or to make it easier for you to use our site. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications.</p>
</div><div class="section3">
<h2><span>Does Covidien Share The Information It Receives?</span></h2>
<p>We are not in the business of selling information about our users. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with our customers and we treat it with great care and respect. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties, as set forth below.</p>
<p>Marketing: We may use any statements that you communicate to us through the Site regarding Covidien or any of our products and services for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Agents: Covidien, like many companies, may hire other companies to perform certain functions, such as mailing communications, sending e-mail and managing databases. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the Personal Information they need to complete the task and we endeavor to prohibit them from using that Personal Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, Personal Information may be one of the transferred business assets.</p>
<p>Protection of Covidien and Others: We may release account and other Personal information when we believe that such release is appropriate to comply with legal requirements, protect the rights, property or safety of our users, Covidien or others, or enforce terms of our Legal Statements. In addition, we may exchange information with other organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction.</p>
<p>Public Areas: Any submissions that you make to Public Areas will be considered public. Covidien does not control, and is not responsible for, the actions of other users of the Site with respect to any information you post in Public Areas. In addition, information that you submit to Public Areas may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes.</p>
</div><div class="section4">
<h2><span>How Secure Is Information About Me?</span></h2>
<p>Covidien uses reasonable measures to protect the Personal Information you provide to the Site from unauthorized access, deletion or alteration. However, the security of the Internet cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, you should not provide any confidential information to this Site.</p>

<h2><span>Access To Information About You.</span></h2>
<p>If you desire to review your own Personal information, to correct existing information, or to remove your information, please <a target="_blank" class="link2" href="mailto: corporate.communications@covidien.com">contact us</a>. If you request removal of your Personal Information, you acknowledge that residual information may continue to reside in Covidien's records and archives, but Covidien will not use that information for commercial purposes. Covidien reserves the right to maintain your Personal Information if Covidien has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to our Site for violating terms of the Legal Statements, which are hereby incorporated by reference.  </p>
</div><div class="section6">
<h2><span>What Choices Do I Have?</span></h2>
<p>With the exception of Personal Information required to uniquely identify a user, such as for student identification for an on-line course credit, you can choose not to provide Personal Information. However, doing so may prevent you from accessing other valuable features at our Site.</p>
</div><div class="section7">
<h2><span>Links To Third Party Sites</span></h2>
<p>You may be able to access Internet Websites owned by third parties (“Third Party Sites”) available through links from this Site.

<h2><span>Children</span></h2>
<p>Covidien does not knowingly collect Personal Information from minor children.

</div><div class="section9">
<h2><span>Terms Of Use, Notices, And Revisions</span></h2>

<h2><span>Safe Harbor  (Employment Data)</span></h2>
<p>Covidien is committed to protecting the Personal Information provided by and collected from our employees.

</div><div class="section12">
<h2><span>Choice</span></h2>
<p>Covidien will give employees the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Information will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the employee.  For sensitive information, affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice will be given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the employee.</p>
</div><div class="section13">
<h2><span>Onward Transfer (Transfers to Third Parties)</span></h2>
<p>Covidien may disclose employee data to third parties for the purpose of providing employment related services (such as payroll processing, benefits administration, insurance, training and career development).  Covidien will take reasonable steps to ensure that the third party will provide the same level of protection as required by the Safe Harbor Principles.  If the third party does not comply, then Covidien will take reasonable steps to stop or prevent the processing of Personal Information.</p>
</div><div class="section14">
<h2><span>Access</span></h2>
