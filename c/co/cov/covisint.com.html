<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

This Privacy Policy <em><strong>(the "Policy")</strong></em> sets forth Compuware Corporation's <em><strong>("Compuware" or  "Covisint")</strong></em> policies regarding the collection and use of  information relating to the Covisint Web site <em><strong>(the "Web Site")</strong></em> and the Covisint Exchange <em><strong>(the "Exchange")</strong></em>. The  Exchange is only accessible by registered Members of the Exchange  ("Members") and their authorized users <em><strong>("Authorized  Users")</strong></em>; the Web Site is generally accessible by all others who  visit the Web Site <em><strong>("Visitors")</strong></em>. With respect to  Members and their Authorized Users, the applicable Product Agreement or Product  Addenda may specify certain additional rights and obligations regarding the  collection of data. 

<p>INFORMATION COLLECTION  AND USE<strong> </strong><br>
<strong>General</strong><br>
Visitors, Members and Authorized Users understand and agree that Covisint may  collect, maintain, and process information provided by such parties to  Covisint, and information collected by Covisint concerning such Visitors,  Members and Authorized Users, on and through the Web Site and the Exchange.  Visitors, Members and Authorized Users represent and warrant that all  information they provide to Covisint is true, accurate, current,  non-misleading, and consistent and relevant for the purpose for which such  information is provided. Members and Authorized Users also represent and  warrant that they have the authority to provide the information submitted to  and through the Exchange, and understand and agree that Covisint may from time  to time verify such authority. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Public Areas of the Web  Site</strong><br>
Visitors  may visit the public (non-Exchange) areas of the Web Site without disclosing  any personally identifiable information about themselves. However, Visitors  will have the opportunity to request information from Covisint, in which case  an email or other address may be required in order to allow Covisint to comply  with the request, and for other purposes as may be disclosed at the time the  request is made (<em>"Special Purpose Collection"</em>). Visitors may elect  to opt-out from receiving communications other than those relating to the  Special Purpose Collection by (a) following the instructions in the section  titled <em><strong>OPT-OUT CHOICES</strong></em>, below, (b) checking  appropriate opt-in or opt-out boxes which may be provided on the collection  form, or (c) as set forth in the communication sent from Covisint. Covisint  will not request more information than is reasonably necessary to provide  requested information or services. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Exchange </strong><br>
<em>Registration Information</em><br>
In order to participate in the Exchange, Covisint requires Members and  Authorized Users to register with the Exchange by, among other things,  providing contact information including Password and User ID, name, title,  department, business address, business telephone number, business email address  and other contact information (<em><strong>"Registration Information"</strong></em>).  Such information will typically be provided to Covisint by the Member's  Administrator. Certain portions of the Registration Information concerning the  Member (and not an individual Authorized User) will be used for evaluating  qualifications for participation in the Exchange. Registration Information  concerning individual Authorized Users may be made available to other Members,  in the form of contact directories maintained on the Exchange, in order to  facilitate the operation of the Exchange. Covisint may also use Registration  Information to communicate with Members and Authorized Users regarding  available transactions, changes in Exchange functionality, features, billing, help  desk and other activities relating to the operation of the Exchange. Covisint  may also use Registration Information to send Members and Authorized Users  information about products or services available on or through the Exchange and  offers made available by Covisint's business partners, which may be sent by  Covisint or the Covisint business partner making the offer. Instructions on how  to request that Covisint not send future communications (except for  communications necessary for the operation of the Exchange) or that Covisint  not share Registration Information with Other Members or third parties, are set  forth in the section titled <em><strong>OPT-OUT CHOICES</strong></em> below and, for  Covisint-transmitted material which is unrelated to the operation of the  Exchange, in each communication. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Usage Data</strong><br>
Covisint  will record and collect information about how Visitors, Members and Authorized  Users use the Web Site, and in the case of Members and Authorized Users, the  Exchange. This data may include, a Visitor's, Member's or Authorized User's  domain name, language, type of browser and operating system, Internet Service  Provider, Internet protocol (IP) address, the Web site from which Visitors,  Members or Authorized Users arrived at the Web Site or the Exchange, and the  amount of time spent on the Web Site or using the Exchange (collectively, <em>"Usage  Data"</em>). Covisint may monitor and use Usage Data in aggregated form to  measure the Web Site's performance and Exchange activity and improve the Web  Site's or Exchange's design and functionality. Covisint may also use Usage Data  in aggregated form to develop and distribute to third parties statistical and  general information about how the Web Site and Exchange are used and for other  marketing purposes. Covisint may also use Usage Data in unaggregated form to  investigate and prosecute security violations or to identify a particular  Authorized User who engaged in a particular transaction on behalf of a Member  in the event there is a repudiation of such transaction by such Member. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Covisint  may use "cookies" to make transactions and other activities through  the Web Site and the Exchange more convenient and efficient for Visitors,  Members and Authorized Users. For these purposes, Covisint may use  "session cookies," which consist of information stored in a browser's  memory and passed back to the applicable server whenever a request for a new  page on the Web Site or the Exchange is made. The session cookie is never saved  nor written to disk, and the information contained in the session cookie is  only valid for that one particular session. The session cookie is discarded  when the browser is closed or, in the case of a Member or Authorized User, upon  logging out of the Exchange. Most Web browsers automatically accept session  cookies, and most may also be configured to provide notice of when a session  cookie is about to be placed on the browser. No information is saved in such  session cookies other than an identification number associated with the  particular session. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Forums</strong><br>
Covisint  may make available certain public forums such as bulletin boards or chat rooms  (collectively, <em>"Forums"</em>) on the Web Site or the Exchange. Use  of any Forum is subject to Covisint's Exchange Rules, <a href="/legal.shtml">Terms of Use</a>, and any other notice or  policy applicable to a particular Forum or all Forums collectively. Any and all  information posted on or through a Forum will be generally accessible for  viewing by others. Accordingly, participants are encouraged to exercise  discretion when using Forums.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>OPT-OUT CHOICES</strong><br>
To "opt-out" of (1) receiving communications from Covisint (except for  communications necessary for the operation of the Web Site or the Exchange),  (2) having contact information disclosed to third parties (except as necessary  for Covisint to operate the Web Site and Exchange, or as otherwise permitted  under this Policy), or (3) any other consent previously granted for a specific  purpose concerning your personally identifiable information, send an email to  Covisint at <a href="mailto:businessnow@covisint.com">businessnow@covisint.com</a>.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>REVIEW/CHANGE CONTACT INFORMATION</strong><br>
Requests  to review or change information previously provided on or through the Web Site  or the Exchange may be made to Covisint by sending an email to the Covisint  Data Controller. Requests for changes to the Registration Information should be  made by Authorized Users directly to their Administrators.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>LINKED SITES/THIRD PARTY SITES</strong><br>
Web  sites (<em>"Linked Sites"</em>) from the Web Site or the Exchange.  Linked Sites are not reviewed, controlled or examined by Covisint in any way  and Covisint is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any  such Linked Sites, or any additional links contained therein. These links do  not imply Covisint's endorsement of or association with the Linked Sites.  Visitors, Members and Authorized Users should refer to the policies posted by  such Linked Sites regarding data collection, privacy and other topics before  accesing them. Covisint may refer to or list third parties on the Web Site or  the Exchange who maintain separate web sites. Visitors, Members and Authorized  Users should refer to the policies posted by such third parties on their web  sites regarding data collection, privacy and other topics before accesing them.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO LAW</strong><br>
Covisint  may make information concerning Visitors, Members, Authorized Users, the Web  Site and the Exchange, and the uses thereof, available to law enforcement  personnel and agencies as required by law. Where permitted by law, Covisint may  also disclose such information to law enforcement personnel and agencies, or  use such information as part of legal process, in order to protect its property  or in furtherance of an investigation regarding a breach of the Web Site or  Exchange's rules and policies, or any unauthorized access to or use of the Web  Site or the Exchange, or any illegal activities concerning a particular  Visitor, Member or Authorized User.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>CONSENT TO PROCESSING</strong><br>
By  using or providing information to the Web Site and the Exchange, Members and  Visitors understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, processing and  use of such information in the United States and other countries and  territories, for the purposes set forth in this Policy and, for Members and  Authorized Users, as further set forth in their applicable Product Agreement or  Product Addenda. As required to comply with privacy laws applicable to Member  and/or its Authorized Users, Member agrees that it has obtained, or prior to  disclosure to Covisint will obtain, consent from each of its Authorized Users  to: (a) permit Member to transfer personally-identifiable information regarding  the Authorized Users to Covisint; (b) the terms of this Policy; and (c) permit  Covisint to collect, process and disclose such personally-identifiable  information regarding the Authorized Users: (i) in order to provide the  Services and perform its obligations as described in the any applicable Product  Agreements or Product Addenda entered into by Member, (ii) to operate the  Exchange (including but not limited to disclosure to other Members of the  Exchange in the normal course of such operation) or (iii) as otherwise  permitted under this Policy, including but not limited to the transfer of such  personally-identifiable information between Covisint's subsidiaries and  affiliates for the foregoing objectives. For further certainty, any consent  relating to a right to transfer information referred to in the foregoing shall  be deemed to include the consent of Authorized Users to the transfer of the applicable  personally identifiable information to a jurisdiction which may have a  different level of privacy protection than that applicable in the Authorized  User's country.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>SERVICES PROVIDERS</strong><br>
Covisint  may utilize third parties to provide or perform certain services and functions  on the Web Site and the Exchange. For example, Covisint may use a Web site  tracking evaluation firm to analyze Visitors', Members' and Authorized Users'  use of the Web Site and the Exchange, as applicable. Covisint may use third party  suppliers to directly provide certain functionality provided on the Exchange  (through a browser re-direction to systems operated by such third party  suppliers). Covisint may also outsource certain fulfillment or communication  functions, such as transaction clearing, shipping, and electronic  correspondence, to third parties. Covisint will make information concerning  Visitors, Members and Authorized Users and their use of the Web Site and  Exchange available to these service providers, as necessary, to perform these  functions. Any access to such information will be limited to the purpose for  which such information was provided to the service provider. The service  providers may be located throughout the world. Accordingly, information  relating to Visitors, Members and Authorized Users may be sent worldwide to  countries which have a different level of privacy protection than the US or a  Visitor's, Member's or Authorized User's country of residence.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
In  the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, or sale or transfer of  the substantial assets of Covisint, information collected about Visitors,  Members and Authorized Users may be sold, assigned, or transferred to a party  acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of Covisint in  order to permit such party to continue the operation of the Web Site or the  Exchange. Covisint may also transfer information collected about Visitors,  Members and Authorized Users to its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the  Covisint Group (as applicable), that are directly involved in the operation of  the Exchange.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
Covisint  takes seriously the security of the information it collects. Covisint has  therefore implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to  reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized  disclosure or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the level  of the data concerned.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
Covisint may, in its sole discretion, update this Policy at any time and from  time to time, by posting the amended Policy on the Web Site and the Exchange.  Such amended Policy shall be effective upon posting. Visitors, Members and  Authorized Users are therefore encouraged to refer back to this page regularly.  This Policy may not be otherwise amended without the written consent of  Covisint.
