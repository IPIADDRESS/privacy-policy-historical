					</p>
					<p><strong>Internet Aspects: </strong>
					</p>
					<p>Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities on or 
						related to all websites of Covers Media Group Ltd. (see "Covers Media Group Ltd. Companies 
						Sites") or related to services made available on the Covers Media Group Ltd.
						Companies Sites. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the 
						Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and 
						to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. provides the details below about Internet aspects of 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. services for the purposes of disclosure.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) </strong>
						<br>
						When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the 
						Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send 
						the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most 
						users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), 
						the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.
						<br>
						Covers Media Group Ltd. may use the user's IP Address to:
					</p>
					<p>a) Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the 
						user's or Covers Media Group Ltd's technical team.
					</p>
					<p>b) Display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more 
						appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and 
						advertising based on the user's geographic area.
					</p>
					<p>c) Estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP 
						addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, 
						universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. 
						Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to 
						advertisers.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Cookies </strong>
						<br>
						A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique 
						identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a web site's computers 
						and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to 
						run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.
						<br>
						Covers Media Group Ltd. may use cookies to:
					</p>
					<p>a) Improve the operation and performance of the Covers Media Group Ltd. services and 
						to make Covers Media Group Ltd. services easier and more convenient to use. For 
						example, cookies help Covers Media Group Ltd. provide more personalized services by 
						recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). 
						Cookies also allow Covers Media Group Ltd. to save passwords and preferences for a 
						user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. website;
					</p>
					<p>b) Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. websites and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average 
						time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. to better understand when to update, change or offer new 
						services and provides Covers Media Group Ltd. with details as to the performance of 
						Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in 
						aggregate form only, to Covers Media Group Ltd's current and prospective sponsors, 
						advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in 
						such reports;
					</p>
					<p>c) Display advertisements. Covers Media Group Ltd. and Third Party advertising 
						providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Covers Media Group Ltd. 
						websites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are 
						delivered to users (in conjunction with Covers Media Group Ltd. services) by such 
						Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on 
						their behalf, and not by Covers Media Group Ltd.; as such, the Third-party 
						advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies 
						of such Third Party advertisers.
					</p>
					<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the 
						user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has 
						received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand 
						that while Covers Media Group Ltd. do not require a user to use cookies, certain 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. services will not function properly if a user sets his/her 
						browser to not accept cookies.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Links To Other Sites And Advertisements </strong>
						<br>
						A Covers Media Group Ltd. website may contain links to other websites and services. 
						While Covers Media Group Ltd. try to link only to sites and services that share 
						Covers Media Group Ltd's high standards and respect for privacy, a user should 
						understand that Covers Media Group Ltd. is not responsible for the content of, or the 
						privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Covers Media Group
						Ltd. Privacy Policy applies only to the Covers Media Group Ltd. services related to 
						this Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<p>The majority of the advertisements which are displayed in connection with 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. services are served through one or more reputable Third Party 
						advertisement-serving companies which deliver the advertisements to users in 
						conjunction with Covers Media Group Ltd. services. For more information about what 
						information is collected and how information is used by a major Third Party 
						advertising provider click here.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Additional Information </strong>
						<br>
						Covers Media Group Ltd. Companies automatically collect certain information about the 
						user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser 
						type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site 
						addresses. This information is used by Covers Media Group Ltd. to operate the 
						service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general 
						statistics regarding use of the Covers Media Group Ltd. Companies Sites.
					</p>
					<p>Certain Covers Media Group Ltd. services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction 
						with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. and the other company may receive information collected in 
						conjunction with the co-branded services.

						to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to 
						Covers Media Group Ltd. products and services;

					<p>iii) If a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a Covers Media Group
					    Ltd. website, Covers Media Group Ltd. may, under the rules of the promotion, use the 
						Person's name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such 
						as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion.
					</p>
					<p>Further references to "identified purposes" mean the purposes identified in this 
						Principle 2.
					</p>
					<p>2.2 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the 
						identified purposes to the Person at or before the time Personal Information is 
						collected. Upon request, persons collecting Personal Information shall explain

					</p>
					<p>2.3 Unless required by law, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall not use or disclose, for any

					</p>
					<p><strong>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of 
							Personal Information </strong>
						<br>
					</p>
					<p>The knowledge and consent of a Person are required for the collection, use or 
						disclosure of Personal Information, except where inappropriate.
					</p>
					<p>3.1 Generally, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall seek consent to use and disclose Personal 
						Information at the same time it collects the information. However, Covers Media Group
						Ltd. may seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information after it has 
						been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.
					</p>
					<p>3.2 In obtaining consent, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall use reasonable efforts to 
						ensure that a Person is advised of the identified purposes for which Personal

						into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable

						contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may contact

					<p>3.7 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected, used or 
						disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Person. For example,

						obtained in a timely way, such as when the Person is a minor, seriously ill or 
						mentally incapacitated.
					</p>
					<p>Covers Media Group Ltd. may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without 
						knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat the 
						purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach 
						of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.
					</p>
					<p>Covers Media Group Ltd. may also use or disclose Personal Information without 
						knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or

						which is necessary for the purposes identified by Covers Media Group Ltd..
					</p>
					<p>Covers Media Group Ltd. shall collect Personal Information by fair and lawful means.
					</p>
					<p>4.1 Covers Media Group Ltd. collects Personal Information primarily from Individuals.
					</p>
					<p>4.2 Covers Media Group Ltd. may also collect Personal Information from other sources 
						including credit bureaus, employers or personal references, or other third 
						parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the information.

						<br>
					</p>
					<p>Covers Media Group Ltd. shall not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes 
						other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the 
						Person or as required by law. Covers Media Group Ltd. shall retain Personal 
						Information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for

					<p>5.2 In addition, Covers Media Group Ltd. may disclose a Person's Personal Information 
						to:
						<br>
						a) Another person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of 
						any of the products or services of Covers Media Group Ltd.;
						<br>
						b) A person who, in the reasonable judgment of the Covers Media Group Ltd., is 
						seeking the information as an agent of the Person;
						<br>
						c) Any Covers Media Group Ltd. to permit the provision of services requested by the 
						Person, and
						<br>
						d) A Third Party or Third Parties, where the Person consents to such disclosure 
						or disclosure is required by law.

					<p>5.4 Only those Employees of Covers Media Group Ltd. who require access for business 
						reasons, or whose duties reasonably so require, or properly designated 
						representatives of Covers Media Group Ltd., are granted access to Personal 
						Information about Individuals.
					</p>
					<p>5.5 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall keep Personal Information only as long as it remains 
						necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. 
						Depending on the circumstances, where Personal Information has been used to 
						make a decision about a Person, Covers Media Group Ltd. shall retain, for a period of 
						time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the Person, either 
						the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.
					</p>
					<p>5.6 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, 
						schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction 
						which apply to Personal Information that is no longer necessary or relevant for

						Information and to authorize access to the individual's file. Any such 
						information shall be used only for this purpose.
					</p>
					<p>9.5 Covers Media Group Ltd. shall promptly correct or complete any Personal 
						Information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as
