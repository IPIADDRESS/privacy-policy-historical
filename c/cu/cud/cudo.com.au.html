<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">CUDO may use your personal information for a variety of purposes in connection with providing you with Coupons (and information on opportunities to purchase Coupons), CUDO’s products and services and special offers available to CUDO members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">In general, CUDO uses personal information for the following purposes:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to provide offers to persons who register an Account to receive information on opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons ;</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to provide other products or services which are requested from CUDO, including advertising services;</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to process and administer our dealings with you;</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to develop processes, products and services to better meet your needs;</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to help CUDO manage and enhance its products and services and the opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons;</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• unless requested not to, to communicate with you regarding opportunities to purchase Vouchers for products and services promoted by us via the Getaway Lounge website (www.getawaylounge,com.au);</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to communicate with online users of opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• unless requested not to, to send you marketing materials which promote the goods or services of a third party (including by way of electronic direct marketing activities)</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• to provide people with ongoing information and advertising about CUDO's products and services in which they may have an interest; and</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">• unless requested not to, CUDO may provide your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">In many cases where CUDO asks you to provide CUDO with personal information, if you do not provide CUDO with that personal information CUDO will not be able to provide you with the relevant product or service.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">If you have opted in to receive newsletters, communications or special offers from CUDO you may, in some circumstances, also receive newsletters, communications or special offers from the third party (including the Merchant) providing the Deal. You can change your preference to receive communications from CUDO re opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons or CUDO Newsletters at any time. If you are contacted by a third party, that third party’s opt out of receiving further communications will be governed by their privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Secure Online Transactions<br> </strong><br> If you purchase a Coupon through our website, we process your credit card details securely over the Internet using eWAY’s bank-grade data centre (eWAY is an accredited Internet payment security system authorised as a third party processor for all major Australian banks). With the combination of transaction performed under 128 Bit SSL Certificate on our website and a secure browser at your end, we take all measures to ensure that your credit card and anonymity are protected when you purchase online.<br> <br> <strong>Links to Third Party Websites from CUDO Websites</strong><br> <br> CUDO operates one main website in relation to its products and services and general business. To the extent that CUDO contains links to sites operated by third parties and not related to CUDO products, services or events (“Linked Websites”), the Linked Websites are not controlled by CUDO. We may collect personal information from the CUDO Website and Linked Websites in our role as website portal. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those companies. Before disclosing your personal information to Linked Websites, we advise you to examine their privacy policies.<br> <br> <strong>Third Party Advertisements Online</strong><br> <br> To try and identify Coupons that may be of interest to you, CUDO has relationships with other companies that we allow to place advertisements on our web pages. If you visit our website, advertisement server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. <br> <br> <strong>Redeeming Coupons with Merchants</strong><br> <br> When you purchase a Coupon, CUDO may need to forward your name and contact information to the relevant Merchant in order to redeem the Coupon to receive the Deal or you may be required to provide your personal information to the relevant Merchant at the time you redeem your Coupon. In those instances, your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy of the relevant Merchant.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU;">Also, with your consent, CUDO may pass your personal information on to Merchants from whom you have received a Deal, so that the Merchant can keep you informed of future events/offers they may be providing. If you are required to make a booking with a Merchant in order to redeem your Coupon, you may be asked at the time of that booking if you would like to receive this information. You may change your preference at any time directly with the Merchant which has collected your personal information. If you do not have the Merchant’s contact details you may contact our Privacy Officer directly.<br>&nbsp;<br></span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU;"><strong></strong></span></p>

CUDO may provide your personal information to:<br> • organisations who are sponsoring, organising or otherwise involved with or participating in a Deal (including Merchants) and other promotion, competition or survey; <br> • other companies or individuals CUDO engages to perform functions on behalf of CUDO such as for production functions, processing credit card information, mailing of information or gifts/ offers/ prizes, printing functions, data analysis, data washing, telemarketing, research, and advertising; and <br> • anyone you authorise CUDO to disclose personal information to. <br> CUDO may decide to buy or sell assets which form part of or relate to its business. In any such transaction, personal information will usually be one of the transferred assets and will be disclosed to the purchaser.<br> Where we disclose personal information to third party contractors, agents or related companies, we take steps to ensure that those agents, contractors or related third parties:<br> • comply with the NPPs when they handle personal information about you (regardless of whether they are a small business and would otherwise be exempt from the NPPs); and <br> • are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions we require. <br> Otherwise, we only disclose personal information if required or permitted to do so by law or if the disclosure is permitted under the Privacy Act.<br> <br> <strong>How does CUDO treat Sensitive Information?</strong><br> <br> In referring to 'sensitive information' CUDO means information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies, religions, trade unions or other professional or trade association, sexual preferences, criminal record and health information.<br> If you decide to provide CUDO with sensitive information, it is CUDO’ policy that this information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose, unless you agree otherwise or use or disclosure of this information is allowed by law.<br> <br> <strong>Management and security of personal information<br> </strong><br> We take physical, electronic and managerial steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is secure from unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. We only permit your details to be accessed by authorised personnel and we educate our staff about their responsibilities under the NPPs. CUDO has also appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee CUDO’s management of personal information in accordance with this policy and the Commonwealth Privacy Act.<br> <br> Additionally, we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it. We also impose strict requirements of security and confidentially on all third parties as to how they store, handle and deal with personal information. <br> In striving to ensure that the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our site is maintained to the highest level, CUDO regularly reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and you need to be aware of this when using our website.<br> <br> <strong>Anonymous transactions </strong><br> <br> Where it is lawful and practicable to do so, customers may transact with CUDO without providing personal information. However, if we do not collect personal information about you at (without limitation) the point of a sale, transaction, registration of interest, registration for offer we will not be able to contact you in the case of an change in offer, event cancellation, venue change, cease of offer for example.<br> <br> <strong>Non-customer information</strong> <br> <br> Sometimes, CUDO needs to collect personal information about individuals who are not Account holders or customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in a government agency or company with whom we deal. CUDO's policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers for the main business purpose for which it was collected.<br> <br> <strong>Transborder data flows<br> </strong><br> Some of CUDO’s third party contractors and service providers may perform some of their services overseas. For instance, a third party contractor may utilise a server hosted overseas as a method to send emails to CUDO customers. In all instances where this occurs, CUDO takes reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information is handled in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.<br> <br> <strong>Updating Personal Information</strong><br> <br> CUDO endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date. CUDO encourages you to contact it as soon as possible in order to update any personal information it holds about you. CUDO's contact details are set out below.<br> <br> You have the right to check what Personal Information CUDO holds about you<br> <br> Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to obtain access to any personal information which CUDO holds about you and to advise CUDO of any perceived inaccuracy. There are some limitations to this right set out in the Act, which mean that we can refuse to provide you access to that information in limited circumstances, including where granting you access might have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals, if the request is frivolous or vexatious; and if the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings.<br> <br> To make a request to access any personal information CUDO holds about you, please contact CUDO in writing as set out below. CUDO will require you to verify your identity and specify what personal information you require. CUDO may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying your application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material requested. If the personal information sought is extensive, CUDO will advise of the likely cost in advance and can help to refine your request if required.</span></p>
