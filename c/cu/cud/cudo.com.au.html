        Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h1><strong>CUDO and Privacy</strong></h1>
<p><br>
At CUDO, we are committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy. As  part of our normal operations we may collect your personal information.  This Privacy Policy describes the type of personal information we may  collect and how we use, store and disclose this personal information.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to all websites relating to CUDO including  websites hosted by third parties, where those websites do not have their  own privacy policy.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to online privacy issues and therefore it is  to be read as forming part of the Terms &amp; Conditions of Use for our  website. When you deal with CUDO, whether online or otherwise, CUDO  takes its privacy obligations seriously. Generally, CUDO will handle  personal information collected online consistently with the way that it  handles personal information collected offline.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you as much as possible about  how CUDO uses and manages personal information provided to, or collected  by CUDO. We believe you should be made aware of our practices so you  can make informed decisions about how you allow us to use your personal  information.<br>
<br>
CUDO is bound by the National Privacy Principles (“NPPs”) contained in the Privacy Act 1998 (Cth) (the “Privacy Act”). <br>
In this ever changing world CUDO may, from time to time, review and  update this privacy policy to take account of new laws and technology  and changes to CUDOs operations. All personal information held by CUDO  will be governed by CUDO's most recent policy. The most recent Privacy  Policy will always be available on our website at  www.cudo.com.au/privacy or by contacting the CUDO Privacy Officer at the  address below.<br>
<br>
Any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or complaints regarding how  we handle your personal information should be sent to CUDO’s Privacy  Officer at Cudo.com.au Pty Ltd PO Box 40, Pyrmont, Sydney, New South  Wales.<br>
<br>
<strong>What kind of personal information does CUDO collect and how does CUDO collect it?<br>
</strong><br>
The types of personal information we collect will vary depending on the  nature of your dealings with CUDO (our agents, contractors and third  parties). <br>
<br>
CUDO collects most information directly from you. Generally we collect  this information to provide you with a range of products and services  and so you can receive information on opportunities to purchase Coupons  and Coupons you have purchased, receive your purchased Coupon, receive  other special offers, join loyalty clubs, advertise on our website,  enquire about how you can become a CUDO Merchant , complete a survey or  questionnaire, enter a competition or register to attend an event, seek  employment, or communicate with CUDO by e-mail, telephone or in writing.<br>
<br>
We may also collect personal information to assist in identifying ways  in which CUDO can service you better, such as providing our products and  services to you more effectively, and to assist our internal  administration and operating including accounting, risk management,  record keeping, archiving and staff training. <br>
<br>
We may also collect personal information through:<br>
• third parties such as our related companies; <br>
• Merchants and other business partners who assist us provide CUDO’s products, offers and services; <br>
• data washing organisations; and <br>
• other websites that are maintained by CUDO but not owned by CUDO.<br>
<br>
Sometimes CUDO may be provided with personal information about an  individual from a third party, for example CUDO may obtain data from a  3rd party member club that we will use to provide a special offer or  service to those members and/or CUDO may obtain personal information  through social media forums/platforms that you sign up to and/or provide  CUDO permission to obtain in relation to the respective social media  forum guidelines and or conditions.<br>
<br>
In general, the type of personal information CUDO collects and holds  could include (but is not limited to) name, address (postal and email),  contact details, geographic location, gender, transaction details  relating to your use of CUDO’s products and services and any preferences  you tell us about.<br>
<br>
We may collect your personal information over the internet (including  when you create an Account), over the phone, when you write to us or  when you participate in a survey, questionnaire, competition or other  marketing campaign. <br>
<br>
<strong>How CUDO uses Personal Information<br>
</strong><br>
CUDO may use your personal information for a variety of purposes in  connection with providing you with Coupons (and information on  opportunities to purchase Coupons), CUDO’s products and services and  special offers available to CUDO members. <br>
<br>
In general, CUDO uses personal information for the following purposes:<br>
<br>
• to provide offers to persons who register an Account to receive information on opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons ; <br>
• to provide other products or services which are requested from CUDO, including advertising services; <br>
• to process and administer our dealings with you; <br>
• to develop processes, products and services to better meet your needs; <br>
• to help CUDO manage and enhance its products and services and the opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons; <br>
• to communicate with online users of opportunities to purchase CUDO Coupons <br>
• to provide people with ongoing information and advertising about  CUDO's products and services in which they may have an interest; and <br>
• unless requested not to, CUDO may provide your personal information to  third parties which may in turn provide your personal information to  other third parties for marketing purposes. <br>
<br>
In many cases where CUDO asks you to provide CUDO with personal  information, if you do not provide CUDO with that personal information  CUDO will not be able to provide you with the relevant product or  service.<br>
<br>
If you have opted in to receive newsletters, communications or special  offers from CUDO you may, in some circumstances, also receive  newsletters, communications or special offers from the third party  (including the Merchant) providing the Deal. You can change your  preference to receive communications from CUDO re opportunities to  purchase CUDO Coupons or CUDO Newsletters at any time. If you are  contacted by a third party, that third party’s opt out of receiving  further communications will be governed by their privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Secure Online Transactions<br>
</strong><br>
If you purchase a Coupon through our website, we process your credit  card details securely over the Internet using eWAY’s bank-grade data  centre (eWAY is an accredited Internet payment security system  authorised as a third party processor for all major Australian banks).  With the combination of transaction performed under 128 Bit SSL  Certificate on our website and a secure browser at your end, we take all  measures to ensure that your credit card and anonymity are protected  when you purchase online.<br>
<br>
<strong>Links to Third Party Websites from CUDO Websites</strong><br>
<br>
CUDO operates one main website in relation to its products and services  and general business. To the extent that CUDO contains links to sites  operated by third parties and not related to CUDO products, services or  events (“Linked Websites”), the Linked Websites are not controlled by  CUDO. We may collect personal information from the CUDO Website and  Linked Websites in our role as website portal. However, we are not  responsible for the privacy practices of those companies. Before  disclosing your personal information to Linked Websites, we advise you  to examine their privacy policies.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Advertisements Online</strong><br>
<br>
To try and identify Coupons that may be of interest to you, CUDO has  relationships with other companies that we allow to place advertisements  on our web pages. If you visit our website, advertisement server  companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP  address and clickstream information. <br>
<br>
<strong>Redeeming Coupons with Merchants</strong><br>
<br>
When you purchase a Coupon, CUDO may need to forward your name and  contact information to the relevant Merchant in order to redeem the  Coupon to receive the Deal or you may be required to provide your  personal information to the relevant Merchant at the time you redeem  your Coupon. In those instances, your personal information will be  governed by the privacy policy of the relevant Merchant.</p>
<p>Also, with your consent, CUDO may pass your personal information on  to Merchants from whom you have received a Deal, so that the Merchant  can keep you informed of future events/offers they may be providing. If  you are required to make a booking with a Merchant in order to redeem  your Coupon, you may be asked at the time of that booking if you would  like to receive this information. You may change your preference at any  time directly with the Merchant which has collected your personal  information. If you do not have the Merchant’s contact details you may  contact our Privacy Officer directly.<br>
<br>
<strong>Our Use of Cookies through CUDO Websites<br>
</strong><br>
CUDO Websites use cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a  website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping  purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you  do not wish to receive any cookies, you may set your browser to refuse  them. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full  advantage of parts of the CUDO Websites. <br>
The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what we offer, because  they help us personalise your experience of the CUDO Websites by  providing information which is most relevant to your interests. Cookies  provide us with aggregated information on how users interact on the CUDO  Websites, track which advertisements are effective and help us improve  your experience on our website. Cookies do not personally identify you,  but your browser. <br>
<br>
<strong>To whom might CUDO disclose Personal Information?</strong><br>
<br>
CUDO may disclose personal information it collects about you for a  variety of purposes in connection with CUDO providing its products and  service and special offers to you (including to our agents, contractors  or to a related company). CUDO may provide your personal information to:<br>
• organisations who are sponsoring, organising or otherwise involved  with or participating in a Deal (including Merchants) and other  promotion, competition or survey; <br>
• other companies or individuals CUDO engages to perform functions on  behalf of CUDO such as for production functions, processing credit card  information, mailing of information or gifts/ offers/ prizes, printing  functions, data analysis, data washing, telemarketing, research, and  advertising; and <br>
• anyone you authorise CUDO to disclose personal information to. <br>
CUDO may decide to buy or sell assets which form part of or relate to  its business. In any such transaction, personal information will usually  be one of the transferred assets and will be disclosed to the  purchaser.<br>
Where we disclose personal information to third party contractors,  agents or related companies, we take steps to ensure that those agents,  contractors or related third parties:<br>
• comply with the NPPs when they handle personal information about you  (regardless of whether they are a small business and would otherwise be  exempt from the NPPs); and <br>
• are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions we require. <br>
Otherwise, we only disclose personal information if required or  permitted to do so by law or if the disclosure is permitted under the  Privacy Act.<br>
<br>
<strong>How does CUDO treat Sensitive Information?</strong><br>
<br>
In referring to 'sensitive information' CUDO means information relating  to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies,  religions, trade unions or other professional or trade association,  sexual preferences, criminal record and health information.<br>
If you decide to provide CUDO with sensitive information, it is CUDO’  policy that this information will be used and disclosed only for the  purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary  purpose, unless you agree otherwise or use or disclosure of this  information is allowed by law.<br>
<br>
<strong>Management and security of personal information<br>
</strong><br>
We take physical, electronic and managerial steps to ensure that the  personal information we hold is secure from unauthorised access,  destruction, use, modification or disclosure. We only permit your  details to be accessed by authorised personnel and we educate our staff  about their responsibilities under the NPPs. CUDO has also appointed a  Privacy Officer to oversee CUDO’s management of personal information in  accordance with this policy and the Commonwealth Privacy Act.<br>
<br>
Additionally, we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently  de-identify personal information when we no longer need it. We also  impose strict requirements of security and confidentially on all third  parties as to how they store, handle and deal with personal information.  <br>
In striving to ensure that the security, integrity and privacy of  personal information submitted to our site is maintained to the highest  level, CUDO regularly reviews and updates its security measures in light  of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the  internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and you need to be aware  of this when using our website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Anonymous transactions </strong><br>
<br>
Where it is lawful and practicable to do so, customers may transact with  CUDO without providing personal information. However, if we do not  collect personal information about you at (without limitation) the point  of a sale, transaction, registration of interest, registration for  offer we will not be able to contact you in the case of an change in  offer, event cancellation, venue change, cease of offer for example.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Non-customer information</strong> <br>
<br>
Sometimes, CUDO needs to collect personal information about individuals  who are not Account holders or customers. This will usually arise where  we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the  contact in a government agency or company with whom we deal. CUDO's  policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers  for the main business purpose for which it was collected.<br>
<br>
<strong>Transborder data flows<br>
</strong><br>
Some of CUDO’s third party contractors and service providers may perform  some of their services overseas. For instance, a third party contractor  may utilise a server hosted overseas as a method to send emails to CUDO  customers. In all instances where this occurs, CUDO takes reasonable  steps to ensure that all personal information is handled in a manner  that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Updating Personal Information</strong><br>
<br>
CUDO endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is  accurate, complete and up-to-date. CUDO encourages you to contact it as  soon as possible in order to update any personal information it holds  about you. CUDO's contact details are set out below.<br>
<br>
You have the right to check what Personal Information CUDO holds about you<br>
<br>
Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to obtain access to any  personal information which CUDO holds about you and to advise CUDO of  any perceived inaccuracy. There are some limitations to this right set  out in the Act, which mean that we can refuse to provide you access to  that information in limited circumstances, including where granting you  access might have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other  individuals, if the request is frivolous or vexatious; and if the  information relates to anticipated legal proceedings.<br>
<br>
To make a request to access any personal information CUDO holds about  you, please contact CUDO in writing as set out below. CUDO will require  you to verify your identity and specify what personal information you  require. CUDO may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying your  application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material  requested. If the personal information sought is extensive, CUDO will  advise of the likely cost in advance and can help to refine your request  if required.<br>
