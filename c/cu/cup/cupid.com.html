<p>
('<b>We</b>') Cupid plc are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>

<p>
We are the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the '<b>Act</b>').
</p>

<p>
<b>What information do we collect about you?</b>
</p>

<p>We may collect and process the following information about you: </p>

<p>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site (the '<b>Site</b>') (including your personal details, contact details, mobile phone number and other profile information you submit when you create a membership profile). We may also collect information when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback and participate in competitions.
</p>

<p>
Information from your web-based email accounts (including your profile picture and other publicly visible information) if you agree to add the Site's email address to the contact lists stored at your email provider's website.
</p>

<p>
Your location according to the IP address assigned to your PC by your Internet Service Provider.
</p>

<p>
If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
</p>

<p>
Details of transactions you carry out through the Site, including any information we require to provide any products or services that you order from us through the Site.
</p>

<p>
Website usage information is also collected using cookies (see below under 'Cookies'). </p>

<p>
<b>How will we use the information about you?</b>
</p>

<p>We
use the information we hold about you in the following ways: </p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
To help us improve the structure, layout and usability of the Site.
</p>

<p>
To allow you to participate in any interactive features of the Site (including the features that require the mobile phone number).
</p>

<p>
To help personalise your repeat visits to the Site.
</p>

<p>
To notify you of any compatible matches or any matches who are near your location.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>What information do we collect about others?</b>
</p>

</p>

<p>

</a>
</p>

<p>
We will not store your Contacts information after invitations (up to a maximum of 3) have been sent.

</p>

<p>
<b>Where we store your personal data</b>
</p>

<p>
The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside the European Economic Area ('<b>EEA</b>'). It may also be
processed by staff located outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers (for example, staff who are involved in providing services that you order from us, processing your payment details or providing support services for the Site). By submitting your personal data to us through the Site, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance
with this privacy policy.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Athough we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

time by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:info@cupid.com">info@cupid.com</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>
<b> Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet: </b>&nbsp;We do not solicit or target persons younger than legal age for collection of information online.
