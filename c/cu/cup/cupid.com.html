				Terms of Use Agreement</a>.</p><br><h3>About Cupid.com</h3>
		Cupid.com, Inc. is the sole owner and operator of the Website Cupid.com and of 
		the information collected on the Website. Cupid.com endeavors to be an 
		all-encompassing Website designed to fulfill the needs of today's singles 
		community. Cupid.com enhances the single lifestyle by providing a web-based 
		portal for people to meet one another in the interests of friendship as well as 
		dating. To facilitate this, Cupid.com offers next generation personal ads, 
		focused social interest circles, dating advice and information as well as 
		dating-oriented products and services.
		<br><br><h3>What Information is Collected or Tracked</h3>
		Cupid.com is a membership-based service. To enjoy the services and products 
		offered by Cupid.com, a person voluntarily registers on the Website to become a 
		member and thereby submits certain personally identifiable information. 
		Visitors (non-members) may browse certain parts of the website at no cost and 
		without entering any personally identifiable information. The term "user" is 
		defined generally as any person, including members and visitors, who access the 
		website for any purpose. This Privacy Statement applies to all users of the 
		Website, unless otherwise expressly stated. Information gathered by Cupid.com 
		falls into two categories: directly submitted and indirectly (passively) 
		submitted.
		<br><br><h3>Directly Submitted Information</h3>
		Only Members are required to submit a range of personally identifiable 
		information about themselves as part of the registration process. The 
		information directly submitted to Cupid.com can be classified into two 
		categories: Public and Private.
		<br><br><h3>Public Information</h3>
		The goal of Cupid.com is to provide a forum for people to get together. To this 
		end, Cupid.com encourages the posting of certain personally identifiable 
		information to be placed in a general public viewing area of the website which 
		cannot be used to contact a particular user ("Public Information"). Most Public 
		Information is optional and its public posting is encouraged so that the user 
		has the best experience possible with Cupid.com's matching service. A user's 
		public information includes, but is not limited to, any of the following listed 
		separately or in combination: photo, gender, age, physical appearance, 
		relationship sought, marital status, race, religion, and educational level 
		Members also receive an Online Name that is used on both the public viewing and 
		member profile areas. We strongly encourage all members to not use their real 
		name or a variation of their name, but to select an Online Name that is unique 
		and different.
		<br><br><h3>Private Information</h3>
		For users to become members and to access various services and membership 
		levels, and for Cupid.com to provide its services, products and operational 
		support for the Website, we require the following personally identifiable 
		"Private Information": first and last name, home address, email address, birth 
		date, telephone number, and member password. To become a Gold Member <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/current_prices.aspx','prices','width=500,height=425')" class="sml_nodec"><img src="images/ribbon_gold_13x18.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle" alt="What Is A Gold Membership"><sup>(What's 
				This?)</sup></a> or to become a Platinum Member <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/membership_extras.aspx','prices','width=500,height=425')" class="sml_nodec"><img src="images/ribbon_platinum_13x18.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle" alt="What Is A Platinum Membership"><sup>(What's 
				This?)</sup></a>, we also require financial information for payments 
		(such as a billing address, name of credit card holder, credit card number and 
		expiration date). All Private Information can be updated by the member at any 
		time using the "My Account" tools. This Private Information is considered 
		confidential and, except as otherwise set forth herein-below, is not made 
		publicly available. If accurate and current Private Information is not 
		provided, we will be unable to process your membership.
		<br><br><h3>"Send This Profile"- Third Party Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
		If a user elects to use our "Send This Profile" service for informing a friend 
		about a potential match, we ask the user for the friend's email address, which 
		is defined as "third-party personally identifiable information." Cupid.com, 
		Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit 
		that public profile on the site. Cupid.com, Inc. does not store the email 
		address or use it for any other purpose.
		<br><br><h3>Indirectly Submitted Information</h3>
		Users may explore the Website and access certain portions without directly 
		providing any personally identifiable information. However, this Website 
		indirectly collects certain types of information from users when they visit 
		Cupid.com. Such passively submitted information collected from users is not 
		classified as personally identifiable information, nor is it linked to 
		personally identifiable information. Like most websites, we use log files. This 
		includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, 
		platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, 
		administer the site, and track users' movement.
		<br><br><h3>How Information is Used</h3>
		In addition to providing customer support and delivering the products and/or 
		services you have ordered, Cupid.com will use the Public Information and/or 
		Private Information you provide to cause information, offers, products, and/or 
		services that appear to us to be consistent with your expressed interests to be 
		directed to you. This is typically accomplished by sharing, selling, licensing, 
		and/or transferring your Public Information and/or Private Information with 
		third parties. We may, however, also use your Public Information and/or Private 
		Information to direct to you information, offers, products, and/or services 
		from us. Your Public Information and Private Information may, therefore, 
		ultimately be used for marketing purposes by us and/or any reputable third 
		party with whom we may work. In addition, we may provide aggregate statistics 
		about our members and visitors regarding demographic information, traffic 
		patterns, user movements and related website information to reputable third 
		parties, but these statistics do not disclose personally identifiable 
		information from or about a particular user.
		<br><br>
		We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web 
		site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, 
		email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web 
		sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest 
		to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your 
		choices about not having this information used by these companies, follow this 
		link:<br><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="ads">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.
		<br><br><h3>Public Information</h3>
		Public Information provided by a Member is used to create a profile that is 
		typically viewable to all other users of the Website for searching and 
		matchmaking purposes. The member has the option to hide his/her profile, making 
		it not publicly visible, using the "Privacy Settings" tools. Publicly posted 
		information cannot be used to contact a member by real name, home or billing 
		street address, phone number, email address, etc.<br><br>
		We strongly encourage all members to not use their real name or a variation of 
		their name, but to select an Online Name that is unique and different.

			CUPID.COM, INC. IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR USERS WHO INTENTIONALLY OR OTHERWISE 
			DISCLOSE PRIVATE INFORMATION IN THE FREE TEXT AREAS OF THEIR PROFILE, EMAIL 
			CORRESPONDENCE OR IN PUBLIC FORUMS WHICH ARE PUBLICLY VIEWABLE BY USERS SUCH

			LOOKING FOR,", "THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN MY LIFE IS", AND "HOW I SPEND MY 
			FREE TIME."
			<br><br></p><h3>Private Information</h3>
			Cupid.com will use a member's personally identifiable Private Information 
			primarily for three reasons: 1) customer service and operational issues; 2) 
			billing issues; and 3) to investigate violations of our Terms of Use Agreement 
			and to conduct any enforcement measures. Except as otherwise set forth above, 
			all Private Information submitted by the member is kept confidential and will 
			not be disclosed to third parties except as required by law; to protect the 
			visitors and members, employees, or property of Cupid.com; and in the event of 
			a merger or a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the business, 
			assets, or equity of Cupid.com, Inc. and /or its parent company to another 
			company or entity.
			<br><br><h3>Cupid.com/PreDating Events</h3>
			Users may opt to register for and participate in Cupid.com/PreDating 
			events. These events are typically produced, coordinated and sponsored by other 
			companies. In order to conduct the event, your first and last name will be 
			shared with such company responsible for producing, coordinating, and 
			sponsoring the event.
			<br><br><h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
			Members will occasionally receive information on current or new products, 
			services, or special deals from Cupid.com or its selected partners. Out of 
			respect for the privacy of our members, we provide the option to not receive 
			these types of communications at the initial point of registration. Members who 
			thereafter wish to change whether or not to receive promotional communications 
			may designate their choice using the "Privacy Settings" tools.
			<br><br><h3>Cookies</h3>
			A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information 
			about the user. The cookie contains no personally identifiable information. We 
			use a session ID cookie so that once the user closes the browser, the cookie 
			terminates. The cookie is used to verify your logged-in status. A Member must 
			be logged in to their account to use Cupid.com.<br><br>
			As a user, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is 
			being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. This is done through the 
			browser's (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser 
			is different, so look at your browser's "HELP" menu to learn the correct way to 
			modify your cookies setting. If you turn off your cookies, you may not have 
			access to many features at the website or other services may not function 
			properly. For example, members will not be able to log in to their accounts if 
			the cookies are turned off.
			<br><br><h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
			The ads appearing on this Website are currently delivered by Advertising.com, 
			Inc. Cupid.com, Inc. has given Advertising.com, Inc. permission to use cookies 
			on the Cupid.com website. Advertising.com, Inc.'s cookies do not collect or 
			link to personally identifiable information. Information about users' visits to 
			this website, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user 
			name, address, or other personally identifiable information), is used to serve 
			targeted ads to users. For more information about Advertising.com, Inc., 
			cookies, and how to "opt-out" of receiving follow-up or targeted information 
			from advertisers, please <a href="http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html" target="_blank">
				click here</a>. Cupid.com users may eliminate the advertiser's use of 
			cookies to target such advertising but cannot eliminate advertising generally 
			on the website.<br><br>
			This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Cupid.com only and does not 
			cover the use of cookies by any advertiser, including Advertising.com, Inc.
			<br><br><h3>Operational Service Providers and Third Party Intermediaries
			</h3>
			It may be necessary to share personal information with Cupid.com's operational 
			service providers, the specialists that provide internal support to our 
			operations including billing and fulfillment of membership services. For 
			example, Cupid.com uses an outside credit card processing company to bill for 
			services. We have been advised by our operational service providers that they 
			do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any 
			secondary purposes.
			<br><br><h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3><b>THOUGH WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PRESERVE USER PRIVACY, WE MAY NEED TO DISCLOSE 
				PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WHEN REQUIRED BY LAW OR TO COMPLY WITH 
				LEGAL PROCESSES; TO RESPOND TO CLAIMS THAT ANY OF THE CONTENT VIOLATES THE 
				PROPERTY, PRIVACY, PUBLICITY OR OTHER RIGHTS OF OTHERS; TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS,

				CORRESPONDENCE, OR IN OTHER PUBLIC FORUMS WHICH ARE PUBLICLY VIEWABLE BY USERS 
				SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF CUPID.COM: "ABOUT ME," "I'M 
				LOOKING FOR,"AND "HOW I SPEND MY FREE TIME."</b><br><br><h3>Links</h3>
			For the convenience of our users, this Website links to other sites. Please be 
			aware that Cupid.com, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy policies or 
			business practices of such other third-party websites. We encourage our users 
			to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of 
			each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This 
			Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by Cupid.com's 
			website.
			<br><br><h3>Security</h3>
			This website takes several precautions to protect members' information. When 
			members submit personally identifiable information via the website, their 
			information is protected both online and off-line. Our order form asks users to 
			enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers). Such information is 
			encrypted and is protected with the most widely used and trusted encryption 
			software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, 
			the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and 
			Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, 
			when users are just "surfing".
		<p></p><script src="https://siteseal.thawte.com/cgi/server/thawte_seal_generator.exe"></script><div align="center"><a href="javascript:OpenCertDetails()"><img src="images/thawte_stamp.gif" border="0" alt="Click here for more details"></a></div><p>We also take certain measures to protect personally identifiable information 
			off-line. All members' information, not just the sensitive information 
			mentioned above, is restricted from access in our offices. Only authorized 
			employees who require the information to perform a specific job (for example, a 
			billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to such 
			information. We also provide training to new employees that have access to our 
			confidential databases and members information. Our production servers that 
			store personally identifiable information are also in a secure environment, in 
			a fortified facility with biometric identification systems.<br><br>
			If you have any questions about the security at our Website, <a href="mailto:privacyissue@cupid.com">
				contact us</a>.
			<br><br></p><h3>Correcting/Updating or Removing Personal Information</h3>
			All personally identifiable Public Information can be accessed, corrected, and 
			updated via the "My Profile" section of the website at any time. Private 
			Information can be accessed, corrected, and updated via the "My Account" tools. 
			Most information may be removed via the same section, except for the required 
			Private Information needed to be a member such as: first and last name, home 
			address, email address, birth date, telephone number, member password and 
			financial information for payments for Gold Members <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/current_prices.aspx','prices','width=500,height=425')" class="sml_nodec"><img src="images/ribbon_gold_13x18.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle" alt="What Is A Gold Membership"><sup>(What's 
					This?)</sup></a>, such as a billing address, credit card number, 
			expiration date. A member can also change his/her "opt-in" choices using the 
			"Privacy Settings" tools.
			<br><br><h3>Notification of Changes and Opt-in/Opt-out Policy</h3>
			If changes to our Privacy Statement become necessary, Cupid.com will post those 
			changes to this Privacy Statement, so our users are always aware of what 
			information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we 
			disclose it to third parties. If we are going to use a Member's personally 
			identifiable information in a manner significantly different from that stated 
			at the time of collection we will notify members via email and our members will 
			have an affirmative choice ("Opt-in") as to whether or not we can use their 
			information in this manner. If our members do not provide such consent we will 
			continue to use their information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
			which the information was collected.
