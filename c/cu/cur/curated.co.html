      <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.</p>
      <p>We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at <a href="http://curated.co">Curated</a>.
      </p><h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>
      <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your email address, name, postal address ("Personal Information").<br>

      <p>In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Service's functionality. These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.</p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <h2>Compliance With Laws</h2>
      <p>We will disclose your Personal Information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.</p>
      <h2>Business Transaction</h2>
      <p>If Curated Software is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personal Information may be transferred as a business asset. In such cases, we will provide notice before your Personal Information is transferred and/or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
