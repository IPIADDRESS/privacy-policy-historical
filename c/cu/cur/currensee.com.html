    <p>
	<strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
	At Currensee our most important asset is our relationship with you. Therefore, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information we collect from you via this website (the “Site”).</p>
<p>
	Your information is yours and we respect that. This policy outlines the types of information Currensee collects about you and how that information is used. The policy applies to all current and former members of Currensee. This policy may be revised from time to time, so please revisit this page often to remain fully informed of our policies.</p>
<p>
	We take precautions to ensure the information we collect about you is protected and is accessed only by authorized individuals and organizations. Specifically, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>
	Because we know how important security and privacy is to you, Currensee operates under the following principles when handling your personal information:</p>
<p>
	We allow you to create a screen name that is not your real name, providing you control of identifying information within the Currensee community.</p>
<p>
	As a registered user, you may provide Currensee with the credentials to access your brokerage account (i.e. user ID, password, information necessary to access your account), we will never access your accounts for any other purpose than to provide the services as you have requested. Currensee uses security systems similar to those used by banks and other holders of sensitive information to protect credential information you entrust to us.</p>
<p>
	You can de-activate your account for any reason at any time and we will delete all of your personally identifiable information from our servers. We will not keep a copy of your personally identifiable information for any purposes upon account deactivation except as may be required by law or to otherwise protect legal rights.</p>
<p>
	We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Further, our employees and third party service providers have access to your nonpublic personal information only on a "need to know" basis. Finally, we internally audit our business practices and procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access in order to protect your personal information.</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Information We Collect</span></strong><br>
	<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>
	When you browse the non-password protected portions of our Site, you do so anonymously; no personally identifiable information is collected. When you sign up to become a registered user of Currensee we request that you provide to us your name, address and email address, as well as your trading behavior, such as the techniques you use and the instruments you trade.</p>
<p>
	You may also choose to supply trading information (e.g., how long you have been trading, your preferred trading hours, etc.) and a profile description. Once you register with Currensee and sign in to our Site, you are not anonymous to us. We may use the Registration Information to open an account with us, to provide services that may be useful to you and to contact you.</p>
<p>
	Our Site also permits you to contact us via email and our Contact Us form. Whenever you send an email via our Site or through the Contact Us form, you will be providing us with your name, email address and any information you choose to include in the text of your message. For example, you may choose to provide your mailing address or other information necessary or helpful for us to address your query or concern.</p>
<p>
	In addition, as a registered user of our Site, we collect and maintain information about your membership activity. This activity includes your trading ideas, executed transactions, positions, history, comments, subscriptions to other members as well as ratings of other members’ trading ideas and comments and their ratings of you. We publish this information and derivatives based on this information on our Site and we use this information to provide the services you have requested.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Additional Personal Information You Provide, or Direct Us to Collect from Others, to Use our Service</strong></p>
<p>
	We also collect personal information from you in two other general ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Personal information you directly provide or input as you use the Currensee Site; and</li>
<li>
		Personal information we gather with your permission from third party websites and Internet services that you register on our Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	For example, once you are a registered user of our Site, you may register your brokerage account through our Site by providing the user ID, password and other information necessary to access such account (“Verification Information”). We will collect the transactional information regarding your brokerage account to display it to you on the Site. This information may include your current holdings, and your past and future transactions, to name a few.</p>
<p>
	Currensee limits its use of your personal investment information to the purposes for which it has been collected and as we describe in this Privacy Policy. Except as necessary to carry out your requests, Currensee uses this information only on an aggregate, non-personal basis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Technical and Other Information</strong></p>
<p>

	<u><strong><a name="snfaq"></a>Social Networking FAQ</strong></u></p>
<p>
	<strong>Social Networking in General and the Currensee Trader Social Network</strong></p>
<p>
	Social networks are on-line groups, networks or communities of people who share some common element(s) such as a particular interest, and are interested in exploring and discussing such interests with others on the internet. Social networking involves the on-line interaction of its members via multiple and various electronic formats, such as chat, messaging, email, video, voice chat, file sharing, blogging, discussion groups and so on.</p>
<p>
	A social network provides its members with many features, such as the ability to create and view profiles of other members who share commonalities. A social network also allows members to create personal profiles, potentially with fairly detailed information, as well as allow its members to engage in activities such as create personal blogs, share personal information and other applications that allow its members to help them to connect with other network members.</p>
<p>
	The Currensee Trader Social Network is limited to individuals who are active forex traders, as described in the Terms of Use <a href="http://www.currensee.com/terms-of-use" title="http://www.currensee.com/terms-of-use">http://www.currensee.com/terms-of-use</a>. As with other social networks, members of the Currensee Trader Social Network may create personal profiles, in this case with respect to their forex trading, and may share among other information, information on their forex trading activities and performance and their market views and trading strategies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Benefits to Social Networks</strong></p>
<p>
	A social network provides opportunities for its members to engage with other members and share information over the Internet and find other members on-line with similar interests.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Risks to Social Networks</strong></p>
<p>
	Social networks are not without their risks, which are no different than any other on-line activity. With public spaces, or even within a closed social network community, the services can be used by anyone. There are risks as one does not truly know who the other members of the social network are. In addition, while Currensee does its best to restrict access to your information, Currensee has no control over what third parties with access to your information may do with it. For example, you may post certain personal information, but another member copies and publishes it.</p>
<p>
	When using social networks, you should take caution when posting your personal information as well as carefully consider the information you get from the social network. You should take care in trusting the information posted in a social network as it may be difficult to prevent members or the public at large from posting false or misleading information, including information in their personal profiles. Although Currensee takes reasonable steps to regularly monitor the content of its site to identify and remove any misleading or otherwise fraudulent posts, and may ban a member for egregious or repeat violations, there is no assurance that we will detect all misleading or fraudulent posts, and members should not rely upon or assume the accuracy of information posted by other members and should make their own independent trading decisions.</p>
<p>
	In addition, be careful with personal information. Once you have posted your personal information to the internet, you have lost control over who will see it and how it will be used. Information you post or as contained in your profile can easily be copied and shared with thousands of others at the press of a button. In addition, when posting other materials, such as photos, you should take precaution as such information or pictures can be altered or distorted.</p>
<p>
	There is the potential for risk in using the Currensee Trader Social Network stemming from the illegal or improper use of the social network by third parties who might, for example, post misleading information in an attempt to improperly influence trading decisions or find ways to copy and aggregate member profiles, collect personal financial information or copy personal content and use it for their own purposes.</p>
<p>
	Beware of files posted or clicking on executable files on social networks as social network sites provide an ideal and cost-efficient platform for the distribution of viruses, worms and bots, Trojans, spyware and more. Companies with a presence on these sites could be adversely affected.</p>
