<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the practices of Beacon Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a “Curiosity”) concerning information we obtain by and through your use of the Curiosity.com website (the “Site”) our Curiosity mobile application (the “Application”) and the services offered through either the Site or the Application (the “Services”). </p>

<p> Curiosity is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of Personally Identifiable Information you share with us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the types of information Curiosity obtains about visitors to our Site and users of our Application and Services, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information.   By using the Site, the Services and/or the Application, you are accepting and consenting to the use of your information as described in this policy. </p>

<h3>A. What Information We Collect </h3>

<p>The information we collect on our Site and through the use of our Services or Application generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  If we do combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

<h4>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

<p>“Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.  Curiosity collects and stores personally identifiable information that you provide to us.  The Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include: your name, date of birth, e-mail address, login name, passwords, etc. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you register on the Site or through the Application.</p>

<h4>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

<p>“Non-Personally Identifiable Information” refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  This can be can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests.  The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site may include: your Internet Protocol ("IP") address; “cookies” or small text files that collect information about our activity on our Site, including the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, which URL you go to next, which browser you used to come to our Site, and any search terms entered on our Site.  More information about Cookies appears below.</p>

<p>We may also collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the form of demographic information, such as your gender, age and interest.  We use this information to provide you with personalized services and information that we believe may be of interest to you.   We may also collect, analyze and use aggregated and anonymized information about you for market research.</p>

<p>Your use of the Application may also include collection of information from your mobile device.  For example, the Application may request your permission to collect location data and/or may request access to multimedia (photos or videos) stored on your mobile device.  If you do not wish for your location data to be shared with Curiosity, please respond accordingly when prompted on your mobile device, or visit your mobile device settings.  Multimedia will only be collected from your device if you affirmatively select it to upload to the Application (i.e. you choose an image or video to store within the Application).  </p>

<h3> Cookies </h3>
<p> Our Site uses or may use "cookies" to gather Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to store information about your preferences and activity during and after your visit to a web site.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, there may be some features of our Site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.  By using the Site and/or Application, you consent to Curiosity’s use of “cookies.”</p>

<h3>C. How We Collect Information </h3>

<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information only when you provide it to us.

There may be times, such as when a user registers through the Site and/or Application or signs up for any other product or service we may offer through the Site or the Application, when we will ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address, etc. Whether or not you choose to provide such information is completely your own choice, but if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to use certain services, offers, and content on our Site, or that may be available by using the Application.</p>

<p>Our Site and Application may automatically collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including the web page from which a visitor enters our Site, which pages a visitor visits on our Site, and how much time a visitor spends on each page.  Your mobile device may also collect certain information if permitted by you, including geolocation data.</p>

<h4>Generally speaking, we do not shared your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties, except as follows: </h4>

<ul>
    <li>With Service Providers and/or Affiliates: We may use other companies to perform services including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of our Site or Services such as processing transactions and/or sending emails.  These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your information solely for the purpose of providing these services to you on our behalf. </li>
    <li>Special Circumstances: We also may disclose your information, including Personally Identifiable Information, in the following circumstances: </li> 
    <ul>

        <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Site’s terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. </li>
        <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as the sale of all or a portion of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the event of bankruptcy.  We will endeavor to contact you in the event of any of these transactions, but we do not promise to do so.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3> Notice to California Residents </h3>
<p>California law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Generally speaking, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for that purpose.  However, if you would like to make a request to review information regarding such disclosures, if any exist, please contact us at info@curiosity.com.</p>

<h3>E. How We Protect Your Information </h3>
<p>We use reasonable technological and physical safeguards to protect Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  </p>
<p>

<p>If you do not want your Personally Identifiable Information collected or stored, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted personal information and would like us to correct or remove your information from our records, please contact info@curiosity.com.</p>

<h3>G. Links to Third Party Sites and/or Integration with Third Party Platforms</h3>
<p>Our Site and Application may interface with third party sites and services, (for example, social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or other third party applications, sites or services).  Our Site may also contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control.</p>
<p>Privacy policies for these third party sites and services may be different from our privacy policy. You access these third party sites and services at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site or integrated service before disclosing any personal information on such site and/or through such service. Curiosity is not responsible for and cannot control the use of any information you submit to third parties. </p>
<p>Currently, to help facilitate login to our Application and our Site, we offer a sign-on service that allows you to sign in using login credentials from your existing social media account.  This allows you to associate your existing social media profile with your Curiosity account.   By linking these accounts, Curiosity may access to certain profile information contained within your social media profile; this may include your full name, e-mail, locale, gender, profile picture, and friends list as well as other publicly available profile information.  Curiosity uses this information only to facilitate and enhance your use of the Site, the Services and/or Application and your sharing of Curiosity content with existing friends and contacts.    You can disassociate your social media account from your Curiosity account at any time by accessing your social media platform settings.</p>

If you don’t want people to know your username, for example,  or specific information about you, don’t post publicly or include such information in any comment you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.</p>

<p>We provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive certain types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products or information that we think may be of interest to you. The opt-out choice may be exercised by following instructions included within our email communications. We will process your unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. </p>

<h3> J. International Transfer of Information</h3>
