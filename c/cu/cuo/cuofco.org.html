<p>We thank you for entrusting us with your finances as well as some of your family’s most important information. We are committed to protecting your privacy at all times. We follow the privacy practices outlined within.<br>
<br>
<strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
We maintain strict security procedures and collect information about our members for lawful business purposes only, or as required by applicable law. We collect information from these sources: a) information you provide on applications and other forms, such as name, address, social security number, assets and income; b) information on your transactions with us, such as account balance, payment history, parties to our transactions and credit card usage; and c) information from consumer reporting agencies regarding your creditworthiness and credit history.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use and Sharing of Personal Information</strong><br>
We do not disclose non-public personal information about our members or former members, except as permitted by applicable law. Credit Union of Colorado contracts with a variety of third parties to bring you financial services. We disclose information about you as necessary to fulfill these third-party service agreements. For example, we may disclose information to third parties that assist us in printing checks or mailing statements. We may also disclose non-public personal information about you to governmental entities, such as sending annual income statements to the IRS, and to other third parties, such as credit bureaus, or in response to subpoenas.<br>
<br>
We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to third parties that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions, such as insurance providers, with whom we have joint marketing agreements, in order to make a variety of financial services available to you. In all such instances, we will provide information only to third parties who meet our security and privacy standards, and who agree in writing to strict confidentiality provisions to ensure the protection of your information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Web Site Information</strong><br>
Credit Union of Colorado collects standard non-identifying information about visits to its web site, such as date and time our site was accessed; domain name and IP address; web browser used; pages accessed; and city, state and country. Use of this information is restricted to compiling standard statistics that measure the use of the site. Visitors to Credit Union of Colorado’s web site remain anonymous until they choose to provide personal information to access personal account information that Credit Union of Colorado makes available online.<br>
<br>
<strong>Online Transactions/E-Mail</strong><br>
After you register for our online services, our data system records certain online information including transactions you conduct online. This data enables us to process and confirm your transactions. When you send us an e-mail, we will retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address and our response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also use it to measure how effectively we address your concerns.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
When you visit www.cuofco.org, you can surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our site, we use “cookies” to track your visit. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can be read only by the server that gave it to you. Our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer. We will not request, require or collect personal identifying information about you and you will remain anonymous. We collect non-identifying data about your use of our site so we can improve our site’s usefulness to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
We are committed to taking every reasonable precaution to protect individual identifying data you give us. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide service to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Accuracy of Personal Information</strong><br>
We put in place reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of our records and your personal information. We will correct any inaccurate information as quickly as possible when it is brought to our attention. If you have any questions about the accuracy of your personal information, please call a Credit Union representative, or contact us at www.cuofco.org. We will investigate your issue and update your records as needed. We request that you keep your personal information as current as possible so that you can get the maximum benefit from the Credit Union.<br>
<br>
<strong>Protection of Your Children’s Online Privacy</strong><br>
We do not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children online without express parental consent or notification. If we receive online information from anyone that we know to be a child, we will use the information only to respond directly to a child’s request. We recognize that protecting children’s identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.<br>
<br>
<strong>Links to Third-party Web Sites</strong><br>
For your convenience, our web site contains links to third-party web sites, such as sites where you can reorder checks. We provide these links as a service to you. When you click on a link to a third-party web site you leave our web site. You can tell you have left our web site because the address will no longer begin with http://www.cuofco.org, https://www.cuofco.org or https://hb.cuofco.org. We are not responsible for and have no control over the linked web site or its contents, or any links contained in a linked web site, nor do we vouch for the accuracy, privacy or security of the information on the destination server. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any linked web site, and their privacy and security policies may differ from ours. We are not affiliated with or an agent of any linked web site. We do not represent either the linked web site or the user if the two enter into a transaction.<br>
