We know how important it is to you, our member, that your personal information maintained by Credit Union ONE remains safe and 
secure.  Be assured, your credit union is committed to protecting your privacy, whether you conduct business with us by telephone,
U.S. Mail, in person at one of our branch retail outlets or electronically via the Internet, ATM network, Compu-Phone, or CU@Home

information remains just that, confidential.</p><p>

All Credit Union ONE employees are required to adhere to our Confidentiality/Nondisclosure Agreement, which includes maintaining

regarding your creditworthiness and credit history from credit reporting agencies in connection with making loan decisions, making,
servicing and collecting loans, and granting checking accounts and ATM/Debit card privileges.  Information obtained from our 
members is kept secure and access to that information is limited within the credit union to personnel who need to know the 
information to provide products or services to our members and properly operate the credit union.</p><p>
