<p><b>Collection of Non-PII (Non Personally Identifiable Information)</b><br>
I currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize my Internet Operations and communications. 
I use the services of marketing companies to help me measure the effectiveness of advertisments and promotions and how visitors use the site. 
To do this, I use Action Tags and cookies provided by the marketing companies on this site. 
The information I collect help me learn things like what kinds of visitors the site attracts, which of my provided resources most interest my Visitors, and what kinds of content my visitors like to see.

<p> 
Additional Tracking Services used are Google Analytics, MyWebLog, HitTail, CrazyEgg and some in-house developed tracking. I also plugin other Services from time to time for testing and research purposes. Looking for a Tracking and Web Analytics solution for yourself?
<a href="http://www.cumbrowski.com/CarstenC/Web-Analytics-Software.asp">Clicktracks</a> is a good and professional solution. Also check my <a href="http://www.cumbrowski.com/CarstenC/internetmarketing_webanalytics.asp">Web Analytics Resources</a>.
