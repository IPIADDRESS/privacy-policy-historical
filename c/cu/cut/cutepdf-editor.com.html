			<h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="p" align="justify">Acro Software, Inc. ("Acro
            Software"), the owner of CutePDF Editor, is dedicated to making your online experience as
            interesting and enjoyable as possible. Your privacy on the internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of CutePDF Editor, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. Acro Software reserves the right to change the Online Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion. Your use of the site will be subject to the most current version of the Online Privacy Policy at the time of such use.<br>
			<br>
            <b>Use of Personal Information</b><br>
            We do not require sign up or registration in order for you to access our web site and to fully use our services. Only when you submit a support request, you will be required to provide us with your contact information ("Personal Information"), which includes your name and email address. We may also ask you to provide additional information. The additional information will be voluntary. Acro Software collects your information in order to support your participation in the use of our service. In no way will your personal information ever be used without your consent.<br>
            <br>
            The only information we automatically collect is that related to the
            use of our web site. This information is anonymous and is gathered
            through our servers' log files. These log files record generic
            information, such as the number of visits our web site receives, the
            types of browsers used and the number of files downloaded, but never
            personal information. This log file information allows us to create
            better content aimed at our viewer's preferences.<br>
			<br>
            <b>Use of Documents</b><br>
            The CutePDF Editor web site acts as a passive conduit for the distribution and 
            receipt of the documents you submit for editing and therefore will not monitor, 
            edit, or disclose the contents of your documents unless required to do so by law 
            or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the 
            edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Acro Software; (2) protect 
            and defend the rights or property of Acro Software; or (3) protect the personal 
            safety of its members or the public. You should also be aware (and hereby agree) 
            that certain technical processing of and access to documents and their content by 
            Acro Software may be required to: (a) route the documents; (b) conform to connecting 
            networks' technical requirements; and (c) determine the cause of error messages 
            generated by problems in a document. The CutePDF Editor web site will only store your documents on its servers for your editing for a limited time and will delete them when you close the open documents. 
            The CutePDF Editor web site will endeavor to delete old files from its servers when the expiration period has run.<br>
            <br>
			<b>Security</b><br>
			We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of
			your transmissions (as well as your personally identifiable
			information), including firewalls and one-way hash encryption
			technology. These are the same technologies that most websites use to
			safeguard credit card information and other personal information. While
			we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our
			system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
			100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any
			information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We will
			continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes
			available. <br>
			<br>
            <b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
            Some of our pages use a feature of your browser called a
            "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, are not able to extract
            any personal information from you. This cookie automatically
            identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you
            visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, Acro Software will
            never know who you are, even though we may assign your computer a
            cookie. Also, CutePDF Editor web sites can only read cookies
            created by Acro Software's web sites. Cookies allow us to
            personalize our site for you and to provide you with information
            that fits your needs and desires. <br>
            <br>
			<b>Questions or Comments</b><br>
            Acro Software Inc. knows that your privacy is very important to you.
            We welcome questions and comments regarding this policy, so feel
            free to <a href="https://www.acrosoftware.com/info/contact.asp">contact us</a>. Because technologies
            on the Internet change so quickly, Acro Software reserves the right
            to modify its Privacy Statement from time to time. More legal
            information can be found in Acro Software's <a href="termsofuse.asp">Terms of Use</a>.<br>
