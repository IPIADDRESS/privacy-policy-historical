<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This site has a very simple privacy policy: we believe that your privacy is paramount.</p> 

<p>We do not collect any private information from our visitors except that which is being public by default. Namely, we maintain a list of <a href="ReciprocalMain.shtml">reciprocal links</a>, i.e. a list of sites with links to our pages. If you find your site on the list and wish it to be removed just send us a short email at <a href="mailto:noreciprocal@cut-the-knot.com">noreciprocal@cut-the-knot.com</a> with the URL of your site.</p>

<p>The only information that is collected when you visit this site is reflected in our counter which increases by 1 with every site access.</p>

<p>If you post a question to the <a href="exchange/index.shtml">CTK Exchange</a> we leave a "cookie" on your computer that identifies your question. This is only used in the process of posting the question to establish communication between two otherwise independent pages that are involved in posting.</p>

<p>The only time you become identifiable is when you send us email. We may use your email address to communicate with you but will not give or sell your email address to any other party.</p>

<p>Interactive Mathematics Miscellany works with a reputed third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how DoubleClick.com manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please read their <a href="http://www.sonar.com/content/privacy.htm">Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
