                We do not sell, and generally do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your
                consent. Parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child
                without also consenting to its disclosure to third parties as we do not share information that may be
                collected from your child. We use Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to
                monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the ZeptoLab Services, fulfill
                requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, and
                conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of Our business. Examples
                of how We share and discloses your information is as follows:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>(a) Legal.</strong> We may disclose information
                    you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders and other legal process, and to establish/exercise Our
                    legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when we believe that
                    disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
                    fraud, or respond to a government request. We may share Personal Information in order to investigate,
                    prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential
                    threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Our Terms of Use located at

                    <strong>(b) Business Transfers.</strong> As we continue
                    to develop Our business, we may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or
                    business units, or enter into joint ventures with third parties. In any of these types of transactions,
                    any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing
                    Privacy Notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of Our assets
                    are acquired or we merge with a third party, your information will likely be one of the transferred
                    assets. You understand and agree that we reserve the right to transfer any information collected from
                    you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before
                    Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

                    <strong>(c) Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control.</strong> We may use third-party companies and

                    hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists,
                    analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                    listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We will provide such
                    entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to
                    ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. We share information only as described above and with
                    third parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as
                    protective as this Privacy Policy.
