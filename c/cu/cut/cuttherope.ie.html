                ZeptoLab does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties
                without your consent. Parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information
                from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as ZeptoLab does not share
                information that may be collected from your child. ZeptoLab uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial
                Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems,
                improve the ZeptoLab Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about
                promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and
                protection of information is an important component of ZeptoLab's business. Examples of how ZeptoLab
                shares and discloses your information is as follows:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Legal</b>. ZeptoLab may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders,
                    requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise ZeptoLab's legal
                    rights. ZeptoLab may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when ZeptoLab
                    believes that disclosure is necessary to protect ZeptoLab's rights, protect your safety or the
                    safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. ZeptoLab may share Personal
                    Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
                    fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
                    of ZeptoLab's
                    <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, or as otherwise required by law.

                <li>
                    <b>Business Transfers</b>. As ZeptoLab continues to develop its business, ZeptoLab may reorganize as
                    a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures
                    with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of
                    the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent
                    otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of ZeptoLab's assets are acquired or
                    ZeptoLab merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets.
                    You understand and agree that ZeptoLab reserves the right to transfer any information collected from
                    you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, ZeptoLab will use reasonable efforts to notify
                    you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
                    policy.

                <li>
                    <b>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</b>. ZeptoLab may use third-party companies and
                    individuals to perform functions on ZeptoLab's behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders,
                    processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive
                    information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search
                    results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and
                    providing customer service. ZeptoLab will provide such entities with access to certain information
                    needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for
                    other purposes. ZeptoLab shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are
                    either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this
                    Privacy Policy.

                The security of your Personal Information is important to ZeptoLab. ZeptoLab follows generally accepted
                industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to ZeptoLab, both during transmission
                and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
                is 100% secure, however. Therefore, ZeptoLab cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security
                system is completely secure, ZeptoLab and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security
                measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by ZeptoLab.
                For ZeptoLab, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information
                is disclosed only on a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all Personal Information
                collected by ZeptoLab is done so via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using secure
                socket layer technology, "SSL") by industrial grade security software to guard against
                unauthorized access.
