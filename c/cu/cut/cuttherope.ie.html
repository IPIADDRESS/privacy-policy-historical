    <dd class="desc">
      <div>
        ZeptoLab does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties
        without your consent. Parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information
        from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as ZeptoLab does not share
        information that may be collected from your child. ZeptoLab uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial
        Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems,
        improve the ZeptoLab Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about
        promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and
        protection of information is an important component of ZeptoLab's business. Examples of how ZeptoLab
        shares and discloses your information is as follows:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Legal</b>. ZeptoLab may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders,
          requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise ZeptoLab's legal
          rights. ZeptoLab may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when ZeptoLab
          believes that disclosure is necessary to protect ZeptoLab's rights, protect your safety or the
          safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. ZeptoLab may share Personal
          Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
          fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
          of ZeptoLab's
          <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, or as otherwise required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Business Transfers</b>. As ZeptoLab continues to develop its business, ZeptoLab may reorganize as
          a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures
          with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of
          the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent
          otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of ZeptoLab's assets are acquired or
          ZeptoLab merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets.
          You understand and agree that ZeptoLab reserves the right to transfer any information collected from
          you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, ZeptoLab will use reasonable efforts to notify
          you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy
          policy.

        The security of your Personal Information is important to ZeptoLab. ZeptoLab follows generally
        accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to ZeptoLab, both during
        transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
        is 100% secure, however. Therefore, ZeptoLab cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        While no security system is completely secure, ZeptoLab and its third-party partners and vendors take
        appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by ZeptoLab.
        For ZeptoLab, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed
        only on a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by ZeptoLab is done so via secured connections
        and protected and encrypted (using secure socket layer technology,"SSL") by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.
