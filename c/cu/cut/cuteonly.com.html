      <strong class="cap1">CuteOnly Privacy Policy</strong>
      <p>We are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. We want to protect your personal information all the time and inform you about how we handle it. Our privacy policy is about as simple as it possible to be: </p>
      <p><strong class="cap2">1. Information We Gather Automatically</strong></p>
      <p>We use your IP address and cookies. IP is the series of numbers associated with the network you come from. This information does not disclose your personal details. We need it to maintain our Web site and collect geographical statistics of our visitors. Cookies are small text files that web sites place on your hard drive to identify you when you come back. We use cookies to deliver a content specific to your interests and to measure the effectiveness of CuteOnly advertisements on other Web sites. The use of cookies is a very common practice on the Internet but you can disable all cookies through your browser settings.
      </p>
      <p><strong class="cap2">2. Information We Ask You For </strong></p>
      <p>Any identifying information you give us that is not visible to other visitors, such as your email or surname, will be kept strictly private. We never share this information with other companies without your permission. Whenever we ask you for information, we make it absolutely clear whether it is visible to other users or not. </p>
      <p><strong class="cap2">3. Your Correspondence </strong></p>
      <p>All your interaction with other CuteOnly users as well as with CuteOnly team is strictly private and will never be used in any aims such as research or advertising without your permission. </p>
      <p><strong class="cap2">4. Non-Identifying Information </strong></p>
      <p>
	  Non-identifying information (not including any private information like surname, email or phone number!) is using to help other CuteOnly users find your personal profile. We may also use this information for research to improve the service quality. </p>
      <p><strong class="cap2">5. Financial Security </strong></p>
      <p>Financial information (such as credit card number) is processing by 2Checkout.com, one of the largest and most creditable credit card processing companies on the Web. Card numbers are transmitted directly to the banking network for authorization. 2Checkout.com does not record your card number anywhere and CuteOnly stuff has no access to this data. You enter sensitive information on <a href="http://www.2Checkout.com/">2Checkout.com</a> web server, and this information encrypts with secure socket layer technology (SSL). The SSL connection during the payment process ensure you with complete security. </p>
      <p>If you have farther questions or concerns about our privacy policy please us at <a href="mailto:legal@cuteonly.com.">legal@cuteonly.com</a>.</p>
