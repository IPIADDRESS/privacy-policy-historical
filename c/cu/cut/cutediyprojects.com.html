<p><b>7. Your rights</b></p>
<p>7.1 In this Section 7, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</p>
<p>7.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:</p>
<p>(a) the right to access;</p>
<p>(b) the right to rectification;</p>
<p>(c) the right to erasure;</p>
<p>(d) the right to restrict processing;</p>
<p>(e) the right to object to processing;</p>
<p>(f) the right to data portability;</p>
<p>(g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</p>
<p>(h) the right to withdraw consent.</p>
<p>7.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.[ You can access [your personal data] by visiting <i>[URL]</i> when logged into our website.]</p>
<p>7.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</p>
<p>7.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: [the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed]. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: [for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims].</p>
<p>7.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p>7.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>7.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p>
<p>7.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>
<p>7.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:</p>
<p>(a) consent; or</p>
<p>(b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,</p>
<p>and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p>7.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>7.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
<p>7.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data [by written notice to us] OR [by <i>[methods]</i>][, in addition to the other methods specified in this Section 7].</p>

<p><b>Privacy policy: drafting notes</b></p>
<p>This privacy policy is a shorter and simpler version of our privacy and cookies policy document, and may be used in relation to a wide variety of different kinds of website.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of a privacy policy is to assist a website operator to comply with information disclosure obligations under data protection legislation. From 25 May 2018 in the UK and elsewhere in the EU, that includes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Failure to comply may lead to civil liability and/or criminal law penalties.</p>
<p>This policy has been updated to take full account of the GDPR.</p>
<p>You should consider whether you need to take specialist legal advice on data protection. If you collect sensitive personal information (such as information about a person’s health, sexuality or political affiliations), or if you collect personal information from children or about children, you should always take advice before using this – or indeed any other – privacy policy template. In any case, use of a privacy policy is only one aspect of data protection compliance.</p>
<p>This document also includes optional provisions dealing with cookie-related disclosures.</p>
<p><b>Section 1: Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>Section 1.2</b></p>
<p>“Personal data” is defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR:</p>
<p>“(1) ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.</p>
<p>The inclusion of this statement in your privacy policy will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as regards consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is included on the Information Commissioner’s website (http://www.ico.gov.uk).</p>
<p><b>Section 2: How we use your personal data</b></p>
<p>Article 13(1) of the GDPR provides that:</p>
<p>“(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information: … (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party”.</p>
<p>Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR provides that:</p>
<p>“(1) Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: … (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.”</p>
<p><b>Section 2.1</b></p>
<p>Article 14 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information is not obtained from the data subject, provides that information about “the categories of personal data concerned” must be supplied to data subjects.</p>
<p>Article 13 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information is obtained from the data subject, does not include an equivalent provision.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have included references to general categories of data in this document, because this facilitates the identification of particular purposes of processing and the legal bases of processing – information which does need to be provided under Article 13.</p>
<p><b>Section 3: Providing your personal data to others</b></p>
<p>Article 13(1)(e) of the GDPR requires that where personal data are collected from the data subject, the data controller must provide the data subject with information about “the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data”.</p>
<p>Equivalent rules for data collected from someone other than the data subject are in Article 14(1)(e).</p>

<p><b>Section 4: International transfers of your personal data</b></p>
<p>Article 13(1)(f) of the GDPR requires that data controllers disclose to data subjects “where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 [transfers subject to appropriate safeguards] or 47 [binding corporate rules], or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1) [limited transfers for compelling legitimate interests], reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available”.</p>
<p><b>Section 5: Retaining and deleting personal data</b></p>
<p>Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR sets out the storage limitation, one of the fundamental rules of the regime:</p>
<p>“Personal data shall be: … kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject … “.</p>
<p><b>Section 7: Your rights</b></p>
<p>Article 13(2) of the GDPR provides that, where personal data is collected from a data subject, certain information about data subject rights must be provided:</p>
<p>“In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: … (b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability; (c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; …”.</p>
<p>Similar provisions are set out in Article 14 in relation to personal data which is not collected from the relevant data subject.</p>
<p><b>Section 7.3</b></p>
<p>The right to access is set out in Article 15 of the GDPR.</p>
<p><b>Section 7.4</b></p>
<p>The right to rectification is set out in Article 16 of the GDPR.</p>
<p><b>Section 7.5</b></p>
<p>The right to erasure (or right to be forgotten) is set out in Article 17 of the GDPR, and must be notified to data subjects under Articles 13(2)(b), 14(2)(c) and 15(1)(e) of the GDPR.</p>
<p>Consider modifying the highlighted circumstances and exclusions, depending upon what will be most relevant to your processing.</p>
<p><b>Section 7.6</b></p>
<p>Article 18(1) of the GDPR states:</p>
<p>“The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: (a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data; (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead; (c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; (d) the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</p>
<p><b>Section 7.7</b></p>
<p>The right to object to processing is detailed in Article 21 of the GDPR, and must be notified to data subjects under Articles 21(4), 13(2)(b) and 14(2)(c).</p>
<p><b>Section 7.8</b></p>
<p>Article 21(3) of the GDPR states:</p>
<p>“Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.”</p>
<p>This right is set out in Article 21(6) of the GDPR.</p>
<p><b>Section 7.10</b></p>
<p>The right to data portability is set out in full in Article 20 of the GDPR, and must be notified to data subjects under Articles 13(2)(b) and 14(2)(c).</p>
<p><b>Section 7.11</b></p>
<p>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority is set out in Article 77 of the GDPR, and must be notified to data subjects under Articles 13(2)(d), 14(2)(e) and 15(1)(f).</p>
<p><b>Section 7.12</b></p>
<p>Article 7(3) of the GDPR sets out the right of withdrawal. The right must be notified to data subjects under Articles 13(2)(c) and 14(2)(d). See also Article 17(1)(b).</p>
