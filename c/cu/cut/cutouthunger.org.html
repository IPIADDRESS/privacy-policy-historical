<table width="658" border="0">

<td width="652" height="1995" valign="top"><p class="text"><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong><br>
Cut Out Hunger, Inc. is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide 
this notice to explain the type of information we collect on the <strong>www.cutouthunger.org</strong> 
website and how we use this information. This Policy also explains the choices 
that you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Our Privacy 
Policy is available for you to review on our homepage and at every site where 
we have requested personally identifiable information. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>The Information We Collect:</strong><br>
You may be asked to provide personal information so that you can register to receive 
coupons, participate in a sweepstakes or contest, receive information, fill out 
a survey, or join a club. Your participation is voluntary and we will not require 
you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our 
current or future website's activities. In some instances, we may ask you questions 
on an aggregate basis (we don't identify you personally with the information) 
and such questions will be identified on the website. In all other instances, 
you should assume that we will track any information you provide on a personally 
identifiable basis. The types of personal information collected on this website 
includes: i) name; ii) address; iii) e-mail address; iv) demographic data; v) 
preferential data and other information that will help us better serve your consumer 
patterns. </p>
<p class="text">Cut Out Hunger, Inc. does not knowingly collect PII from children 
under the age of 13. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>The Way We Use Information</strong> </p>
<p class="text">Cutouthunger.org provides you with the opportunity to register 
on the site through the Registration section. Registration is required to be eligible 
to receive savings offers, enter any of the online contests or sweepstakes. Cutouthunger.org 
may use the information you provide when registering to fulfill prizes. </p>
<p class="text">When you register with our website, you can elect to receive information 
and updates on our products and services. Information will not be used for this 
purpose unless you request to receive Cutouthunger.org communications or communications 
from our business partners. </p>
<p class="text">We use information that you provide (individual and aggregate) 
to better design our website and to improve our marketing strategy and our products. 
One method through which this website collects aggregate information is the collection 
of IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve 
up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When 
you request a page from this website, our servers log your IP address. We do not 
link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session 
will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. To the extent such information 
is shared with third parties, please see "Our Privacy Practices With Third 
Parties" below. </p>
<p class="text">Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to forward pages or 
information on the site to friends. The information you provide to facilitate 
this email communication is used on a one-time basis and is not collected or retained 
by Cutouthunger.org. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>Unsubscribe/Delete</strong><br>
Cutouthunger.org gives users the following options for managing or removing their 
information from our database: </p>
<p class="text">1. Send us an email: Send an email to <a href="mailto:info@cutouthunger.org">info@cutouthunger.org</a>. 
Be sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us 
to do. </p>
<p class="text">2. Manage Your Cutouthunger.org Profile: Within the Registration 
section of Cutouthunger.org you have the option to Manage Your Cutouthunger.org 
Profile. The Cutouthunger.org management system allows you to update or delete 
your information from our database. We also allow you to subscribe or unsubscribe 
to any of the promotional email updates we send out. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored in your computer's 
hard drive when you visit a website. We use cookies to better tailor our site 
and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help 
speed up your future activities or to improve your user experience by remembering 
the information that you have already provided to us. We do not use cookies to 
retrieve information from your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you 
(i.e., during membership registration or a contest). The use of cookies is an 
industry standard and you will find them at most websites. Most browsers are initially 
set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to refuse 
cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent so that you can flush them 
from your browser if you object to their presence. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>Our Privacy Practices with Third Parties</strong><br>
We share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with 
advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. We do not provide 
any identifiable personal information to any third party for any purpose whatsoever 
unless you register or subscribe for their services. </p>
<p class="text">Our intention is never to use or share personally identifiable 
information provided to us in ways that are different than the ways described 
above without also providing you with an opportunity to "unsubscribe" 
or prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
Users should be aware that when you are on this website you could be directed 
to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites 
that take you outside our service. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, 
and partners that may use the Tropicana, or Cutouthunger.org logo. These other 
sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit 
personal information. Always be aware of where you end up. Check the linked site 
to locate its Privacy Policy, which may be different from our own. If the Cutouthunger.org 
website links you to any third party website, Cutouthunger.org makes no representation 
as to the existence, sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of their Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p class="text"><strong>Our Commitment to Data Security:</strong><br>
We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have 
put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard 
the information we collect. We cannot guarantee the security of any information 
you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>Changes in Our Policy</strong><br>
We reserve the right to change or remove this Privacy Policy at our discretion. 
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes here. We 
encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. If there is any 
material change in the type of information we collect, we will obtain your permission 
before we attempt to collect the additional personal information from your child. 
We will not make any changes, which allow us to give personal information to a 
third party without obtaining permission from you first. </p>
