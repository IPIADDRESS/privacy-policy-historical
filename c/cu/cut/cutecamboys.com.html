 	<p>12. <strong>Your European Union Privacy Rights</strong></p>
 	
	<p>If you are located in the European Union, under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Your rights may include the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data the Company holds about you and to check that the Company is lawfully processing it.</li>
		<li><strong>Request correction</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data the Company holds about you corrected, though the Company may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to it.</li>
		<li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask the Company to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for the Company to retain or process it. You also have the right to ask the Company to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where the Company may have processed your information unlawfully, or where the Company is required to erase your personal data to comply with applicable law. Note, however, that the Company may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
		<li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where the Company is relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where the Company is processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, the Company may demonstrate that it has compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that overrides your rights and freedoms.</li>
		<li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> your personal data. This enables you to ask the Company to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want the Company to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where the Company's use of the data is unlawful but you do not want the Company to erase it; (c) where you need the Company to hold the data even if the Company no longer requires it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to the Company's use of your data but the Company needs to verify whether the Company has overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
		<li><strong>Request transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. The Company will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for the Company to use or where it used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
		<li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> at any time where the Company is relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, the Company may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. The Company will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact the Company at <a href="mailto:legal@vsmedia.com" target="_top">legal@vsmedia.com</a></p>
	
	<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, the Company may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, the Company may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
	
	<p>The Company may need to request specific information from you to help it confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. The Company may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up its response.</p>
	
	<p>The Company tries to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take the Company longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, the Company will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
	
	<p>13. <strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></p>
	
	<p>The Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those other websites.
