<h4> Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>
<p>Cultural
Care Au Pair is committed to protecting the privacy of our online
users. We would like to share our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and
used. To make this notice easy to find, it is available in the
navigation bar at the bottom of every page and at every point where
personally identifiable information may be requested. This notice
applies to all information collected or submitted on the
culturalcare.com website.</p> <br>
<h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
<p>On
our site, you can request information, refer host families, download
the host family application, and access your online account.
Culturalcare.com maintains the confidentiality, security, and integrity
of personal information that we obtain from our users. We limit the
personally identifiable information we collect to only that which is
required to participate with Cultural Care.</p> <br>

<h4>Collection of Non Personal Information</h4><p>We
collect site traffic data from cookie usage on our site. We also use
information about IP addresses, types of Web browsers, Internet Service
Providers (ISPs), referring and exit pages, operating systems,
date/time stamps, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer
the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use. IP addresses and the like are not linked
to personally identifiable information. We also keep track of search
terms, so we know what visitors to our site are looking for. We do this
so that we may better develop the site to meet the needs of our users. </p> <br>

<h4>The Way We Use Information</h4><p>We
use the information you provide about yourself when requesting
information, only to complete that request. We do not share this
information with outside parties. Personal information collected by
Culturalcare.com is stored in secure operating environments that are
not available to the public. However, should you provide personally
identifiable information through email exchanges. We will protect your
privacy to the best of our ability by monitoring the sessions, but
always keep in mind that when you are in a public forum, you control
the information you disclose. You should always be careful when
distributing your personal information in this manner. We use the
information you provide about someone else only to confirm message
delivery for the 'refer a family' function. We do not share this
information with outside parties. Information you provide to us to
create a message is only used for that purpose, and it is only
disclosed to the recipient. We use return email addresses to answer the
email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and
are not shared with outside parties. Culturalcare.com may provide
aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and
related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these
statistics will include no personally identifying information. Finally,
we never use or share the personally identifying information provided
to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also
providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such
unrelated uses. </p> <br>

<h4>Reviewing or Changing Your Information</h4><p>You
can access personal information online by providing your host family
number and password when prompted at the login. We use this procedure
to better safeguard your information. You can request changes of
factual errors in your personal account via email to your Regional
Manager, by calling our toll-free number at (800) 333-6056, or by
sending mail to: <br><br>

Cultural Care Au Pair<br>
One Education Street<br>
Cambridge, MA 02141<br><br>
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
corrections. </p><br>
 
<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this
information by Culturalcare.com. If we decide to change our privacy
policy, we will post any changes on this page so that you are always
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances we disclose it. If we are going to use your personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice
as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner
different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify
users by way of email. If, however, you have opted out of communication
with the site then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal
information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any
material changes to our privacy practices that do not affect user
information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent
notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some cases
where we post the notice we will also email users who have opted to
receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our
privacy practices. </p><br>
