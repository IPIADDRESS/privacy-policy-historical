	                <h1 id="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</h1>

	                <p class="introduction">Your privacy is very important to Cultured Code. This Privacy Policy covers how
	                we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a
	                moment to get to know our practices and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

	                <h2 id="collection_and_use_of_personal_information">Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>

	                <p>Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a
	                specific individual.</p>

	                <p>Here are some examples of personal information that we collect:</p>

	                <ul class="style-loose">
	                <li>When you create a Things Cloud Account, we ask you for your email address.</li>
	                <li>When using Things Cloud to update your to-dos, we store the content of your to-dos, and we keep logs of the time and
	                device you used to access the service.</li>
	                <li>When you subscribe to any of our newsletters or forums, we also ask for your
	                email address; in some cases we may ask for additional information.</li>
	                <li>You may optionally provide personal information like your name when using
	                certain parts of our website (e.g. when participating in our forums); in this
	                case we permanently store and display this information to other visitors of the
	                website.</li>
	                <li>When you contact Cultured Code, e.g. for a support request, we may keep a
	                record of your communication.</li>
	                </ul>

	                <p>We use the personal information we collect to help us develop, deliver, protect,
	                and improve our products, services, content, and customer communications. We
	                also use it to keep you up to date on our latest product announcements and
	                updates, and to send you important notices, e.g. about changes to our Terms of
	                Service or our Privacy Policy. You may opt out of receiving some of these
	                communications.</p>

	                <p>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing,
	                data analysis, and research to improve our products and services.</p>

	                <h2 id="collection_and_use_of_non_personal_information">Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>

	                <p>Non-personal information is data that cannot be used to uniquely identify a
	                specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal
	                information for any purpose. We may combine personal and non-personal
	                information for certain purposes; this data will then be treated as personal
	                information for as long as it remains combined. Conversely, aggregated
	                information, i.e. data that might have originated from personal information, but
	                that has been processed in such a way as to not allow personal identification,
	                is treated as non-personal information.</p>

	                <p>Here are some examples of non-personal information that we collect – either by
	                ourselves or through the use of third-party services:</p>

	                <ul class="style-loose">
	                <li>When you visit our website, we keep logs of your Internet Protocol (IP)
	                address, browser type and language, referring and exit pages, operating system
	                and date/time stamp. Currently, we also use Google Analytics to collect and
	                process this information; please refer to the section “Google Analytics” below.
	                If you’d like to opt out of this logging, please click <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</li>
	                <li>When our Software crashes, we collect and store crash reports to help us
	                analyze the crash and determine the source of the problem. We currently use
	                HockeyApp to collect and process crash reports; please read their Privacy Policy
	                <a href="http://www.hockeyapp.net/privacy">here</a>.</li>
	                <li>Our Software periodically checks our servers for important updates or notices;
	                in this case, we also log the IP address, device type, language, operating
	                system and the date and time of the request.</li>
	                </ul>

	                <h2 id="google_analytics">Google Analytics</h2>

	                <p>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google,
	                Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on
	                your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The
	                information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
	                your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the
	                United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating
	                your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website
	                operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet
	                usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required
	                to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s
	                behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by
	                Google. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you
	                by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>

	                <h2 id="cookies_and_other_technologies">Cookies and other Technologies</h2>

	                <p>Cultured Code uses “cookies” to collect information about your use of the
	                website. Cookies are small text files a website can store on your hard drive. We
	                use the information we collect in this manner to better understand our users’
	                interaction with our website and to optimize the user experience. You can
	                disable cookies in your browser settings, but please note that certain features
	                on our website may not be available as a result.</p>

	                <p>In our email communications, we may use other technologies like “pixel tags” and
	                “click-through URLs” in order to determine if an email has been opened and which
	                links have been clicked. This way, we can determine and improve the
	                effectiveness of our communications. Pixel tags are small images shown inside an
	                HTML email; you can disable tracking by disabling HTML in your email client. A
	                link with a click-through URL, when clicked, first sends the user to a web
	                server which records the click, and then to the link’s destination.</p>

	                <h2 id="access_to_personal_information">Access to Personal Information</h2>

	                <p>When using our services or website, we aim to provide you with the means to
	                view, edit, and remove your personal information. For example, you can request
	                the deletion of your Things Cloud account and its associated email address by
	                going into the settings in any of our applications. For other personal
	                information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your data
	                so that you can request its correction or deletion. We will promptly process
	                these requests, unless we are required to retain information by law or for
	                legitimate business purposes. We may also decline requests if they would be
	                extremely impractical, are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate
	                technical effort, risk the privacy of others, or for which access is not
	                required by law.</p>

	                <p>Your personal information is retained for as long as it is necessary in order to
	                provide you our services, to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
	                Policy, to enforce applicable Terms of Service, or to comply with our legal
	                obligations. After we delete or block access to information from our services or
	                website, it will no longer be accessible to anyone; there may, however, continue
	                to be residual copies of that data on our active servers and backup systems.</p>

	                <h2 id="disclosure_to_3rd_parties">Disclosure to 3rd parties</h2>

	                <p>We don’t share personal information with anyone outside of Cultured Code, except
	                for the few exceptions below.</p>

	                <p>We work together with other companies who provide services to us, like hosting
	                our website, providing our help desk software, sending out newsletters,
	                analyzing our website traffic, hosting our cloud services, etc.. We only share
	                personal information with these companies if it is necessary for them to provide
	                their services. All companies we work with provide at least industry standard systems
	                and processes to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information.</p>

	                <p>We also share personal information if disclosure of such information is
	                reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
	                enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service,
	                including investigation of potential violations thereof; to detect, prevent, or
	                otherwise address fraud or security issues; and to protect against harm to the
	                rights, property or safety of Cultured Code, its users or the public as required
	                or permitted by law.</p>

	                <p>If Cultured Code is involved in a reorganization, merger, or sale, the
	                information we collect may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

	                <h2 id="protection_of_personal_information">Protection of Personal Information</h2>

	                <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to
	                or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include
	                internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and
	                security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security
	                measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal
	                data.</p>

	                <p>Whenever you connect to our Things Cloud service, we use Secure Sockets Layer
	                (SSL) encryption for all information that is being transmitted. However, no
	                method of transmitting or storing data is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee
	                the security of information you transmit to us.</p>

	                <p>Inside Cultured Code, we restrict access to personal information to only those
	                employees who need to know that information in order to deploy and maintain our
	                services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements and may be
	                subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
	                fail to meet these obligations.</p>

	                <p>Some parts of our website, such as our blog or forums, may allow you to post
	                personal information, such as your name or email address. This information is
	                publicly accessible and can be read, collected, and processed by anyone. So
	                please take care when using these features.</p>

	                <p>Please note that some of our servers may be located outside of the European
	                Union, as well as the servers of our partners (e.g. Google and HockeyApp). If
	                you use our services or website, you agree that your information is transmitted,
	                stored, and processed in data centers outside the EU.</p>

	                <h2 id="children">Children</h2>

	                <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we
	                learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will
	                promptly delete this information. Parents or guardians can contact us at
	                <a href="mailto:privacy@culturedcode.com?subject=Privacy Policy Inquiry">privacy@culturedcode.com</a>.</p>

	                <h2 id="3rd_party_sites_and_services">3rd Party Sites and Services</h2>

	                <p>Cultured Code’s website or any of our services may contain links to third-party
	                websites or services. We are not responsible for the information collected by
	                those third parties and we encourage you to read their privacy policy before
	                submitting any personal information to them.</p>

	                <h2 id="about_this_privacy_policy">About this Privacy Policy</h2>

	                <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. When we change the policy, we
	                will post the changes on this page, and, if the policy changes in a significant
	                way, we will also provide a prominent notice (e.g. on our website).</p>

	                <p>If you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at
	                <a href="mailto:privacy@culturedcode.com?subject=Privacy Policy Inquiry">privacy@culturedcode.com</a>.</p>
