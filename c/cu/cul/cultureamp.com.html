            <em>Security of your information</em>
          </p>
          <p>The security of your information is important to us. All of your data is private and confidential and we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.</p>
          <p>However, please note that transmitting information over the Internet is never completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your information is absolutely secure in all situations.</p>
          <p>Security is a collaborative effort, so we also recommend that you create a sophisticated password for logging in to our services, and keep that password secret.</p>
          <p>If you suspect there has been any unauthorized access or misuse of your personal information, please contact our <href="#contacting-our-privacy-officer">Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@cultureamp.com">privacy@cultureamp.com</a> immediately.</href="#contacting-our-privacy-officer"></p>

            <em>Where your information is located</em>
          </p>
          <p>Our servers are based in the United States, so your personal information will be processed and hosted in the United States. However, as some of our offices and service providers are located outside of the United States, there may be times when your personal information may be transferred, disclosed or processed in another country. For example, if you contact our Customer Success team for support or questions, your personal information may also be processed and hosted in Ireland.</p>
          <p>We will not transfer your personal information to a country or organization that does not implement privacy obligations that are at least comparable to those set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p>
            <em>How we use your information</em>
          </p>
          <p>We use your personal information for a variety of purposes. In each case, the information we collect and hold is reasonably necessary for our business, including providing you with the services you would expect from us. We use your personal information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Create an account with us:</strong> We need to collect and use your personal information to allow you to create an account and log in to that account. This also includes when you use your Google account to register and log in to our services.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Provide you with our Services:</strong> This includes providing you with access and use of the Culture Amp platform and customer support, which may require us to access your information so that we can assist you with survey design or technical issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Create de-identified aggregated benchmark data:</strong> To provide you with a better understanding of your survey results, we use your survey data in a de-identified aggregated form to compare your results to the results of other surveys. We also use your survey data to continually improve our survey benchmarks. None of your survey data will be disclosed to other unrelated customers in a non-aggregated or identifiable form.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Manage our Services:</strong> We use your information internally to measure and analyze user behaviour so we can provide our Services and improve those Services. Some of these purposes include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Monitoring, maintaining and improving our Services and features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Personalizing or customizing your experience when you use our Services (including presenting our website in the best format for you or a device you use to access our website).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Creating new services or features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Enforcing our Terms when we are made aware of potential breaches.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Preventing potentially illegal, undesirable or abusive activities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Investigating complaints about you, or made by you.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Contact you about services or your account:</strong> At times we may need to contact you via email, mail or telephone to tell you about matters, such as changes to our Services, terms or policies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Contact you for marketing purposes:</strong> We may also send you news and information about our products or Services that you either request from us, or we believe may interest you. In most cases, we will contact you via email.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm:</strong> If we receive a legal request or are informed of a situation that may cause harm, or potential harm, to someone, we may need to inspect your personal information or data to respond appropriately to that request or threat.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <em>Anonymity and pseudonyms</em>
          </p>
          <p>In most cases it will be very difficult for us to provide you with our Services if you do not provide us with your real name and contact details (primarily email). Situations where we might have difficulty interacting with you anonymously, or via a pseudonym, are when you purchase a subscription to our Services or create a survey and send that survey to potential respondents.</p>
          <p>If lawful and practicable, you may use a pseudonym (or simply not identify yourself) when dealing with us. For example, if you have a complaint or concern about our site, or a general question about our Services or this Privacy Policy, you are welcome to contact us without identifying yourself. In some cases, however, if you do not provide us with information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or Services, or respond adequately to you.</p>
          <h4 class="privacy-heading" id="who-has-access-to-your-information">Who has access to your information?</h4>
          <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. To provide you with our Services we will often need to disclose your personal information to our staff or service providers that we use to operate our business. Examples of our service providers include: hosting services; project management software; email service providers; system monitoring services; customer support services; and website analytics. These companies are only authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
          <p>In most cases, the personal information that we disclose to our staff or service providers will be directly necessary to provide our services to you. However, there may be occasions where we may need to disclose your personal information to other people or organizations, including to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Our staff, suppliers or professional advisors:</strong> We may need to disclose your personal information to people who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Enforce or apply our Terms:</strong> If you engage in or threaten any unlawful activity, we may reasonably believe that it is necessary to disclose your information to the police, a relevant authority or enforcement body, or your internet service provider, employer, supervisor or network administrator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Protect our rights or the rights of our staff:</strong> There may be situations where disclosing your information is necessary to protect the property, health or safety of Culture Amp or its staff, customers or others. For example, exchanging information with other organizations to protect against fraud and to reduce credit risk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Keep other entities associated with us informed:</strong> In some cases we may need to disclose your information to our agents, business affiliates, joint venture entities, partners, investors or any applicable subsidiaries or holding companies. The need to disclose your information to these entities may arise from a legal obligation we owe that entity, or to assist our or their legitimate business interests.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Run competitions and promotions:</strong> We may need to disclose your personal information to sponsors and promoters when you enter any competition that we conduct or promote.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Fulfill requests from you:</strong> You may specifically authorize us to disclose your personal information to a third party. For example, to resolve a dispute regarding our Privacy Policy or to integrate a third party service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Comply with legal requests:</strong> In some situations we may be compelled to disclose your information to third parties such as law enforcement officials or to comply with court orders, such as subpoenas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Merger:</strong> If Culture Amp is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also implement reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information we disclose is subject to a privacy policy comparable to our Privacy Policy, or contractual obligations that will provide a comparable level of protection to our Privacy Policy.</p>
