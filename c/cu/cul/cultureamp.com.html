              <p><strong>Demographic data:</strong> In addition to your contact information, some Customers may provide us with additional demographic information so they can better analyze and understand their survey results.

          <p>Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of information.

            <em>Security of your personal information</em>
          </p>
          <p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. All your data is private and confidential and we take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.</p>
          <p>However, please note that transmitting information over the Internet is never completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is absolutely secure in all situations.</p>
          <p>Security is a collaborative effort, so we also recommend that you create a sophisticated password for logging in to our services, and keep that password secret. If you suspect there has been any unauthorized access or misuse of your personal information, immediately contact our <href="#contacting-our-privacy-officer">Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@cultureamp.com">privacy@cultureamp.com</a>.</href="#contacting-our-privacy-officer"></p>

            <em>Where your personal information is located</em>
          </p>
          <p>Our servers are based in the United States, so your personal information will generally be processed and hosted in the United States. However, as some of our offices and service providers are located outside of the United States, there may be times when your personal information may be transferred, disclosed or processed in another country, such as Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, if you contact our Customer Success team for support or questions, any information you provide us in the support request (including personal information such as your name and email address) will be processed and hosted in Ireland by the service provider we use to manage support requests.</p>

          </p>
          <p>If you live in the European Union, we will use the following safeguards to transfer your personal information to a country not currently deemed adequate under applicable data protection law:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>European Union Standard Contractual Clauses:</strong> Culture Amp offers the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses (EU SCC), also known as Model Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the European Union, and other international transfers of information. We also use the EU SCC when transfer your personal information to a member of the Culture Amp Group located in a country not currently deemed adequate under applicable data protection law. A copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating the EU SCC, is available on request.</p>

            <li>
              <p><strong>Customer or Administrators:</strong> When you answer Customer surveys, we will disclose that information to the Customer and Administrators. How your answers are displayed and what information may be used to analyze and report your answers (either in an aggregate or individual form) may vary from survey to survey. It is important that you read the Confidentiality Notice before answering a survey so you understand how your survey answers will be used and the ways they might be shared (if at all).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Share aggregated de-identified data:</strong> We may share aggregated de-identified data for any purpose. For example, we may share aggregated de-identified data with customers, prospects, partners for business or research purposes, such as our survey benchmarks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Fulfill Customer requests:</strong> Because the Customer is the controller of your personal information, we hold and process your personal information on behalf of the Customer. There may be occasions when the Customer instructs us to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as a consultant or a new service provider. If instructed by the Customer to transfer your personal information to a third party, we generally sign a data transfer agreement with the Customer and third party to ensure that they continue to observe the Confidentiality Notice for each survey.</p>
