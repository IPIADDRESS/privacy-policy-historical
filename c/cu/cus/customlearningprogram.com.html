                    <p>Customlearningprogram is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our   Websites, so we want you to know what information we collect when you visit one   of our sites, how we use that information, and how you can update it. We reserve   the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so   please re-visit this page occasionally to check for updates. </p>
                    <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
                      We collect various types of   information from our visitors so we can adjust our site to meet our users' needs   and expectations. Some of this information is collected automatically through   cookies and other information is collected when you register for any of our   online services or when you request information from one of our partners. </p>
                    <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong><br>
                      The types of   information your browser or Internet session automatically sends us each time   you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect, includes: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator. </li>
                      <li>Your Internet domain, e.g., AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc. </li>
                      <li>You computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux. </li>
                      <li>Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our site from,   which of our pages you visit, and where you go as you leave. </li>
                      <li>Your IP address. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This information lets us see how users are finding our sites, and it tells us   which pages are visited the most often so we can make our Websites more useful. </p>
                    <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br>
                      In addition to the   information automatically collected by your browser, we also collect information   that you provide to us when you request information about a particular school or   educational program. </p>
                    <p>Our websites provide users the opportunity to request information from   schools, and to learn about various education opportunities. These information   request sites require users to provide us with contact information (name,   address, phone number, email address, gender, age, work experience, etc.) as   well as information about their interest in one of our educational partners   (universities, colleges, test prep companies, etc.) We collect this information   that you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites   easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have   provided. We provide this contact information that you provide to the   educational partner that you requested information from. Customer interest   information is collected to determine what information the customer wishes to be   sent. </p>
                    <p><strong>How We Use This Information</strong><br>
                      We use the information we   automatically collect to help us better plan our Website to meet your Internet   needs. Information you provide to us is used for marketing purposes, and may   result in follow-up communications. </p>
                    <p>Customlearningprogram may share personally identifiable information with third party   businesses for the purpose of direct marketing, specifically email marketing.   All third parties are bound by the CAN SPAM Act (s.877) of 2003, and are   required to be in full compliance of all consumer opt-out rules and regulations.	 Information collected online may also be stored with information collected from other sources, including offline sources.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Rights Our Obligations</strong><br>
                      The company respects the   privacy of users visiting our sites and will abide by all applicable laws   concerning the release of personal information. On an occasion we may use   certain directory information that we have collected to send you information   about products and services, or updates and other information we think may be of   interest to you.

                    <p>Other than directory information, data you provide to us as you use the   Website will be held in strict confidence by the company and will be used for   company purposes only. </p>
                    <p><strong>Our Security Measures</strong><br>
                      Our Websites have security measures   in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information   under our control. </p>
                    <p><strong>Why We Use "Cookies"</strong><br>
                      When you visit some of our sites, we   use cookies to keep track of your information. This small piece of program code   resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our   request information sites. We do this so you are not required to re-enter your   contact information as you move from one site to another. </p>
                    <p><strong>Links From Our Site To Other Sites </strong><br>
                      Some of our sites may   contain links to other sites external to our sites. When you access these   external Websites, the providers of the sites will have access to certain   information about you. Customlearningprogram is not responsible for the privacy practices   or the content of any Websites which we do not directly control. </p>
                    <p><strong>Definitions</strong><br>
                        <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
                      Data created by a   Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the   Website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the   cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk. </p>
                    <p>The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for which they are valid.   When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to   the Web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would   save that person from typing in the same information all over again when   accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same   browser session. </p>
                    <p>You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies   or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your   browser in the Options or Preferences menu. </p>
                    <p><strong>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</strong><br>
                      This is the address of a   computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have   a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one   that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written   as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2. </p>
                    <p><strong>Browser Session</strong><br>
                      A browser session is defined as the   period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open   the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a   new session. </p>
                    <p><strong>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong><br>
                      The leading   security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser   sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret   key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key   encryption during that session. We also use SSL encryption whenever we display   your personal information (e.g., name and address, scheduled courses, grades). </p>
                    <p><strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong><br>
                      An Internet address. URLs   are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages   within sites. The URL for Customlearningprogram is <a href="http://www.Customlearningprogram.com" target="_blank">www.customlearningprogram.com</a></p>
