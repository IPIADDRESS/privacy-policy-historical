If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you may be directed to a  webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service  providers) and not by Moody‚Äôs. Any Personal Data that you provide through a  Payment Service page will be collected by Payment Service and not by Moody‚Äôs,  and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this  Privacy Policy. Moody‚Äôs has no control over, and is not responsible for,  Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service  Page. &nbsp;Note that in some cases, payment  information is provided directly to Moody‚Äôs and in such cases, the terms of  this Privacy Policy shall apply.</li>
<li>Moody‚Äôs collects Personal Data through various means other  than the Site, including participation at conferences, individual  introductions, and from employers that enroll their employees in our educational  services. From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain  lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be  interested in our products and services. If we acquire such a list for  promotional purposes, whenever &nbsp;practicable, we seek to obtain appropriate  representations from the other party that the listed individuals have consented  to receiving, or are otherwise eligible to receive, promotional messages from  any acquirer of such list in compliance with applicable law. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Personal Data Collected</h3>
<p>We may use Personal Data for the following purposes:
  </p><ul><li> <strong>Educational Service Delivery.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moody‚Äôs shall use your Personal Data for items  related to the delivery of educational services, including but not limited to,  the creation of your student account, the delivery of online or in-person  seminar training and related materials, mentoring and exam services, delivering  testing results, maintaining your student performance and course completion  record and notifying you of updates regarding the educational services.
  </li><li> <strong>Reporting to Regulators.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Moody‚Äôs is requested in various cases to provide information to  securities industry (and other) regulators that our students may be registered  with, seeking registration with or are otherwise governed by (including but not  limited to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada or  ‚ÄúIIROC‚Äù). Moody‚Äôs may provide your Personal Data to such regulators, including  but not limited to, Personal Data sufficient to identify you,&nbsp; your course completion and course performance  information, to the extent that such information is requested by the regulator.
  </li><li> <strong>Other Communications.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may use Personal Data  about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we  believe may be of interest to you. If your employer is a Moody‚Äôs customer, we  may also inform you of such products, programs, services and promotions using  Personal Data about you that your employer provided to Moody‚Äôs. If you would  prefer that we not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the  "Your Choices" section below. However, in accordance with applicable  law, you may continue to receive certain electronic messages for which we do  not require your express consent to send.&nbsp; 
  </li><li> <strong>Promotions.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively,  "Promotions"). We typically ask you for certain Personal Data when  you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the  rules of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain  additional important information about our use of Personal Data about you. To  the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment  of Personal Data about you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and  conditions of such rules shall control. 
  </li><li> <strong>Internal Business Purposes. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also use Personal Data about you for  our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, editorial and feedback  purposes, providing customer support, customizing and improving the content and  layout of the Site, completing business transactions, development of marketing  and promotion plans and materials, statistical analysis of user behavior,  product development, administering individual accounts, and meeting government  regulatory requirements such as sales tax collection, audits, etc.
  </li><li><strong> Administrative Communications.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Subject  to applicable law, &nbsp;we may use Personal  Data to send to you important information regarding the Site, your educational  services, your account status, changes to the educational services terms and conditions,  this Privacy Policy, or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant  to your use of the Site and/or the educational services. Because this  information may be important to your use of the Site and/or your educational  services, you may continue to receive such communications even if you have  elected not to receive some or all of our marketing or other communications, if  it is legally permissible for us to communicate with you in the circumstances.</li></ul>
<h3>Collection and Use of Other Data </h3>
<p>Moody's and its Service Providers may also collect the  following types of data, referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Other  Data":
  </p><ul>
  <li> <strong>Monitoring Data. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moody‚Äôs  and its service providers may collect and/or track other information such as  demographic information, domain names, computer type, browser types, screen  resolution, and other statistical data involving the use of the Site  ("Monitoring Data"). We use Monitoring Data to help us understand who  uses the Site and to improve and market it, as well as our other web sites and  services. <br>
  Unless combined with Personal Data, Monitoring Data does not  personally identify you or any other user, and we may use it for any  purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </li><li> <strong>Aggregated Data. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,  we may aggregate Personal Data in a manner such that the end-product does not  personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using  information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular  telephone area code. Such aggregate information may also be used for any  purpose.<br>
  </li><li> <strong>Cookies.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  enhance the Internet experience on the Site, Moody's and our service providers  may use ‚Äòcookies‚Äô on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to  an individual's computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We use cookies  and other technologies to facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of our  Site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,  there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically  decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the  transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your  computer. If cookies are disabled, however, all features of the Site may not  operate as intended. Information about the procedure you are required to follow  in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider‚Äôs  web site. We expect our service providers to honor any decision by you to block  or disable cookies in connection with the Site.<br>
  </li><li> <strong>Tools. &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;We and our  service providers may also use various common Internet tools such as 'pixel  tags,' ‚Äòaction tags,‚Äô ‚Äòweb beacons,‚Äô ‚Äò.gif tags,‚Äô 'JavaScript' or similar  technologies (together, "Tools") in connection with Site pages and  email messages in certain formats to, among other things, track the actions of  Site users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing  campaigns and to compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Tools  allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver  branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or  advertising campaigns. When used in email messages in certain formats, Tools  can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.<br>
  Moody‚Äôs uses cookies and Tool technologies to understand how  the Site is used and to customize and enhance the Internet experience of  individual users. When you revisit the Site, Moody‚Äôs may recognize you by a  Tool and customize your experience. For example, once you have completed the  registration process, a cookie and/or Tool will be used to avoid having you  register again. We believe cookies and Tool technologies add value to the user  experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </li><li> <strong>IP Addresses.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  you visit and interact with the Site, we and our third-party service providers  may collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Your IP address is a number that  is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet  Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in  our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of  your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use IP addresses to  understand how the Site is used by our users and to improve the Site. Where  required by applicable law, IP addresses will be treated as Personal Data.</li></ul>
<h3>Disclosure of Personal Data Collected</h3>
<p><em>We may disclose Personal Data for the following purposes/to  the following parties:</em></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Paying Employer or Third Party.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your employer (or other third party)  pays for your enrollment and/or participation in any educational services  provided by Moody‚Äôs (either by way of payment directly to Moody‚Äôs or personal  reimbursement to you of amounts paid to Moody‚Äôs), Moody‚Äôs may, from time to  time at the request of such employer or third party, disclose to the employer  or third party your performance data related to the particular educational services&nbsp; that such employer or third party has paid  for. This only applies to the particular employer or third party that paid for  the educational services to which the request for your performance data relates  ‚Äì a request for such performance information made by a subsequent employer or  third party will be denied absent your express consent to such disclosure. To  provide a general consent to disclosure of your performance data to employers  that may request it from time to time, please login to your student profile  through <a href="http://www.csi.ca">www.csi.ca</a> and accept the information  release consent form (the ‚ÄúIRCF‚Äù).<br>
</li><li> <strong>Reporting to Regulators. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulators may request that Moody‚Äôs provide  information about licensed registrants or students who apply to be registered  with the regulator or are otherwise governed by the regulator (including but  not limited to IIROC) and Moody‚Äôs will provide this information. There are also  rare occasions where Moody‚Äôs will report events to&nbsp; IIROC or other such regulators (e.g. in the  case of significant academic infractions).<br>
</li><li><strong> Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may provide Personal Data to third-party  service providers, who provide services to us, including but not limited to,  data analysis, order fulfillment, payment processing, provision of educational  materials, provision of course completion certificates, course instruction  and/or administration, examination and testing administration and other  services of an administrative nature. 
</li><li> <strong>Affiliate Communications. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moody‚Äôs may transfer Personal Data to its  affiliates (the details of which can be found at www.moodys.com) to allow our  affiliates to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions  that they believe may be of interest to you, and such affiliates may otherwise  use your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you would  prefer not to receive marketing communications from Moody‚Äôs or its affiliates,  please see the "Your Choices" section below. Moody‚Äôs will be  responsible for any Personal Data that is transferred to its affiliates. 
</li><li> <strong>Strategic Partners and Co-Branded Sites.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may enter into a  special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated  with Moody‚Äôs to provide or promote joint products, services, applications, or  features (together, ‚ÄúJointly Offered Items‚Äù). These special relationships may  include co-branded web sites (‚Äúco-branded pages‚Äù). Any information, including  Personal Data, that you provide in connection with one of these Jointly Offered  Items, and/or on one of these co-branded pages, will be shared with our  third-party partners. By selecting an application or providing your information  on these co-branded pages, or by signing up to receive information about or  downloading a Jointly Offered Item, you also consent to our providing Personal  Data about you to those third parties. You should check these third parties‚Äô  web sites for information regarding their privacy practices. PLEASE NOTE THAT  THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF  ANY THIRD PARTIES. If you do not want Personal Data about you shared with such  third parties, please do not provide Personal Data in connection with the  Jointly Offered Items and/or co-branded pages.
</li><li> <strong>Promotions.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  may share the Personal Data you provide in connection with Promotions with  third-party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such  Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules  applicable to those Promotions. <br>
</li><li> <strong>Assignment. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  may transfer any and all Personal Data that we collect to an affiliated entity  or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint  venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our  business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any  bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
</li><li><strong> Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose Personal Data about you to  others as we believe to be appropriate: (a) in compliance with laws, rules, or  regulations in any country in which Moody‚Äôs operates; (b) to comply with legal  process; (c) to respond to requests from government or public authorities; (d)  to enforce our Terms and Conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of  any affiliated entities; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property  of Moody‚Äôs, its affiliated entities, you, or others; and (g) to permit us to  pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. For  example, we may, to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose Personal Data  about you to law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals  who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities.

  Qualifications  Publications.&nbsp; From time to time, Moody‚Äôs  may publish lists of individuals (online or otherwise) that have completed  various courses or certificates and/or hold various professional designations  offered and maintained by Moody‚Äôs. Individuals may be identified by their name  and business affiliations in such publications. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other than as set out herein or as may be expressly agreed  by you from time to time, Moody‚Äôs will not distribute your Personal Data and in  no event will we sell your Personal Data.</p>
<h3>Your Choices </h3>

  Note that from time to time, Moody‚Äôs receives education  verification requests from third parties seeking information regarding our  students‚Äô academic records.
