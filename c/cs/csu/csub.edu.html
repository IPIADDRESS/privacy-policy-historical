If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), "personal information" includes all personal data as defined under EEA laws (including "sensitive personal information" which is provided enhanced protections under those laws).</p>
                            <p>We collect personal information about users only as allowed by law and limit the collection of personal information to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose of the University. We collect personal information (and sensitive personal information) that you send to the CSU, or permit us to obtain from third parties, for purposes relevant to CSU operations in pursuit of our academic mission. Examples include information needed for student admission (including financial aid information), employment, housing and dining services, online educational programs, research, health services, donor relations, visa application processing, event registration, parking services, information technology usage and support services, library usage, bookstore operations, and website account registrations. Our legal basis for processing most of this information is to perform a task in the public interest or in fulfillment of CSU official functions, including those set out in the California Education Code and/or Title V of the California Code of Regulations, or under applicable federal law. Other legal bases for processing information include processing necessary for contract (e.g., to process parking permit payments), for legitimate interests (e.g., to send requested information) or consent (e.g., to process certain sensitive personal information).</p>

                            <p>It is the policy of the California State University to limit the collection and safeguard the privacy of personal information collected or maintained by the University.

In the event of a conflict between this Notice and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, FERPA, or other law governing the disclosure of University records, the applicable law will control.</p>
                            <p>Any information acquired by the University through the Sites is subject to the limitations set forth in the Information Practices Act. The University will not distribute or share electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code Section 11015.5) about users to any third party without the permission of the user, except in narrow circumstances set forth in this Notice.

                            <p>When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
                            </p><h3 class="heading-body heading-color">Google Analytics</h3>
                            <p>We use a tool called "Google Analytics," a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited, and what other sites were visited prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Sites. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type of web browser, type of operating system, browser resolution, and network location, however we do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites.</p>
                            <h3 class="heading-body heading-color">Log File Information</h3>
                            <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
                            <h3 class="heading-body heading-color">Clear Gifs Information</h3>
                            <p>When you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.</p>
                            <h3 class="heading-body heading-color">California Do Not Track Disclosures</h3>
                            <p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users' online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.</p>

                            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.</p>
                            <p>We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy and security, please see the University's <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/icsuam/documents/section8000.pdf" target="_blank">policies and procedures related to Information Security</a>; you may also consult with the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy" target="_blank">California Attorney General's Privacy Enforcement and Protection website</a>.</p>
                            <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
