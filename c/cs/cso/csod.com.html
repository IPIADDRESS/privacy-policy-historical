	Website Usage Information
</h1>
<h2>
	1. Cookies
</h2>
<p align="justify">
	<span class="bodytext">When visiting Cornerstone, we may use "cookies" on or in connection with our Website to maintain information about you. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cornerstone employs the use of both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
	When you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Website will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites.
</p>
<p align="justify" class="bodytext">
	Most web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.

<h2>
	2. Clear GIFs
</h2>
<p align="justify">
	When visiting Cornerstone, we may also use "Clear GIFs" (aka "web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies in our Website and/or in our communications with you. A Clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which helps us to verify an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your Personal Information. We use information provided from Clear GIFs to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Cornerstone better for our users.
