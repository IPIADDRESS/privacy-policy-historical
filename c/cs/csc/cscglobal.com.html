We use cookies to elevate your user experience and the quality of our site and service. When you enter our site our web server sends a cookie to your computer which allows us to recognize your computer.</p> <p> By using our site, you consent to our cookie settings and agree that you understand our cookie policy, which explains how you can manage your cookie choices and preferences. Please be aware that restricting cookies will impact your user experience and may prevent you from using part of our website.</p> <p> Cookies can be removed from your browser in two ways: automatically (when they expire), or when you manually delete them. We've included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies we use and how you can manage them.</p> <p> 4.3.2. <strong>Why does Corporation Service Company use cookies? </strong></p> <p> Corporation Service Company's primary reason for using cookies is to make our website work more effectively.</p> <p> 4.3.3. <strong>What kinds of cookies does Corporation Service Company use and why?</strong></p> <ul> <li> Session cookies: These temporary cookies expire and are automatically erased whenever you close your browser. We use session cookies to grant our customers access to content and to enable commenting.</li> <li> Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering our users' preferences and choices when using our site or to target advertising.</li> <li> First- and third-party cookies: Whether a cookie is ‘first' or ‘third' party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. In basic terms, first-party cookies are set by a website visited by the user - the website displayed in the URL window. Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain, such as google.com, other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.</li> <li> Remarketing: Corporation Service Company uses remarketing.
