<p>4.3.1. <strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of code issued to your device when you visit a website, which store and sometimes track information about your use of our site. We use cookies to elevate your user experience and the quality of our site and service. When you enter our site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer, which allows us to recognize your computer.</p>
<p>By using our site, you consent to our cookie settings and agree that you understand our cookie policy, which explains how you can manage your cookie choices and preferences. Please be aware that restricting cookies will impact your user experience and may prevent you from using part of our website.</p>
<p>Cookies can be removed from your browser in two ways: automatically (when they expire), or when you manually delete them. We’ve included more details below to help you understand what kinds of cookies we use and how you can manage them.</p>
<p>4.3.2. <strong>Why does Corporation Service Company use cookies? </strong></p>
<p>CSC’s primary reason for using cookies is to make our website work more effectively.</p>
<p>4.3.3. <strong>What kinds of cookies does Corporation Service Company use and why?</strong></p>

Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain, such as google.com, other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.</li>
<li>Remarketing: CSC uses remarketing. Placing a remarketing tag on our website can help us reach visitors who have previously visited our website as they visit other sites on the Google Display NetworkTM service or search on Google®. Using remarketing, these visitors will be shown messages tailored to which sections of our site they visited. The remarketing tag uses third-party cookies from the Google Display Network. Visitors can opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google Ads settings. Remarketing tags are not used on CSC’s microsites such as <a href="https://www.cscglobal.co.uk">cscglobal.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.cscglobal.de">cscglobal.de</a>, <a href="http://www.cscglobal.es">cscglobal.es</a> and <a href="http://www.cscglobal.fr">cscglobal.fr</a>.</li>

If you access our website in Europe, you can refuse to click the “I accept” box or click the “I disagree” box when you are presented with a cookie notice on our homepage.</p>
<p>When you access our website outside of Europe, our system will automatically issue cookies when you log on to our website (unless you have set your browser to reject them).</p>

<p><strong>U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance Statement </strong></p>
<p><strong>U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance Statement for Data Privacy</strong></p>
<p>At Corporation Service Company (CSC), we recognize the importance of securing the private information of our customers, employees, and business partners, and we strive to safeguard the personal information (defined below) we collect and use. This U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance Statement for Data Privacy (Statement) sets out the privacy principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce as part of the Safe Harbor Framework relating to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States.</p>
<p>CSC complies with the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland. CSC certifies that it adheres to the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view CSC’s certification, please visit www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
<p>CSC complies with these principles insofar as they are applicable to CSC’s business. CSC shall not be responsible for the compliance of its customers in Switzerland or the data privacy laws and regulations of any country.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Certain words and phrases are defined within this Statement. In addition, the words set out below have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Personal information” or “personal data” means any information or set of information that identifies an individual, or could be used by or on behalf of CSC to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information which is encrypted or anonymous.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seven Safe Harbor privacy principles</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Notice – Companies collecting personal data must notify data subjects that they are collecting their personal data, and state the purpose for collecting such data. The company must identify to whom the data will be disclosed and provide notice about how data subjects can contact the company with complaints or questions and how disclosure of their personal information can be limited.</li>
<li>Choice – The data subjects must be given a clear and conspicuous choice to opt-out of allowing their information to be disclosed to third parties or used for a purpose which is incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive information, data subjects must be given the affirmative or explicit choice whether their information is given to a third party or purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual.</li>
<li>Onward transfer of data to third parties – Where a company or organization wishes to transfer information to a third party, it must apply the “notice” and “choice” principles. Where a company or organization wishes to transfer to a third party acting as agent, it may do so if it first either ascertains that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor, is subject to the Swiss or some other qualifying rule, or enters into a written agreement with the third party requiring the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor. If a company meets this requirement, it will not be held responsible if the third party handles data in a way contrary to any restrictions or representations, unless the company knew or should have known that the third party would process the data in such a contrary way and took no reasonable steps to prevent or stop such activity. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with the third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these principles.</li>
<li>Access – Companies must allow data subjects to access their personal data and to correct erroneous information, unless the burden of providing access is greater than the risks associated with the erroneous information or giving access to the information would violate another person’s rights. This requirement is subject to the reasonableness standard. In the event a data subject corrects their personal data, the Company will ensure such changes are updated in the corresponding records storage at CSC.</li>
<li>Security – Companies must take reasonable measures to protect personal information from tampering, destruction, loss, misuse, alteration, disclosure, unauthorized access, and any other potential abuses.</li>
<li>Data integrity – Companies collecting personal data must have reasonable procedures designed to keep the information reliable, accurate, complete, current, and relevant for the lawful purposes for which it was collected.</li>
<li>Enforcement – Three elements are required to satisfy this principle: (a) readily affordable and independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual’s complaints and disputes can be investigated and resolved, and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide; (b) procedures for verifying that the commitments companies make to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the principles. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by the organization.</li>
