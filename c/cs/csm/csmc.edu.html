<div class="redheader">Website Privacy Policy</div>
<p>
<span class="normal"> The Cedars-Sinai Health System ("CSHS") website is owned and operated by Cedars-Sinai Health System. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect information from you or about you online through our website at  </span>
<a href="/" class="normal">www.cedars-sinai.edu</a>
<span class="normal"> ("website"), why we collect this information, how we will use or disclose this information and how you may update or delete identifiable information about you from our records. By accessing, browsing and/or using our website, you are deemed to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you are not willing to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our website.  </span>
</p><p>
<span class="normal"> This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection and use policy or practices offline.   </span>
<span class="bold"> This information is available on the </span>
<a href="/6913.html" class="bold">HIPAA Privacy Practices</a>
<span class="bold"> page. </span>
</p><p>
</p><div class="blackheader">Information Collection and Use</div>
<br>
<span class="normal"> The information we gather generally can be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable. <br>
 </span>
<p>
<span class="normal"> Anonymous (or sometimes referred to as "aggregate") information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. For example, we know how many times our site and certain portions of our site is visited, but we do not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of our visitors unless they specifically provide that information. We use this anonymous information to obtain a better understanding of how visitors use our website and to make decisions on how to improve it. Each time a visitor comes to our site, we collect some information in an effort to improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect the visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from yahoo.com, aol.com etc), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to our website), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). In addition to collecting these types of information, CSHS collects aggregate queries for internal reporting. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within our site, etc.).  </span>
</p><p>
<span class="normal"> Personally identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can respond to your requests. Depending on the portion of the website you visit and the information you provide, this information could range from your name, address and ZIP code, which you provide in order to receive information from us about certain services, to specific health information that you provide to us on an admission form. Personal information collected on our site is used only to allow us to fulfill your request for services. For instance, if you use our online physical system to locate a specialist in your area, we use the information you provide to put you in touch with a physician. Similarly, if you complete an admission form that you download from our site and submit it to us, we use the information contained in your admission form for the purposes of admitting you to CSHS and to thereafter providing the services your physician prescribes. Another example relates to our gift shop. We collect personal information from you in order to complete transactions you request The information you provide may be furnished to a third party in order to facilitate the transaction. Or, you may submit personal information to us in response to an employment opportunity. In each case, we use your personal information only for the purpose it is submitted to us, which may include providing it to third parties with whom we have relationships to deliver the information or services you request.  </span>
</p><p>
<span class="normal"> Our website makes forums and bulletin boards available to our users through our Personal Health Manager. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas become public information and that you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. CSHS reserves the right to disclose or use any user information which is already publicly available or which is posted by the user to a chat room, forum, bulletin board or other public forum.  </span>
</p><p>
<span class="normal"> We also may use the personal information you provide to us to send you information that we believe may be of interest to you, based on information you may have provided to us, including newsletters, information about new medical breakthroughs and other items related to CSHS and its medical community. You do have a right to opt out of receiving this information, as described below in "Your Opt Out Right." You can visit our site without providing any personal information about yourself. However, there are a number of services that we provide which, if you wish to obtain the full benefit of those services, you must provide certain personal information.  </span>
</p><p>
</p><div class="blackheader">Security</div>
<br>
<span class="normal"> We take precautions to ensure your information remains confidential; however, you must keep in mind as you navigate through our website that any message you may send through the website or through email is not secure and may be susceptible to third party interception. As a result, you transmit information to us at your own risk. Select pages within our site, such as those dealing with e-commerce, may run in a secure-server environment. In locations like these, where our website asks you to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. You will be alerted to a secure page by a padlock icon on your browser and/or warning pop-up window.  </span>
<p>
<span class="normal"> We also do everything reasonably possible to protect user information we collect. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information, is restricted in our offices.

If, at a later time, you wish to change your preference, you may do so by contacting us at the address indicated below.  </span>

We encourage you to be cautious when leaving our website and review the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through those websites.  </span>
<p>
</p><div class="blackheader">Children's Privacy Protection</div>
<br>

When we do receive information (with parental consent) from users under the age of 13, we will not share their personally identifiable information with third parties, regardless of their stated preference given at registration.  </span>
<p>
</p><div class="blackheader">Disclosures Required to Investigate Complaints or to Law Enforcement Officials</div>
<br>
<span class="normal"> CSHS may use personal information collected or in its possession to contact users in connection with their inappropriate use of our website, noncompliance with our Terms and Conditions, or in connection with a complaint filed about their use of our site by another user.  </span>
