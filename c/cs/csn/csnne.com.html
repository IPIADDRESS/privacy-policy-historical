<p>The only personal information this web site obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you.

Depending on the event, visitors may be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each web site contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the web site applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions.</p>
<p>We may also offer certain "e-features" that allow visitors to send an e-mail notice to other persons to inform them about activities or events. We may collect the sender’s or the recipient’s e-mail or other personal information with e-features.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers </strong></p>
<p>For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this web site. If we do, entities not affiliated with, owned or operated by us, our parents, partners, or affiliates may handle some of these transactions. We call these entities that may conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "Operational Providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our Operational Providers may request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these Operational Providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider’s terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The Operational Provider may also share your personal information with us.</p>
<p>In most instances, we will request that our Operational Providers adhere to the provisions in this Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors’ personal information with us, unless necessary to complete a visitor’s request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested order. However, you must read an Operational Providers privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online.</p>
<p>Neither we, nor our parents, partners, and affiliates are responsible or liable for the collection, use and disclosure practices or the products or services of Operational Providers.</p>

<p>Our website may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors which are entities that are not owned or operated by us, our parents, partners or subsidiaries. These advertisers and sponsors may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you visit a third party advertiser’s or sponsor’s website you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator. Neither we, nor our parents, partners, and affiliates will be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of third party advertisers and sponsors.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices </strong></p>
<p>This site may use cookies or other tracking devices. A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a web site places on your hard drive when you visit a site. The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site. Cookies do not allow the web site to access personal information that you haven’t already provided. Cookies enable us to track the number of contest and promotion entries, how often visitors are visiting our web site and specific pages, estimate the audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and to track user preferences. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. Please contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your cookies. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this site. However, if you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may find that some areas on the web site will be slower, may not function at all, and/or you may not be able to participate in certain web site activities that require you to log-in or register.</p>
<p>Although we do not intend to use tracking devices to collect personal information, some personal information you provide over the website may be linked to information collected through tracking devices. We do not disclose this combined information to independent third parties. (However, please note that personal information not combined with tracking data may be disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)</p>
<p>Other websites may also use various tracking devices. Neither we, nor our parents, partners, and affiliates are responsible or liable for the tracking device use by other website operators. Visitors must review other website operators’ policies to determine the extent of tracking devices use.</p>
<p><strong>Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Other Parties<br>
</strong><br>
We may share or disclose personal information collected over our web site with other third parties when it is required or authorized by law, when disclosure is necessary to operate the web site or our web site services, to provide or enhance our website features, to complete requested transactions or permit certain web site interactions, to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property, when you consent to the disclosure, when disclosure is consistent with our practices for services that are similarly provided offline, and/or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In the event of a sale or transfer of our assets, including database, personal information may be transferred to other third parties. The recipient of this information may have privacy practices that differ from those in this policy.</p>
<p>We may in the future decide to share visitors’ personal information with additional third parties for other purposes. If we decide to enter into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose in this Privacy Policy the type of personal information that will be shared, the reason we are sharing the information, and whether or how you will have the opportunity to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal information ("opt-out"). We currently conduct joint activities with other entities owned by our parent company; however, we will not share individual visitors’ personal information with these entities for additional purposes unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect the e-mail address and other personal contact information consistent with this Policy. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may share your personal information with Operational Providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the web site, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors. If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this web site and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our Operational Providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.</p>
<p>We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, or additional demographic information. This information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.</p>
<p><strong>How to Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>You may be able to add, change or delete personal information submitted to us over our web site by contacting us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:fsnprivacy@rmhi.com">fsnprivacy@rmhi.com</a>. Certain information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes or in accordance with various laws. We encourage you to keep us informed about any changes to your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Our Security Procedures </strong></p>
<p>We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our web site. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors’ personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. We also utilize additional security features to protect personal information transmitted over our website. If we decide to share visitor personal information with other members of our parent company’s family, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our web site.</p>
<p>Despite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of information stored in our database or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. The Internet subjects all online services to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented. If you use our website to send, receive or post personal or confidential information, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>For the convenience of our visitors, we may offer a list of helpful web site links provided by other entities and/or persons. Neither we, nor our parents and subsidiaries endorse or recommend, nor are we or they responsible or liable for, the products or services, or the privacy policies or terms and usage requirements of any such third party web sites. When you visit other web sites you will be subject to the privacy policies and terms of usage agreements, if any, of that web site operator. You must read the privacy policies of third party website operators to determine their personal information practices</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We will review our security measures and website Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our privacy policies, as we deem appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in a revised Policy available on our website. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p>
<p>We respect the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen. We also offer parents and guardians additional guidelines to help keep your child’s personal information safe and your family’s Internet participation enjoyable. Please see <a href="#parents">Guidelines for Parents</a>.</p>
<p>We have developed this web site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen. Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our web site, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that we have improperly collected personal information from a child under thirteen, or that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child’s membership and/or participation, and delete the child’s personally identifiable information, user name and password from our records.</p>
<p>If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;</li>
<li>To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child’s information;</li>
<li>To fulfill a child’s request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;</li>
<li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and</li>
<li>To protect the security or integrity of the site, to take precautions against liability, to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="parents"></a>Guidelines for Parents</strong></p>
<p>By taking responsibility for your children’s online computer use, parents can greatly minimize any potential risks for being online. The best way to assure that your children are having positive online experiences is to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do this is to spend time with your children while they are online. Have them show you what they are doing and ask them to teach you how to access the services.</p>
<p>While children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they also need parental involvement and supervision in their daily lives. The same general parenting skills that apply to the "real world" also apply while online.</p>
<p>Make it a family rule to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never give out identifying information-home address, school name, or telephone number- in a public message such as chat or bulletin boards, and be sure you’re dealing with someone that both you and your child know and trust before giving it out via email. Think carefully before revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your child’s name if your service allows it.</li>
<li>Get to know the services your child uses. If you don’t know how to log on, get your child to show you. Find out what types of information it offers, and whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable material.</li>
<li>Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child.</li>
<li>Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, or threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider and ask for their assistance.</li>
<li>Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography while online, immediately report this to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678. You should also notify your online service.<br>
    Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can’t see or even hear the person it would be easy for someone to misrepresent him-or herself. Thus, someone indicating that "she" is a "12 year-old girl" could in reality be a 40-year-old man.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer that’s "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house.</p>
<p>Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children. Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to monitor their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of time your children spend on the computer. A child or teenager’s excessive use of online services or bulletin boards, especially late at night, may be a clue that there is a potential problem. Remember that personal computers and online services should not be used as electronic babysitters. Be sure to make this a family activity. Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the child’s bedroom. Get to know their "online friends" just as you get to know all of their other friends .</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.</p>
