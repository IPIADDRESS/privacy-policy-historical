additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each web site contest,
sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the web site
applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental
terms and conditions or privacy provisions.</p>

an e-mail notice to other persons to inform them about activities or
events. We may collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail or other

<p><strong>Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers </strong></p>
<p>For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity
to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this web
site. If we do, entities not affiliated with, owned or operated by us,
our parents, partners, or affiliates may handle some of these
transactions. We call these entities that may conduct our e-commerce
operations and/or order fulfillment "Operational Providers." If you
choose to use these optional services, our Operational Providers may
request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The
voluntary submission of your personal information to these Operational
Providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the
specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate
an order or request, we may share your personal information with the
provider. The Operational Provider may also share your personal
information with us.</p>
<p>In most instances, we will request that our Operational Providers
adhere to the provisions in this Privacy Policy and that such providers
only share visitors' personal information with us, unless necessary to
complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these
providers only use the personal information for the purpose of
conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested order. However, you
must read an Operational Providers privacy policy to determine the
extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected
online.</p>
<p>Neither we, nor our parents, partners, and affiliates are
responsible or liable for the collection, use and disclosure practices
or the products or services of Operational Providers.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors</strong></p>
<p>Our website may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements,
and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors which are
entities that are not owned or operated by us, our parents, partners or
subsidiaries. These advertisers and sponsors may independently solicit
and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our
visitors. Please be advised that when you visit a third party
advertiser's or sponsor's website you will be subject to the privacy
policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator. Neither
we, nor our parents, partners, and affiliates will be responsible for
advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities,
information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of
third party advertisers and sponsors.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices </strong></p>
<p>This site may use cookies or other tracking devices. A cookie is a
small data file that contains a unique identification number that a web
site places on your hard drive when you visit a site. The "cookie" is
able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of
browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain
site. Cookies do not allow the web site to access personal information
that you haven't already provided. Cookies enable us to track the
number of contest and promotion entries, how often visitors are
visiting our web site and specific pages, estimate the audience size
for sponsors and advertisers, and to track user preferences. You can
refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. Please
contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your
cookies. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this
site. However, if you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may
find that some areas on the web site will be slower, may not function
at all, and/or you may not be able to participate in certain web site
activities that require you to log-in or register.</p>
<p>Although we do not intend to use tracking devices to collect
personal information, some personal information you provide over the
website may be linked to information collected through tracking
devices. We do not disclose this combined information to independent
third parties. (However, please note that personal information not
combined with tracking data may be disclosed in accordance with this
Privacy Policy.)</p>
<p>Other websites may also use various tracking devices. Neither we,
nor our parents, partners, and affiliates are responsible or liable for
the tracking device use by other website operators. Visitors must
review other website operators' policies to determine the extent of
tracking devices use.</p>
<p><strong>Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Other Parties<br>
</strong><br>
We may share or disclose personal information collected over our web
site with other third parties when it is required or authorized by law,
when disclosure is necessary to operate the web site or our web site
services, to provide or enhance our website features, to complete
requested transactions or permit certain web site interactions, to
protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property, when you
consent to the disclosure, when disclosure is consistent with our
practices for services that are similarly provided offline, and/or as
otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In the event of a sale or transfer of our assets, including
database, personal information may be transferred to other third
parties. The recipient of this information may have privacy practices
that differ from those in this policy.</p>
<p>We may in the future decide to share visitors' personal information
with additional third parties for other purposes. If we decide to enter
into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose in this Privacy Policy
the type of personal information that will be shared, the reason we are
sharing the information, and whether or how you will have the
opportunity to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal
information ("opt-out"). We currently conduct joint activities with
other entities owned by our parent company; however, we will not share
individual visitors' personal information with these entities for
additional purposes unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect the e-mail
address and other personal contact information consistent with this
Policy. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other
persons. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may share your
personal information with Operational Providers or those persons,
companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of
the web site, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and
technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors. If you are
purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this web site and use a
credit card to complete the transaction, our Operational Providers may
share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket
agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company
in order to complete your order.</p>
<p>We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our
advertisers, sponsors, partners, and affiliates, such as how many
persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our
visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our
visitors, or additional demographic information. This information does
not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may
obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other
sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal
information about a specific visitor.</p>
<p><strong>How to Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information </strong></p>

<p><strong>Our Security Procedures </strong></p>
<p>We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information
collected over our web site. Only employees and supervisors with
specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors'
personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility.
We also utilize additional security features to protect personal
information transmitted over our website. If we decide to share visitor
personal information with other members of our parent company's family,
the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of
personal information collected over our web site.</p>
<p>Despite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of
information stored in our database or that unauthorized parties will
not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. The
Internet subjects all online services to the risk of unauthorized
access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented.
If you use our website to send, receive or post personal or
confidential information, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>For the convenience of our visitors, we may offer a list of helpful
web site links provided by other entities and/or persons. Neither we,
nor our parents and subsidiaries endorse or recommend, nor are we or
they responsible or liable for, the products or services, or the
privacy policies or terms and usage requirements of any such third
party web sites. When you visit other web sites you will be subject to
the privacy policies and terms of usage agreements, if any, of that web
site operator. You must read the privacy policies of third party
website operators to determine their personal information practices</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We will review our security measures and website Privacy Policy on a
periodic basis, and we may modify our privacy policies, as we deem
appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add
new services or features and will post these changes in a revised
Policy available on our website. We encourage you to review our Privacy
Policy on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p>
<p>We respect the privacy of your child and we want to share with you
our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen. We also
offer parents and guardians additional guidelines to help keep your
child's personal information safe and your family's Internet
participation enjoyable.</p>
<p>We have developed this web site to appeal to visitors over the age
of thirteen. Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our web
site, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons
under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or
guardian, or discovery by other means, that we have improperly
collected personal information from a child under thirteen, or that a
child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using
false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership
and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable
information, user name and password from our records.</p>
<p>If we decide to request information from children, we will require
verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information
from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following
circumstances allowed by law:<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information;<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-To
fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper,
magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify
the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-To
protect the security or integrity of the site, to take precautions
against liability, to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant
from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.</p>

<p><strong><a name="parents"></a>Guidelines for Parents</strong></p>
<p>By taking responsibility for your children's online computer use,
parents can greatly minimize any potential risks for being online. The
best way to assure that your children are having positive online
experiences is to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do
this is to spend time with your children while they are online. Have
them show you what they are doing and ask them to teach you how to
access the services.</p>
<p>While children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they
also need parental involvement and supervision in their daily lives.
The same general parenting skills that apply to the "real world" also
apply while online.</p>
<p>Make it a family rule to:<br></p><p><br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-Never give out identifying information-home address,
school name, or telephone number- in a public message such as chat or
bulletin boards, and be sure you're dealing with someone that both you
and your child know and trust before giving it out via email. Think
carefully before revealing any personal information such as age,
marital status, or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or
unlisting your child's name if your service allows it.<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-Get
to know the services your child uses. If you don't know how to log on,
get your child to show you. Find out what types of information it
offers, and whether there are ways for parents to block out
objectionable material.<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-Never allow a child to arrange a
face-to-face meeting with another computer user without parental
permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public
spot, and be sure to accompany your child.<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-Never respond
to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, obscene,
belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage
your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or
your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, or
threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider and
ask for their assistance.<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-Should you become aware of the
transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography while online,
immediately report this to the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678. You should also notify
your online service.<br></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">-Remember that people online may not be who
they seem. Because you can't see or even hear the person it would be
easy for someone to misrepresent him-or herself. Thus, someone
indicating that "she" is a "12 year-old girl" could in reality be a
40-year-old man.</p>

<p>Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer
that's "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any
offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit
your house.</p>
<p>Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your
children. Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a
reminder. Remember to monitor their compliance with these rules,
especially when it comes to the amount of time your children spend on
the computer. A child or teenager's excessive use of online services or
bulletin boards, especially late at night, may be a clue that there is
a potential problem. Remember that personal computers and online
services should not be used as electronic babysitters. Be sure to make
this a family activity. Consider keeping the computer in a family room
rather than the child's bedroom. Get to know their "online friends"
just as you get to know all of their other friends .</p>
