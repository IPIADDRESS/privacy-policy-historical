        users, you can choose to store temporarily your search results on our 
        Web server by using your e-mail address. CSA does not use this address 
        for any other purpose, and you can delete the search results at any time, 
        which automatically removes your e-mail address from our system. We do 
        track database usage, page visits, and searches made for the purposes 
        of providing aggregated statistical information to our customers and information 
        partners. These tracking functions are done at the organizational customer

        occasions when you volunteer information about yourself. For instance, 
        when you complete any of our registration forms on our Web site you will 
        be giving us information about your role as a representative of your organization. 
        User-specific information volunteered by you in these instances is archived 
        for CSA marketing and sales use only. CSA does not sell, rent or lease 
        its customer lists to third parties. Additionally, when you initiate contact 
        with CSA through our Web site or by e-mail, you will be supplying us with 
        information about what your concerns are, as well as how to contact you. 
        CSA may want to use the information you provide to respond to you and 
        to continue to contact you in the future. If you do not want CSA to contact 
        you, you can choose to "opt out," and CSA will respect your 
        wishes.<br>
