        <p>This CrossLoop privacy policy  (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) is intended to inform you of the policies and  practices of CrossLoop, Inc. (“<strong>CrossLoop</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”)  regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. &nbsp;Unless otherwise defined herein, certain  capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Terms  of Use available at <a href="/ipage.htm?id=termsofservice">http://www.crossloop.com/ipage.htm?id=termsofservice</a>, which are  hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Certain Definitions</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>“Contact </strong><strong>Information”</strong> means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including,  for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address.</p>
        <p><strong>“Personal  Information”</strong> is any information about you that is associated with or linked to your Account  Information.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><strong>“Account Information”</strong> means Personal Information that we collect  during your registration for the CrossLoop Services and the creation of your  Account profile, which may include your Contact Information, password for your  account and password hint question, your screen name (“Screen Name”), your  location, and email preferences. Account Information includes Personal  Information we receive (if any) from any affiliate of, or entity related to,  CrossLoop,&nbsp; with which you have  registered. &nbsp;We may also ask you to  provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting  up your Account.&nbsp; For example, once you  have established an Account, you may provide additional information about  yourself in the “Profile” section to describe your technical skills and  professional experience, provide your location and language, and upload a photo  of yourself, all of which will be deemed Account Information.&nbsp; Providing this additional Account Information  is optional, but it enables you to better identify yourself and market your  technical support services to other users.<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>“Anonymous  Information”</strong> means information that is not associated with or linked to  your Contact Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the  identification of individual persons. </p>
        <p><strong><u>User Consent</u></strong><br>
          By using the CrossLoop  Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly  consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this  Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>If you are a User who resides outside of the United States,  you understand that your Personal Information may be processed in countries  (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information  may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Personal  Information You Provide to Us</u></strong><br>
          When you register to use  the CrossLoop Services, we collect your Account Information.&nbsp; When you leave us feedback, we will collect  any information that is contained in your feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you contact us by sending us an e-mail,  fax, or letter, we will collect your address, fax number, or e-mail address and  any information contained in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us.&nbsp; In addition, we collect transactional  information based on your activities on the CrossLoop Services such as  providing and receiving technical support and content you generate or that  relates to your Account.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,  we collect the feedback and ratings you provide after using the CrossLoop  Services, your stated role or purpose for use of the services, and the number  of sessions in which you use the CrossLoop Services.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
        <p>Your Screen Name  is displayed throughout the CrossLoop Services and is therefore available to  the public. All of your activity through the CrossLoop Services is traceable to  your Screen Name. Other people can see your ratings and associated comments,  feedback, technical support expertise, and so on.&nbsp; We may send notices to other community  members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites and  refer to Screen Names in such notices. Therefore, if you associate your name  with your Screen Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be  able to personally identify your activities in connection with the CrossLoop  Service. </p>
        <p><strong><u>Personal  Information Collected via Technology </u></strong><br>
          As you use the CrossLoop  Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your  Internet protocol address, browser type and language, screen resolution, and  operating system. CrossLoop may also store a small text file called a “Cookie”  on your computer to store your login information. CrossLoop may use both  session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent  Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). </p>
        <p>An “<strong>Internet protocol  address</strong>” or “<strong>IP Address</strong>” is a number that is automatically assigned  to your computer when you use the Internet.&nbsp;  CrossLoop may track the IP addresses used for sessions and store this  information for security reasons and for the purpose of identifying any misuse  of the CrossLoop Services.<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Use of Information</u></strong><br>
          We use your Personal  Information to provide the CrossLoop Services to you, to respond to requests  that you make, to improve the CrossLoop Services, and to better tailor the  features, performance and support of the CrossLoop Services.&nbsp; Without limiting the foregoing, certain of  your Personal Information may be included in a CrossLoop Badge (”Badge”), which  is a widget and an optional service we provide to help you publish your  CrossLoop profile on other sites, blogs and social networks in order to promote  yourself and your technical skills.&nbsp; At  your request, we will publish the Personal Information contained in your Badge  and distribute the information to third party websites, including blogs and  social profiles, and third parties will be able to contact you through a link  on your Badge.</p>
        <p>We may use your Personal  Information to send you electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, unless you  have requested not to receive such promotional communications from us.&nbsp; We  may also use your Personal Information to send you communications related to  the CrossLoop Services.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
        <p>We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by  excluding your Contact Information (which makes the information personally identifiable  to you).&nbsp; We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third  parties in our discretion. </p>
        <p><strong><u>Spam</u></strong><br>
          CrossLoop  does not tolerate or advocate the sending of any unsolicited commercial emails  or spam. You may not add any other user of the CrossLoop Services, even a user  who has received technical support from you, to your mailing list (email or  physical mail) without that user’s express consent. To report CrossLoop-related  spam or spoof emails to CrossLoop, please forward the email to  <a href="mailto:customersupport@crossloop.com">customersupport@crossloop.com</a>.&nbsp; You may  not use any communication tools provided through the CrossLoop Services to send  spam or otherwise send content that would violate this Privacy Policy or the  Agreement. </p>
        <p><strong><u>Feedback</u></strong><br>
          If you provide feedback to  us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided that,  except as expressly contemplated in this Privacy Policy, we do not associate  such feedback with your Contact Information.&nbsp;  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if you provide session feedback about  your use of the CrossLoop Services, we shall display such feedback on the  Website together with your Screen Name and/or photograph, and (b) if another  user provides feedback about his experience with you, we shall display that  feedback together with your Screen Name and/or photograph.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Disclosure of Personal Information</u></strong><br>
          Except as otherwise  stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information  with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so. </p>
        <p>We may provide your  Personal Information to third party service providers who work on behalf of or  with us to provide the CrossLoop Services.&nbsp;  However, these service providers do not have any independent right to  share this information (except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a  subpoena or warrant). </p>
        <p>We may share some or all  of your Personal Information with our Affiliates (“<strong>Affiliates</strong>” are  parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a  common control), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
        <p>If our company or our  assets related to this Privacy Policy are acquired by another company, that  company may possess the Personal Information collected by us and in such case it  will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as  described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Law Enforcement Compliance</u></strong></p>
        <p>We may, and you hereby  authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information if required by law, to any  enforcement officers acting under the color of law, or if we believe in good  faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to  respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or defend the  rights, property, or safety of CrossLoop, you, other users, or third parties.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Your Choices Regarding  Your Personal Information</u></strong><br>
          We  offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal  Information. When you receive promotional communications from us, you may  indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from  us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe  instructions provided in the promotional e-mail you receive or by contacting us  directly (please see contact information below).<br>
          Despite  your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative e-mails  regarding the &nbsp;CrossLoop Services,  including, for example, purchase confirmation, account creation confirmation,  and notices of updates to our Agreement or Privacy Policy. &nbsp;<br>
          You  may review and/or change any of your Account Information by editing it in your  Account page.&nbsp; You may also change the  settings for your Account by editing the information under the settings tab.  You may request the termination of your Account and deletion of your Account  Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or  otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this  information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion  request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).&nbsp;&nbsp; You may make such termination requests by  sending an email request to <a href="mailto:customersupport@crossloop.com">customersupport@crossloop.com</a>, provided that you  should send your request using the email account that you have registered for  your Account.&nbsp; When CrossLoop deletes  Account Information, it will be deleted from the active database but may remain  in CrossLoop’s archives.<strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Regarding Children</u></strong><br>
          We do not intentionally  gather Personal Information about Users who are under the age of 13.</p>

Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not  apply to these outside websites.</p>

If you disclose  your information to others, whether they are users of the CrossLoop Services or  other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or  disclosure of the information you disclose to them.
