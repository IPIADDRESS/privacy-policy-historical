<h1>CROSSLOOP PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>CrossLoop respects your privacy. When using our sites, you may get information, access online products and services, communicate with us or link to other Web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our website. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Individual Identifying Information that you share with us. "Individual Identifying Information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title and mailing address. </p>
<p>This policy governs Web-sites owned and operated by CrossLoop, Inc. Our policy does not govern Web-sites of other parties to which we may provide links, because CrossLoop is not responsible, and can not control the privacy practices or content of those sites. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading communication industry privacy guidelines. </p>
<p>We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web sites: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN </strong></p>
<p> Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the Site unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this Site in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong> </p>
<p>CrossLoop collects Individual Identifying Information when you register for an CrossLoop account, or use certain CrossLoop products or services, when you visit CrossLoop pages, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. CrossLoop may also receive Individual Identifying Information from our business partners. </p>
<p>CrossLoop also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, CrossLoop cookie information and the page you requested. </p>
<p> CrossLoop uses information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products. </p>
<p> CrossLoop routinely time-stamps and logs events (like features used, participants, length of sessions.) This data is used for performance tuning and optimization of the CrossLoop services. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</strong> </p>
<p>CrossLoop will not sell or rent your Individual Identifying Information to anyone. </p>
<p> CrossLoop will send Individual Identifying Information about you to other companies or people when: </p>
<p> We have your consent to share the information; </p>
<p> We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; </p>
<p> We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of CrossLoop to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Individual Identifying Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); </p>
<p> We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or </p>
<p> We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the CrossLoop Terms of Service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>USE OF EMAIL TOOLS </strong></p>
<p> You may not use the Tell a Friend service or other email services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Service. We do not permanently store email messages or the email addresses sent from these tools. </p>
<p> If you send an email using the Tell a Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our community, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MAILING LISTS </strong></p>
<p> CrossLoop respects your privacy and will not sell or rent your email address. To unsubscribe to any of our mailing lists, simply send an email to <a href="mailto:info@crossloop.com">info@CrossLoop.com</a> using the subscribed email address with "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject bar. If you wish to change your email address, it may be easier to simply unsubscribe using your current email address and re-subscribe using your new address. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES </strong></p>
<p>CrossLoop receives IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a Web page. </p>
<p> Your IP address is also stored in our user registration databases when you register with CrossLoop. </p>
<p> When an CrossLoop Web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page. </p>
<p> IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to: </p>
<p> Diagnose service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific Web company or ISP. </p>
<p>Send the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or information derived from your IP address. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers. 
</p>
<p>      Estimate the total number of users visiting CrossLoop from specific countries or regions of the world. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>COOKIES </strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. </p>
<p> Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. </p>
<p><em> Choices about cookies <br>
</em>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) </p>
<p> If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use CrossLoop products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many CrossLoop products and services do not require that you accept cookies. </p>
<p><em> CrossLoop’s practices regarding cookies <br>
</em>CrossLoop uses cookies for a number of purposes, including to: <br>
- 
Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide you with customized content. <br>
- Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using CrossLoop's services. <br>
- Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on CrossLoop. <br>
- Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic. <br>
- 
Conduct research to improve CrossLoop's content and services. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>DATA STORAGE </strong></p>
<p><em>Account Information <br>
</em>When you register with CrossLoop or submit information to CrossLoop, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human error. </p>
<p><em>Servers <br>
</em>The CrossLoop computers (called "servers") that send you Web pages and advertising banners process and store an enormous amount of information every day. These computer records are called "log files." Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes, as described above. </p>
<p><em>Security</em><br>
We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption and "firewalls". We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY </strong></p>
<p>If we change any of our privacy policies or practices, we'll post those changes to this policy statement at least 30 days before they take effect. In limited cases, we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>CONTACT US </strong></p>
<p> If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can complete a <a href="http://www.crossloop.com/contactus.html">feedback form</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:info@crossloop.com">info@CrossLoop.com</a>. </p>
