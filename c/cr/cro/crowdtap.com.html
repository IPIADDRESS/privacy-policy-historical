        <h1>Crowdtap Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Crowdtap, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;(“Crowdtap”, “Company”, “we” or “us”), the operator of this web site, is committed to preserving the privacy of those who visit our www.crowdtap.com website (“Site”). Crowdtap has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to helping you better understand what information we collect about you and what may happen to that information during your visit to the Site.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected at this Site.  By using or accessing the Site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy.  <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE. </strong>
</p>
<h2>Information Collected</h2>
<p>
  When using the Site, in order to utilize some of the services, you may be asked to provide, or you may choose to upload, certain personally identifiable information about yourself ("Personal Information"). Personal Information can include your name, occupation, photo, e-mail address, address, phone number(s), Facebook profile, Twitter handle, selected interests, or date of birth.  Please note that Personal Information may also include personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide when you take a survey or a poll or enter a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, browser type and other data, and may aggregate any Personal Information collected, such as demographic information, in a manner which does not identify any one person ("Aggregate Information"). Survey answers and influencer scores that are not connected to Personal Information may also constitute Aggregate Information.
</p>
<h2>Information Usage</h2>
<p>
  We may share your Personal Information with our clients, affiliates, charity partners, technical consultants, third party auditors or other third parties who compile the Aggregate Information, make our Site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or who process your orders and/or deliver content, samples, supplies, products, or services.  For example, we may share your Personal Information with a vendor to fulfill any incentive or reward which you have elected to receive and that vendor may forward your email address to a third party to redeem any rewards.  You may opt-out at any time in accordance with the "Terminating Membership" section below.
</p>
<p>
  We may use your Aggregate Information to do such things as operate our Site, enhance our Site, and for market research purposes. We may share Aggregate Information with our clients, affiliates, charity partners and other third parties for advertising, promotional and other purposes.  Individual answers from you to questions within Programs marked as “confidential” may be shared with our affiliates, clients and business partners but those answers will not be labeled with, or linked to, your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
  Your user name, zip code, Crowdtap Points, profile photo, badges and levels earned, and some of your activity may be shared with other Crowdtap users within the Site, including without limitation publication in a live feed of ongoing activities and leader boards.  You may also see such information related to other Crowdtap Members when logged into the Site.
</p>
<p>
  On the Site, Crowdtap, its clients and some of its business partners will have the ability to contact You regarding Programs or Rewards for which you qualify.  We hereby disclaim all responsibility and liability should a client contact You directly by virtue of your posting of Personal Information on the Site in a section of the Site where it was not explicitly requested, or outside the Site, which is viewable and/or accessible by clients of Crowdtap (e.g., contact information listed within feedback you provide, information on your Facebook profile liked to your Crowdtap account, an email address you provided directly to one of Crowdtap’s clients).
</p>
<p>
  We will never rent or sell your Personal Information to any third party without your consent.  Please note that we reserve the right to and may disclose Personal Information about you in response to (a) requests from local, state or federal law enforcement officials; (b) any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as subpoena; (c) if required by law; or (d) to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, physical threats, or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.  Please also note that we do reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of site assets.
  Information obtained in connection with the Site may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.
</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>

During registration, a member may be required to provide their contact information (including, but not limited to, name, e-mail address, and postal address), Facebook user information, additional psychographic information, and information needed for delivering Crowdtap Rewards once redeemed.  This information is used to notify the member about new Programs, Crowdtap Rewards, and changes in Crowdtap Reward offerings. In addition, we may ask members to provide legitimate proof of address. Proof of address is required in order to guard Crowdtap from fraudulent activities. This information is also used for shipping purposes for prizes redeemed by members.
</p>
<h2>Your Account</h2>
<p>
  Once you become a member of Crowdtap, you will receive a password and an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, as well as your Facebook username and password which may be used through Facebook Connect. Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose such password or account information to any third parties. If you choose to share this information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account information and password and therefore should review each third party's privacy policy.

Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.

</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>

</p>
<h2>Clickstream</h2>
<p>
  As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data", can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site.  We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.  This information will be used to improve our Site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any Personal Information.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Crowdtap will not be liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.  We have undertaken all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized Internet access to visitor data retained in our servers, however, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, Crowdtap cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk.  You must accept all risks associated with any data transmission, including the risk that their personal information may be intercepted in transit.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p>

<h2>Special Offers and e-mail</h2>
<p>
Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new Programs, Crowdtap Rewards, and directives from Crowdtap if they have opted-in. "Opted-in" means the member has approved certain e-mails to be sent to them from Crowdtap.
</p>

<h2>Crowdtap Site and Service Announcements</h2>

<p>
Under certain circumstances Crowdtap may need to contact specific or all members in order to make an important announcement about the Site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or "opt-in/opt-out" of these announcements because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, Crowdtap will post information regarding changes directly on the Site.
