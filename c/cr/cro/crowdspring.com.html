Simply put: there's nothing unique, custom or brilliant about instant logos when you create your own logo design using a logo maker, pre-made logo templates, or when those logos are created by an AI computer from templates.</p><p>Crowdspring is different. We help clients get the perfect custom logo online at an affordable price, designed by professional logo designers using a dramatically simple logo design process. You'll pick from many different logo design concepts made to your requirements. It's never been easier to get the perfect logo - designed by experienced graphic designers - that will wow your customers and set you apart from your competitors.</p><p>We have everything you need in one place (project management, designer discovery, feedback, file transfers, IP protections for the work you're buying, award-winning customer support, and more). You'll get full commercial and usage rights for your custom logo as part of a written, custom legal agreement transferring those rights to you.</p><p>The crowdspring platform is trusted by tens of thousands of the world's best agencies, businesses and brands.

And while it may seem obvious to some why it’s important to invest in a well-designed logo, many entrepreneurs and small business owners don’t really understand why logos are so important.</p><p>In the simplest of terms, a logo is a graphic mark, emblem design, icon, or mark that identifies your company, organization, or you. If you run a business, your brand is more than just your <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/naming-a-business-or-product/' target='_blank'>company name</a> and logo, but a logo is an important part of a company’s brand. It’s the visual cornerstone of the brand.</p><p>The most important job of a logo is to help customers and customer prospects identify your company. That’s why the best logos are simple and memorable. Just think about how many logos you are able to recognize in your everyday life! Those logos serve as a reminder that Nike was the brand that made your shoes, or that Apple is the reason why you’re reading this on a Macbook.</p><p>Another important job of a logo is to draw attention to your organization and its products and/or services. Logos don’t only identify what your company does or stands for, but they also catch people’s eyes. People remember great logos! Again, it’s all about association. If people associate a specific symbol or font with your brand, then they will instantly recognize it wherever they are. It's one reason why businesses regularly use their logos on social networks and in social media.</p><p>One of the best parts of a logo, assuming you’re not using generic templates or a free logo site, is that it can only be associated with your business. It doesn’t matter if a different company is similar to yours, what matters is that your logos are different. Your logo must be your own. You have an opportunity to make a unique first impression and you can only do that with a custom logo. Often, a logo is one of the first defense barriers against competition. Besides your company’s name, it’s the first difference customers and prospects will notice. That’s why it’s important to avoid generic and cliche logos.</p>","question":"Why have a logo?"},{"answer":"<p>There are a number of important characteristics of a good logo design. A logo should be simple, memorable, timeless and unique. You want people to remember your brand and the logo is often the first connection your company will have with prospective customers.</p>","question":"What makes a good logo design?"},{"answer":"<p>A logo's flexibility is extremely important. There are so many mediums in which your logo will be employed: digital, print, physical products... it's important that your logo looks great when used in each.</p><p>If your company uses a logo that solely relies on color, your logo will lose it’s effect when it’s in black and white. Similarly, if your company intends to only use your logo in a specific way (such as on a web design, signage, shirts, letterhead, stationery, custom t-shirts, decals, or business cards), then size may not matter much. But if you’re like most companies, you’ll need a flexible logo that can be placed on multiple products, presentations, graphics, and websites. Versatility is important because it helps you reproduce your logo in a wide variety of ways.</p><p>The most successful logos are flexible enough that they don’t get lost when changing sizes, backgrounds, or mediums.</p>","question":"Should a logo be flexible?"},{"answer":"<p>The distinction between an overly simplistic design and a minimalist design is an important one. Overly simplistic, generic designs should be avoided, as they tend toward being overused, overdone, and not at all memorable. Minimalist designs, on the other hand, are popular for good reason. They are eye-catching, memorable, and timeless, but still function as creative pieces.</p><p>The minimalism trend grounds most of the other current trends, which are increasingly focused on sleek, tight designs. Ornate, overworked design has been replaced with cleaner, modern concepts that retain simplicity without forgoing originality.</p><p>One reason for minimal design’s broad-based appeal? Any business can incorporate a minimal look into their existing design scheme! If you find that your existing brand is tired and out of touch, maybe it’s time to take a look at what other businesses are doing with minimalist design on crowdspring.</p>","question":"Should a logo be simple?"},{"answer":"<p>The most memorable logos - like Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola and Target - have key characteristics in common with each other. These logos are all clean, memorable, and foster positive brand associations for their customers. Consumers are more likely to associate positive attributes to logos that incorporate memorable design elements, and find brands with these characteristics in their logos to be attractive, trustworthy, and respectable. Those are qualities worth remembering!</p>","question":"Should a logo be memorable?"},{"answer":"<p>A brand’s logo is its principal design element, acting as a visual representation of the company and its values. There are plenty of things that go into a well-designed logo, but one of the most important of these is color. It may seem like an artistic decision, but the primary color you choose for your logo actually has a serious psychological impact on how people perceive it.</p><p>In a widely-cited study called “The Impact of Color on Marketing,” research found that people make a subconscious judgment about products within the first 90 seconds of seeing it. Consumers place color above other factors such as sound, smell and texture. Almost 85% of consumers cite color as the main reason they buy a certain product, and 80% of people believe color increases brand recognition.</p><p>Even if they’re not consciously thinking about it, people associate color with different things and feelings. Making sure your brand effectively capitalizes on positive color association will make the difference in how impactful your logo is.</p>","question":"Are logo colors important?"},{"answer":"<p>A great logo walks the line between timelessness and trendiness: designing a logo that is both can be a challenge. A logo that’s unique, attractive, and adeptly communicates your brand values requires an understanding of the current design trends and the skill to use them to your best advantage.</p><p>Finding a designer who can assess the personality of your brand and convey it in a timeless logo isn't out of reach. Here at crowdspring, we have hundreds of thousands of designers equipped with the knowledge of current design trends, and the ability to incorporate them into a logo that is modern, relevant, but still timeless.</p>","question":"Should a logo be timeless?"},{"answer":"<p>Yes. A unique logo design can be the difference between blending in and standing out from the competition. Generic logos have become extremely problematic. That's why in the long run, a free logo will end up costing you much more in brand value and confusion than paying a few hundred dollars for a professional designed one.</p><p>The epidemic of too-similar fonts, glyphs, and swishy people leaves a weak first impression on customers and is unmemorable. Even though some of these generic logos may help a person identify the industry itself, generic logos also detract from the originality and story of your specific company. Generic logos even break the core elements of good logo design: memorable and unique, making them poor choices for any company. Imagine if you're a photographer looking for a photography logo for your business and you end up with a design that looks like a thousand other photographer logos. That will make it impossible for you to stand out.</p><p>The inspiration for a logo can come from a number of places: nature, experiences, other logos, the list is never ending. But the best, most original logos draw inspiration from what the company does or values. Whatever makes your company unique and stand out from competitors will also make your logo unique.</p>","question":"Should a logo design be unique?"},{"answer":"<p>Good logos are not just about creative illustrations and drawings! Many companies use typography in their logos either instead of or in addition to images and symbols.</p><p>When incorporating words or phrases, logos often play with the font, style, size, and even letter spacing. Some logos include the company’s full name, while some just include an initial. Some don’t include any letters or words at all, but traditionally use a specific text style for those elements. Either way, typography including the choice of serif or sans serif fonts and typefaces, is essential to making the words behind your company synergize with the other graphic elements of the logo. Can it be read at small sizes? Is the letterspacing/word spacing well adjusted? Typography is a craft in itself - it's the first voice of stating who you are.</p>","question":"How important is typography in the design of a great logo?"},{"answer":"<p>Is your logo going to be printed on paper? Business cards? Billboards? Physical products? Today, there are a lot of mediums and sizes and our logos have to perform well across all mediums. Therefore it’s important to consider where and how your logo will be displayed so that you can specify colors and file formats. At crowdspring, we have you covered by making sure you receive vectorized logo designs, which are useful in any medium.</p><p>You should always request vector based graphics. It's often tempting to ask for complex illustrations in a logo. However, unless you plan on never using your logo outside of an on-screen/online application, a JPG or PSD isn't going to cut it. A properly drawn vector design in an SVG, EPS or compatible format will provide you with the ultimate flexibility.</p>","question":"Why do you need vector files for your logo?"},{"answer":"<p>Instead of copying or mimicking famous logos, the best designers look to create a unique brand when creating a business logo or a logo for another type of organization. The breakthrough designs they create often come from the deeper meanings they find within the company, which is the reason why so many companies have logo origin stories or hidden meanings.</p><p>The secret is to uncover that deeper or hidden meaning before designing the logo. A unique logo design will stem organically from whatever makes your company unique.</p>","question":"How should a logo express your brand?"},{"answer":"<p>You don't. Logos should be vectorized, which means that you can size them to match your needs. Special software is required to create vectorized logos, even if you have great design skills to create a logo you love. Simply clicking WordArt in Word and typing some text, or coming up with a design in Microsoft Paint won't create a logo that will serve the interests of your business. More importantly, this isn't something that you should do yourself. It's incredibly difficult and expensive to re-brand later and ultimately, spending a few hundred dollars now on a professionally created logo design will save you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few years.</p>","question":"How do you create a logo in Microsoft Word or Paint?"},{"answer":"<p>Adobe illustrator is commonly used for logo design. Illustrator is a vector graphics editor tool. As we wrote above, you always want a vectorized version of your logo so that you can properly size it for small business cards or large billboards. That's why software like Adobe Photoshop are not proper tools for designing logos.</p>","question":"Which software is used to design logos?"},{"answer":"<p>Every company has a brand. This is true for your company whether you’ve made a single conscious branding decision or not. And that’s why it’s vitally important to make conscious, consistent branding choices. The decisions left unmade, and a brand left untended may hurt your business.</p><p>Your brand is your company’s public identity. Ideally, your brand should embody the best (and most essential) attributes of your company. That’s pretty unlikely to occur if you leave your branding to chance. Your brand name is just that - the name of your company or business. The logo is a graphical representation of that brand. Sometimes, the logo is just letters, like the logo for crowdspring you see above. Still, even in those cases, you'll see that there are design elements to those letters because a specific font was selected and in crowdspring's case, customized for the design.</p>","question":"What's the difference between a brand name and a logo?"},{"answer":"<p>A logo is a word, symbol, or a combination of the two. A symbol is a mark - typically a pictorial graphic. The Nike swoosh is a symbol, as is the apple in the Apple logo. But for both companies, you'll often see the name reflected in a graphical format where the letters are using a very specific font. Sometimes you'll see the name by itself, while at other times you'll see the name together with the symbol, or just the symbol.</p>","question":"What's the difference between a symbol or icon and a logo?"},{"answer":"<p>Some of the best logo designers in the world work on crowdspring. crowdspring is home to the world's best creative team.</p><p>Unlike the traditional freelancer or agency market, crowdspring is a crowdsourcing marketplace for graphic design.

When your project ends, you choose the design you like the best. It’s that easy!</p>","question":"Why use crowdspring for logo design?"},{"answer":"<p><p>Logo makers and generic templates will not leave a lasting impression on your customers and prospective customers. A logo maker works by picking random pieces from predrawn templates. At the end of the day, they will not give you a one-of-a-kind brand identity. There's nothing unique, custom or brilliant about instant logos created from templates. And it doesn't matter whether you create them yourself from templates or if an AI computer creates it for you. In the long term, generic design is bad for business. And, importantly, you won't be able to trademark a generic design. Instead, invest in your business and your brand identity by working with professional designers to create a unique, custom business logo design.</p>","question":"Why not to use a free logo maker for logo design?"},{"answer":"<p>Crowdspring guarantees your satisfaction in logo projects. There's NO fine-print. We are not happy until you are.

And while it may seem obvious to some why it’s important to invest in a well-designed logo, many entrepreneurs and small business owners don’t really understand why logos are so important.</p><p>In the simplest of terms, a logo is a graphic mark, emblem design, icon, or mark that identifies your company, organization, or you. If you run a business, your brand is more than just your <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/naming-a-business-or-product/' target='_blank'>company name</a> and logo, but a logo is an important part of a company’s brand. It’s the visual cornerstone of the brand.</p><p>The most important job of a logo is to help customers and customer prospects identify your company. That’s why the best logos are simple and memorable. Just think about how many logos you are able to recognize in your everyday life! Those logos serve as a reminder that Nike was the brand that made your shoes, or that Apple is the reason why you’re reading this on a Macbook.</p><p>Another important job of a logo is to draw attention to your organization and its products and/or services. Logos don’t only identify what your company does or stands for, but they also catch people’s eyes. People remember great logos! Again, it’s all about association. If people associate a specific symbol or font with your brand, then they will instantly recognize it wherever they are. It's one reason why businesses regularly use their logos on social networks and in social media.</p><p>One of the best parts of a logo, assuming you’re not using generic templates or a free logo site, is that it can only be associated with your business. It doesn’t matter if a different company is similar to yours, what matters is that your logos are different. Your logo must be your own. You have an opportunity to make a unique first impression and you can only do that with a custom logo. Often, a logo is one of the first defense barriers against competition. Besides your company’s name, it’s the first difference customers and prospects will notice. That’s why it’s important to avoid generic and cliche logos.</p>","question":"Why have a logo?"},{"answer":"<p>There are a number of important characteristics of a good logo design. A logo should be simple, memorable, timeless and unique. You want people to remember your brand and the logo is often the first connection your company will have with prospective customers.</p>","question":"What makes a good logo design?"},{"answer":"<p>A logo's flexibility is extremely important. There are so many mediums in which your logo will be employed: digital, print, physical products... it's important that your logo looks great when used in each.</p><p>If your company uses a logo that solely relies on color, your logo will lose it’s effect when it’s in black and white. Similarly, if your company intends to only use your logo in a specific way (such as on a web design, signage, shirts, letterhead, stationery, custom t-shirts, decals, or business cards), then size may not matter much. But if you’re like most companies, you’ll need a flexible logo that can be placed on multiple products, presentations, graphics, and websites. Versatility is important because it helps you reproduce your logo in a wide variety of ways.</p><p>The most successful logos are flexible enough that they don’t get lost when changing sizes, backgrounds, or mediums.</p>","question":"Should a logo be flexible?"},{"answer":"<p>The distinction between an overly simplistic design and a minimalist design is an important one. Overly simplistic, generic designs should be avoided, as they tend toward being overused, overdone, and not at all memorable. Minimalist designs, on the other hand, are popular for good reason. They are eye-catching, memorable, and timeless, but still function as creative pieces.</p><p>The minimalism trend grounds most of the other current trends, which are increasingly focused on sleek, tight designs. Ornate, overworked design has been replaced with cleaner, modern concepts that retain simplicity without forgoing originality.</p><p>One reason for minimal design’s broad-based appeal? Any business can incorporate a minimal look into their existing design scheme! If you find that your existing brand is tired and out of touch, maybe it’s time to take a look at what other businesses are doing with minimalist design on crowdspring.</p>","question":"Should a logo be simple?"},{"answer":"<p>The most memorable logos - like Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola and Target - have key characteristics in common with each other. These logos are all clean, memorable, and foster positive brand associations for their customers. Consumers are more likely to associate positive attributes to logos that incorporate memorable design elements, and find brands with these characteristics in their logos to be attractive, trustworthy, and respectable. Those are qualities worth remembering!</p>","question":"Should a logo be memorable?"},{"answer":"<p>A brand’s logo is its principal design element, acting as a visual representation of the company and its values. There are plenty of things that go into a well-designed logo, but one of the most important of these is color. It may seem like an artistic decision, but the primary color you choose for your logo actually has a serious psychological impact on how people perceive it.</p><p>In a widely-cited study called “The Impact of Color on Marketing,” research found that people make a subconscious judgment about products within the first 90 seconds of seeing it. Consumers place color above other factors such as sound, smell and texture. Almost 85% of consumers cite color as the main reason they buy a certain product, and 80% of people believe color increases brand recognition.</p><p>Even if they’re not consciously thinking about it, people associate color with different things and feelings. Making sure your brand effectively capitalizes on positive color association will make the difference in how impactful your logo is.</p>","question":"Are logo colors important?"},{"answer":"<p>A great logo walks the line between timelessness and trendiness: designing a logo that is both can be a challenge. A logo that’s unique, attractive, and adeptly communicates your brand values requires an understanding of the current design trends and the skill to use them to your best advantage.</p><p>Finding a designer who can assess the personality of your brand and convey it in a timeless logo isn't out of reach. Here at crowdspring, we have hundreds of thousands of designers equipped with the knowledge of current design trends, and the ability to incorporate them into a logo that is modern, relevant, but still timeless.</p>","question":"Should a logo be timeless?"},{"answer":"<p>Yes. A unique logo design can be the difference between blending in and standing out from the competition. Generic logos have become extremely problematic. That's why in the long run, a free logo will end up costing you much more in brand value and confusion than paying a few hundred dollars for a professional designed one.</p><p>The epidemic of too-similar fonts, glyphs, and swishy people leaves a weak first impression on customers and is unmemorable. Even though some of these generic logos may help a person identify the industry itself, generic logos also detract from the originality and story of your specific company. Generic logos even break the core elements of good logo design: memorable and unique, making them poor choices for any company. Imagine if you're a photographer looking for a photography logo for your business and you end up with a design that looks like a thousand other photographer logos. That will make it impossible for you to stand out.</p><p>The inspiration for a logo can come from a number of places: nature, experiences, other logos, the list is never ending. But the best, most original logos draw inspiration from what the company does or values. Whatever makes your company unique and stand out from competitors will also make your logo unique.</p>","question":"Should a logo design be unique?"},{"answer":"<p>Good logos are not just about creative illustrations and drawings! Many companies use typography in their logos either instead of or in addition to images and symbols.</p><p>When incorporating words or phrases, logos often play with the font, style, size, and even letter spacing. Some logos include the company’s full name, while some just include an initial. Some don’t include any letters or words at all, but traditionally use a specific text style for those elements. Either way, typography including the choice of serif or sans serif fonts and typefaces, is essential to making the words behind your company synergize with the other graphic elements of the logo. Can it be read at small sizes? Is the letterspacing/word spacing well adjusted? Typography is a craft in itself - it's the first voice of stating who you are.</p>","question":"How important is typography in the design of a great logo?"},{"answer":"<p>Is your logo going to be printed on paper? Business cards? Billboards? Physical products? Today, there are a lot of mediums and sizes and our logos have to perform well across all mediums. Therefore it’s important to consider where and how your logo will be displayed so that you can specify colors and file formats. At crowdspring, we have you covered by making sure you receive vectorized logo designs, which are useful in any medium.</p><p>You should always request vector based graphics. It's often tempting to ask for complex illustrations in a logo. However, unless you plan on never using your logo outside of an on-screen/online application, a JPG or PSD isn't going to cut it. A properly drawn vector design in an SVG, EPS or compatible format will provide you with the ultimate flexibility.</p>","question":"Why do you need vector files for your logo?"},{"answer":"<p>Instead of copying or mimicking famous logos, the best designers look to create a unique brand when creating a business logo or a logo for another type of organization. The breakthrough designs they create often come from the deeper meanings they find within the company, which is the reason why so many companies have logo origin stories or hidden meanings.</p><p>The secret is to uncover that deeper or hidden meaning before designing the logo. A unique logo design will stem organically from whatever makes your company unique.</p>","question":"How should a logo express your brand?"},{"answer":"<p>You don't. Logos should be vectorized, which means that you can size them to match your needs. Special software is required to create vectorized logos, even if you have great design skills to create a logo you love. Simply clicking WordArt in Word and typing some text, or coming up with a design in Microsoft Paint won't create a logo that will serve the interests of your business. More importantly, this isn't something that you should do yourself. It's incredibly difficult and expensive to re-brand later and ultimately, spending a few hundred dollars now on a professionally created logo design will save you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few years.</p>","question":"How do you create a logo in Microsoft Word or Paint?"},{"answer":"<p>Adobe illustrator is commonly used for logo design. Illustrator is a vector graphics editor tool. As we wrote above, you always want a vectorized version of your logo so that you can properly size it for small business cards or large billboards. That's why software like Adobe Photoshop are not proper tools for designing logos.</p>","question":"Which software is used to design logos?"},{"answer":"<p>Every company has a brand. This is true for your company whether you’ve made a single conscious branding decision or not. And that’s why it’s vitally important to make conscious, consistent branding choices. The decisions left unmade, and a brand left untended may hurt your business.</p><p>Your brand is your company’s public identity. Ideally, your brand should embody the best (and most essential) attributes of your company. That’s pretty unlikely to occur if you leave your branding to chance. Your brand name is just that - the name of your company or business. The logo is a graphical representation of that brand. Sometimes, the logo is just letters, like the logo for crowdspring you see above. Still, even in those cases, you'll see that there are design elements to those letters because a specific font was selected and in crowdspring's case, customized for the design.</p>","question":"What's the difference between a brand name and a logo?"},{"answer":"<p>A logo is a word, symbol, or a combination of the two. A symbol is a mark - typically a pictorial graphic. The Nike swoosh is a symbol, as is the apple in the Apple logo. But for both companies, you'll often see the name reflected in a graphical format where the letters are using a very specific font. Sometimes you'll see the name by itself, while at other times you'll see the name together with the symbol, or just the symbol.</p>","question":"What's the difference between a symbol or icon and a logo?"},{"answer":"<p>Some of the best logo designers in the world work on crowdspring. crowdspring is home to the world's best creative team.</p><p>Unlike the traditional freelancer or agency market, crowdspring is a crowdsourcing marketplace for graphic design. It's like a logo design contest - on crowdspring, thousands of designers from over 195 countries around the world compete for your business to create an online logo design you'll love. You will get choice for your logo design that you will not get anywhere else. In fact, we guarantee your satisfaction 100% – no questions asked.</p><p>Our unique model and design process addresses many of the concerns encountered when pricing the design of logos. We take a lot of the work and stress out of the equation for you: you won't need to get quotes in advance for the work, or interview designer after designer.</p><p>Your set the price for your project, and  designers from around the world will post their designs to your project for you to review. When your project ends, you choose the design you like the best. It’s that easy!</p>","question":"Why use crowdspring for logo design?"},{"answer":"<p><p>Logo makers and generic templates will not leave a lasting impression on your customers and prospective customers. A logo maker works by picking random pieces from predrawn templates. At the end of the day, they will not give you a one-of-a-kind brand identity. There's nothing unique, custom or brilliant about instant logos created from templates. And it doesn't matter whether you create them yourself from templates or if an AI computer creates it for you. In the long term, generic design is bad for business. And, importantly, you won't be able to trademark a generic design. Instead, invest in your business and your brand identity by working with professional designers to create a unique, custom business logo design.</p>","question":"Why not to use a free logo maker for logo design?"},{"answer":"<p>Crowdspring guarantees your satisfaction in logo projects. There's NO fine-print. We are not happy until you are. People are so thrilled with the designs they receive on crowdspring that we are proud to stand behind the work and make you an unconditional promise.</p>","question":"Why does crowdspring offer a 100% money-back guarantee?"}]},"block_type":"faq"},{"data":{"image":{"alt":"","url":""},"title":"Great resources to help you start or grow your business...","content_html":"<p>Whether you're starting a new business or looking to grow an existing business, we've pulled together some of our best resources to help you.<p>If you are are ready to become your own boss and wonder <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/how-to-start-a-business/' target='_blank'>how to start a business</a> in 2019, we have a complete guide that will help you to get started quickly.</p><p>If you are a respected expert in a particular field and want to know <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/how-to-start-a-consulting-business/' target='_blank'>how to start a consulting business</a>, we have you covered too.</p><p>If you already have a specific industry in mind, we can help.

important?","description_html":"<p>A brand is a name, term, design, or symbol that differentiates a business, organization, firm, product or services from its rivals, in the eyes of the customer.</p><p>A strong brand name communicates what your company does, how it does it, and at the same time, establishes trust and credibility with your prospects and customers. Strong business names are important for every type of entity, including corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLC), LLP, PLC, joint ventures, and others.</p><p>Business names can be real words, made-up words, or combinations of words. For example, Hospira, a name selected by the company's employees, was derived from the words hospital, spirit, inspire, and the Latin word spero, which means hope. Bosch, a German diversified technology-based corporation, was named after its founder, Robert Bosch.</p><p>Some famous companies started operating under different names but later changed those names. For example, Google was initially called BackRub. Pepsi-Cola was initially called Brad's Drink. Sony was initially known as Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo. BP, formerly British Petroleum, was shortened as part of a rebranding effort in 2000.</p><p>Some companies choose to operate under a trade name, or trading name, which is a pseudonym frequently used by companies to operate under a name different from their registered legal name.</p><p>If you have an existing name that no longer fits your brand, you can learn more about the <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/rename-business/' target='_blank'>why and how to rename your business</a>, and review the <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/10-tips-for-startups-and-small-businesses-on-naming-your-company/' target='_blank'>10 tips for naming your startup or small business</a> on our award-winning business marketing blog.</p>"},{"image":"","title":"Should you use a business name generator?","description_html":"<p>Some services claim they can help you create business names and check domain availability instantly by using computers instead of real people.</p><p>The truth is that computers can help generate random, unique names, but how many of those names will actually be a foundation for a strong brand?</p><p>There's a reason the world's best marketers, agencies, and Brands rely on real people to name companies and not on algorithms. In fact, none of the most successful companies in the United States or anywhere else in the world were named by a machine.</p><p>A name generator, whether it's a free business name generator or one for which you pay, will just spit out lots of random words, not actual brands. Business name generators are unimaginative and uninspired.</p><p>So whether you're a first-time entrepreneur seeking strong company name ideas or have an existing business considering a rebrand, avoid algorithmic business name generators and get the perfect name for your business from real people, not machines.</p><p>And if you get your new catchy business name from crowdspring, you'll get not just  terrific new name ideas, but you'll also get suggestions for the perfect domain name that matches the name of the business.</p>"}]},"block_type":"benefits"},{"data":{"steps":[{"faqs":[{"answer":"<p>Naming projects run for 7 days, but you can shorten them to as little as 1 day if you're in a hurry.

At times, it feels like every name in the dictionary is already taken. And just when you think you have found the perfect name, you realize that you can’t get the matching domain name.</p><p>Naming consultants want to charge you thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to help name your company or product. Few business owners can afford such fees.

When your project ends, you choose the name you like the best. It’s that simple!</p>","question":"Why use crowdspring to name a new business or product?"},{"answer":"<p>Here are 10 things to consider when determining a good business name or product name:</p><p><b>1. Think about what you want your company name to convey.</b> Service oriented businesses should consider whether it will be easy for their prospective customers to recognize what services the business provides, based on the name of the company (example: Friendly Dog Walkers or Bright Accounting). Businesses located in rural areas and serving rural communities may want to project a smaller, hometown feel with their name. However, businesses planning to focus on bigger markets or bigger customers might want to project a larger, more corporate image with their name.</p><p><b>2. Brainstorm name possibilities.</b> Think about words that describe your industry or the products/services you offer. Think about words that describe your competitors and words that describe the differences between your products and services and those of your competitors. Also, consider words that describe the benefits of using your products or services. Finally, think about words and phrases that evoke the feelings you want your customers to feel when they see your company name.</p><p><b>3. Keep the name short, simple, and easy to write and remember.</b> Obscure business names are often difficult to write and even more difficult to remember. This is a problem because for most startups and small businesses, word-of-mouth advertising is the most successful form of marketing. If your customers can’t remember your name or can’t spell it for others, it will make it difficult for them to help promote your business. While it might be tempting, avoid using a K in place of a Q or a Ph in place of an F when coming up with your company name. Such letter substitutions make spelling the name very difficult. Also, don’t forget to consider the acronym of your company name (an acronym is composed of the first letter of each word in a phrase). You might not use an acronym, but your customers might refer to your business by an acronym. A name such as Apple Support Services can result in an unfavorable acronym – ASS.</p><p><b>4. Avoid names that are too narrow or too literal.</b> Think about how your company may evolve over time and make sure that the company name can evolve with the business. For example, if you name your company iPhone Accessories and later expand to sell accessories for other products, your original name will be too narrow and restrictive.</p>","question":"What should you consider when determining a business name or product name?"},{"answer":"<p>In addition to the 4 tips we offered above, here are 6 more tips.</p><p><b>5. Avoid decision by committee.</b> You’ll find yourself trying to find consensus – which can lead to a very plain name. If you must involve others, pick a small group of people who understand you and your business (and pick a mix of right-brain types and left-brain types so that you can have some variety.</p><p><b>6. Avoid plain words.</b> Plain words make it very difficult to differentiate your company from your competitors. For example, there were hundreds of thousands of logo design businesses around the world when we started thinking about crowdspring. We knew that we would be expanding to many different industries (graphic design, web design, industrial design, writing, and many more) and so we didn’t want to name our business Great Logo Design or ManyDesigners – it would have been descriptive, but not memorable and certainly not sufficiently unique.</p><p><b>7. Be careful with geographic names.</b> Some people use their city, state or region as part of their company name. If you plan only to work in your city, then this might serve you well. But a geographic name could hinder you later.</p><p><b>8. Avoid obscure words.</b> Obscure words or references might be difficult to spell or pronounce. Be especially sensitive if you're trying to reach a mass audience (such as on the Internet). Obscure or invented names can work – Xerox is a great example – but this often requires a huge marketing budget and tremendous effort.</p><p><b>9. Avoid trends and fads.</b> You’ll want your company’s name to evolve as trends evolve, so be careful to identify the trends and to avoid following them. For example, in the late 1990’s, it was trendy to use a .com after your company name if your company was an Internet business. After the Internet bubble burst, the .com became synonymous with having no business model and those companies who survived very quickly dropped .com from their names.</p><p><b>10. Consider the domain.</b> Look for a  name that is also available for registration as a domain (ideally, as a .com domain). You should understand that .com domains are very popular and you’ll struggle to find available domains that match your company name. Many people obsess during this process. That's why name suggestions on crowdspring include a matching domain name!</p>","question":"What else should you consider when determining a business or product name?"},{"answer":"<p>Creatives on crowdspring suggest not only names, but also URLs to accompany those names!</p><p>Now it's not always possible to find an identical URL when you have a name you love. But that's a smaller problem today than it used to be.</p><p>The number of people who type in URLs is shrinking every day. Small business owners still seem to be obsessing over getting the pure URL as MyCompanyName.com, but the larger organizations have adapted. The URL is becoming much less important. Nowadays people are putting the name into Google to find sites. The sad fact is that the vast majority of names we consider are ‘camped’ by squatters hoping to make a quick buck. If you don’t have deep pockets or a convincing story to share you’re going to get taken to the cleaners.</p><p>Google is a great tool for getting around this issue—if you’ve got a strong brand and you’re getting links from people you’ll end up as the number one response for your name even if it isn’t the pure dotcom domain.</p>","question":"Finding a great name today also requires being able to register a URL for that name. How much of a challenge does this present and how can you overcome the challenge?"},{"answer":"<p>Yes. Keep the business name short and make it easy to pronounce and spell. Some new businesses make the mistake of picking what sounds like a cool name - but one that is very difficult for people to pronounce or spell. If people can't pronounce or spell your business name, they'll have difficulty recommending your business to their friends and colleagues.</p>","question":"Is the length of a business name important?"},{"answer":"<p>When you pick your business name, you should think a bit about how the name will translate into a visual identity. It's premature to start picturing your logo design when you name the company, but most people associate words with images, so it's important for you to consider this as you pick your company name. Make sure that the images your business name conjures up in prospective customers are positive. Once you have a strong name, you'll want to think about ways to strengthen the name with a great <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/logo-design/' target='_blank'>logo design.</a></p>","question":"How does the business name relate to the company logo?"},{"answer":"<p>The major search engines, like Google, Bing, and Yahoo, all index your company name. That means it's really important to think carefully before coming up with a name for your business. Are you facing heavy competition from others in your industry? Is your name confusing for the industry it belongs to? Is the name so generic that people cannot find it?</p><p>Since you'll be competing with other businesses in your industry for search results, you'll have to get pretty crafty. Make sure that the name you choose for your company gives you an advantage and doesn't act as a hindrance to how readily searchable you are on the web. </p>","question":"How important is your company name for search engines?"},{"answer":"<p>Big companies run focus group tests to ask potential customers how they feel about a possible business name or product name. You can do something very similar by running prospective names by your friends, family, or your customers or potential customers. You also can ask your vendors or suppliers. These informal focus groups might suggest some improvements or might offer some feedback on why certain names are better than other company names.</p>","question":"How can you test the company name?"},{"answer":"<p>We have one of the most talented communities of creatives on the planet. Over the past decade, our team has helped tens of thousands of small business owners, entrepreneurs, agencies, and non-profits. The vast majority of our clients find a great name they love.

Strong business names are important for every type of entity, including corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLC), LLP, PLC, joint ventures, and others.</p><p>Business names can be real words, made-up words, or combinations of words. For example, Hospira, a name selected by the company's employees, was derived from the words hospital, spirit, inspire, and the Latin word spero, which means hope. Bosch, a German diversified technology-based corporation, was named after its founder, Robert Bosch.</p><p>Some famous companies started operating under different names but later changed those names. For example, Google was initially called BackRub. Pepsi-Cola was initially called Brad's Drink. Sony was initially known as Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo. BP, formerly British Petroleum, was shortened as part of a rebranding effort in 2000.</p><p>Some companies choose to operate under a trade name, or trading name, which is a pseudonym frequently used by companies to operate under a name different from their registered legal name.</p><p>If you have an existing name that no longer fits your brand, you can learn more about the <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/rename-business/' target='_blank'>why and how to rename your business</a>, and review the <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/10-tips-for-startups-and-small-businesses-on-naming-your-company/' target='_blank'>10 tips for naming your startup or small business</a> on our award-winning business marketing blog.</p>"},{"image":"","title":"Should you use a business name generator?","description_html":"<p>Some services claim they can help you create business names and check domain availability instantly by using computers instead of real people.</p><p>The truth is that computers can help generate random, unique names, but how many of those names will actually be a foundation for a strong brand?</p><p>There's a reason the world's best marketers, agencies, and Brands rely on real people to name companies and not on algorithms.

When your project ends, you choose the name you like the best. It’s that simple!</p>","question":"Why use crowdspring to name a new business or product?"},{"answer":"<p>Here are 10 things to consider when determining a good business name or product name:</p><p><b>1. Think about what you want your company name to convey.</b> Service oriented businesses should consider whether it will be easy for their prospective customers to recognize what services the business provides, based on the name of the company (example: Friendly Dog Walkers or Bright Accounting). Businesses located in rural areas and serving rural communities may want to project a smaller, hometown feel with their name. However, businesses planning to focus on bigger markets or bigger customers might want to project a larger, more corporate image with their name.</p><p><b>2. Brainstorm name possibilities.</b> Think about words that describe your industry or the products/services you offer. Think about words that describe your competitors and words that describe the differences between your products and services and those of your competitors. Also, consider words that describe the benefits of using your products or services. Finally, think about words and phrases that evoke the feelings you want your customers to feel when they see your company name.</p><p><b>3. Keep the name short, simple, and easy to write and remember.</b> Obscure business names are often difficult to write and even more difficult to remember. This is a problem because for most startups and small businesses, word-of-mouth advertising is the most successful form of marketing. If your customers can’t remember your name or can’t spell it for others, it will make it difficult for them to help promote your business. While it might be tempting, avoid using a K in place of a Q or a Ph in place of an F when coming up with your company name. Such letter substitutions make spelling the name very difficult. Also, don’t forget to consider the acronym of your company name (an acronym is composed of the first letter of each word in a phrase). You might not use an acronym, but your customers might refer to your business by an acronym. A name such as Apple Support Services can result in an unfavorable acronym – ASS.</p><p><b>4. Avoid names that are too narrow or too literal.</b> Think about how your company may evolve over time and make sure that the company name can evolve with the business. For example, if you name your company iPhone Accessories and later expand to sell accessories for other products, your original name will be too narrow and restrictive.</p>","question":"What should you consider when determining a business name or product name?"},{"answer":"<p>In addition to the 4 tips we offered above, here are 6 more tips.</p><p><b>5. Avoid decision by committee.</b> You’ll find yourself trying to find consensus – which can lead to a very plain name. If you must involve others, pick a small group of people who understand you and your business (and pick a mix of right-brain types and left-brain types so that you can have some variety.</p><p><b>6. Avoid plain words.</b> Plain words make it very difficult to differentiate your company from your competitors. For example, there were hundreds of thousands of logo design businesses around the world when we started thinking about crowdspring. We knew that we would be expanding to many different industries (graphic design, web design, industrial design, writing, and many more) and so we didn’t want to name our business Great Logo Design or ManyDesigners – it would have been descriptive, but not memorable and certainly not sufficiently unique.</p><p><b>7. Be careful with geographic names.</b> Some people use their city, state or region as part of their company name. If you plan only to work in your city, then this might serve you well. But a geographic name could hinder you later.</p><p><b>8. Avoid obscure words.</b> Obscure words or references might be difficult to spell or pronounce. Be especially sensitive if you're trying to reach a mass audience (such as on the Internet). Obscure or invented names can work – Xerox is a great example – but this often requires a huge marketing budget and tremendous effort.</p><p><b>9. Avoid trends and fads.</b> You’ll want your company’s name to evolve as trends evolve, so be careful to identify the trends and to avoid following them. For example, in the late 1990’s, it was trendy to use a .com after your company name if your company was an Internet business. After the Internet bubble burst, the .com became synonymous with having no business model and those companies who survived very quickly dropped .com from their names.</p><p><b>10. Consider the domain.</b> Look for a  name that is also available for registration as a domain (ideally, as a .com domain). You should understand that .com domains are very popular and you’ll struggle to find available domains that match your company name. Many people obsess during this process. That's why name suggestions on crowdspring include a matching domain name!</p>","question":"What else should you consider when determining a business or product name?"},{"answer":"<p>Creatives on crowdspring suggest not only names, but also URLs to accompany those names!</p><p>Now it's not always possible to find an identical URL when you have a name you love. But that's a smaller problem today than it used to be.</p><p>The number of people who type in URLs is shrinking every day. Small business owners still seem to be obsessing over getting the pure URL as MyCompanyName.com, but the larger organizations have adapted. The URL is becoming much less important. Nowadays people are putting the name into Google to find sites. The sad fact is that the vast majority of names we consider are ‘camped’ by squatters hoping to make a quick buck. If you don’t have deep pockets or a convincing story to share you’re going to get taken to the cleaners.</p><p>Google is a great tool for getting around this issue—if you’ve got a strong brand and you’re getting links from people you’ll end up as the number one response for your name even if it isn’t the pure dotcom domain.</p>","question":"Finding a great name today also requires being able to register a URL for that name. How much of a challenge does this present and how can you overcome the challenge?"},{"answer":"<p>Yes. Keep the business name short and make it easy to pronounce and spell. Some new businesses make the mistake of picking what sounds like a cool name - but one that is very difficult for people to pronounce or spell. If people can't pronounce or spell your business name, they'll have difficulty recommending your business to their friends and colleagues.</p>","question":"Is the length of a business name important?"},{"answer":"<p>When you pick your business name, you should think a bit about how the name will translate into a visual identity. It's premature to start picturing your logo design when you name the company, but most people associate words with images, so it's important for you to consider this as you pick your company name. Make sure that the images your business name conjures up in prospective customers are positive. Once you have a strong name, you'll want to think about ways to strengthen the name with a great <a href='https://www.crowdspring.com/logo-design/' target='_blank'>logo design.</a></p>","question":"How does the business name relate to the company logo?"},{"answer":"<p>The major search engines, like Google, Bing, and Yahoo, all index your company name. That means it's really important to think carefully before coming up with a name for your business. Are you facing heavy competition from others in your industry? Is your name confusing for the industry it belongs to? Is the name so generic that people cannot find it?</p><p>Since you'll be competing with other businesses in your industry for search results, you'll have to get pretty crafty. Make sure that the name you choose for your company gives you an advantage and doesn't act as a hindrance to how readily searchable you are on the web. </p>","question":"How important is your company name for search engines?"},{"answer":"<p>Big companies run focus group tests to ask potential customers how they feel about a possible business name or product name. You can do something very similar by running prospective names by your friends, family, or your customers or potential customers. You also can ask your vendors or suppliers. These informal focus groups might suggest some improvements or might offer some feedback on why certain names are better than other company names.</p>","question":"How can you test the company name?"},{"answer":"<p>We have one of the most talented communities of creatives on the planet. Over the past decade, our team has helped tens of thousands of small business owners, entrepreneurs, agencies, and non-profits. The vast majority of our clients find a great name they love.
