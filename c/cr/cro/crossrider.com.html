This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use available at www.crossrider.com.<br>
      <br>
      <center><strong>Consent and Modification</strong></center><br>
      <br>
      By using this Site, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy and to Crossrider's processing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein.

      <br>
      <center><strong>Introduction</strong></center><br>
      <br>
      We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>") you share with us. <br>
      <br>
      “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information. <br>
      Any information, video, image, data, text, documents, or other content posted at your direction onto a public area of the Site becomes publicly published content and will be available to all users of the Site even if such content contains Personal Information. Please note that if you publish your contact information, you may receive unsolicited messages from users and visitors to the Site. We encourage you to publish only information you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.<br>
      Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to information available on our Site.

      <br>
      Certain products and services given through the Site may require a fee. In order to use such services you will be required to pay an applicable fee as published on the Site. We may use a third party payment processing company in order to collect such fee and you will be required to provide such third party certain personally identifiable information such as your name, billing address and credit card information. Such third party's use of such information will be governed by its privacy policy provided, however, that we use reasonable commercial efforts to limit such third party's from using your information for any other purpose.<br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <center><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></center><br>
      <br>
      Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. <br>
      <br>
      You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.  <br>
