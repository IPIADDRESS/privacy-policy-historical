                    <p>CrownPeak Technology ("CrownPeak" or "We") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. &nbsp;CrownPeak has created this privacy policy ("Policy") in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By accessing the CrownPeak website at <a href="http://www.crownpeak.com">www.crownpeak.com</a>, including all related pages ("Site"), including the utilization of any subscription based features or services offered by CrownPeak through the Site or any sites or pages operated or provided by CrownPeak to its customers or subscribers, whether or not linked to the Site (collectively, the "Service"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Policy covers CrownPeak's collection and use of personal information that CrownPeak gathers when you are on the Site and when you use the Service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that CrownPeak does not own or control, or to individuals that CrownPeak does not employ or manage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For avoidance of doubt, this Policy does not apply to any third party information (a) gathered by CrownPeak's subscribers (i.e., information about customers of CrownPeak subscribers) and submitted by them to the Service for use in connection with their activities, or (b) submitted by customers of CrownPeak’s subscribers directly to the Service ("Customer Data"). CrownPeak will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in this Policy, the agreement between CrownPeak and its subscriber, or as may be required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer Data may at times be viewed or accessed by CrownPeak for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or for investigating a suspected violation of the CrownPeak’s agreement with its subscriber, or as may be required by law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. What Personal Information About Customers Does CrownPeak Collect?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Information You or Your Customers Provide to Us</span>: &nbsp;CrownPeak collects identifying information about you when you use the Service, when you visit the Site (including, without limitation, any crownpeak.com web pages or landing pages), and when you enter promotions or contests. We also collect identifying Customer Data from you as you use the Service, or directly from your customers as they input Customer Data into sites and pages operated, maintained or published by us for you as part of the Service. &nbsp;For example, we require our subscribers who register to use the Service to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Service. &nbsp;When you initially express interest obtaining additional information about the Service, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask for additional types personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues or marketing spend. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords. &nbsp;The nature of Customer Data we collect depends on the activities undertaken in your own business and the nature of the information you require your customers to enter into your sites and pages operated, maintained or published by us. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
We may use non-personal information in the manner described below under “Automatic Information”. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for the Service. Such billing information is not used by CrownPeak for marketing or promotional purposes. CrownPeak may use a third-party intermediary to manage billing and payment processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of billing and payment processing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are a registered user of CrownPeak's subscription-based Service, please note that some information about you, and your Customer Data, may remain in our records after the end of your trial or subscription.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Information</span>: &nbsp;We receive and store certain types of information (including Customer Data) whenever you (or in certain cases, your customers) interact with us via the Site or in connection with your use of the Service. CrownPeak automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs including your IP address, CrownPeak cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interactions with other site registrants. CrownPeak uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site and the Service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and use of components of the Service. We may use this information to provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Service). This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data also enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Service so we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Site and Service. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use areas of our Site and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also collect and use information for internal purposes. For example, if you are a registered user of the CrownPeak's subscription-based Service, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of our Client Service Agreement that you or someone on your account may have committed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While CrownPeak will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">E-mail Communications</span>: &nbsp;We may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from CrownPeak if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with information regarding CrownPeak or our partners including promotions and events. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@crownpeak.com">support@crownpeak.com</a> or by following an “unsubscribe” link in the email itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Information From Other Sources</span>: &nbsp;For purposes such as improving personalization of our Service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. What about Cookies?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. CrownPeak employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. The cookies placed by the CrownPeak server are readable only by CrownPeak, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of CrownPeak's most attractive features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Will CrownPeak Share Any of the Information it Receives?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Information about our customers and Customer Data collected on behalf of our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell any personal information to anyone. We share personal information (yours and as included in Customer Data) only with entities that are controlled or controlled by or under common control of CrownPeak, and as described below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Affiliated Business We Do Not Control</span>: &nbsp;We are affiliated or partnered with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses operate within the Service or through the Site. &nbsp;In other situations, CrownPeak markets or sells products or services jointly with affiliated businesses. We will plainly disclose any program where we intend to share your information with an affiliated business, and give you the opportunity to decline to supply customer information or to opt out of such sharing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Agents</span>: &nbsp;We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
