<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>CrownPeak Technology (“CrownPeak”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following outlines our information gathering and dissemination practices; our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through this website www.crownpeak.com and other websites owned by CrownPeak accessible by our customers’ end users or by the general public. These websites are collectively referred to in this privacy statement as “our website”, “this website” or their respective plurals. Our use of information collected through our website shall be limited to the purposes outlined in the CrownPeak Services Agreement executed between CrownPeak and your company or, in the case of general public access, by the principles outlined in this privacy statement. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy statement and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this statement easy to find, we make it available on our corporate website (http://www.crownpeak.com/privacy) and at every point where personal information may be requested.</p>
<p>To show our commitment to privacy, we have entered into three voluntary data privacy programs: the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank"><strong>US-EU Safe Harbor</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank"><strong>U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.truste.org/"><strong>TRUSTe</strong></a>. Our involvement and participation in these programs is described below.</p>
<h3>Safe Harbor</h3>
<p>We follow privacy principles with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the twenty-eight member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and from Switzerland to the United States.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States (the “U.S.-EU Safe Harbor"). The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47).</p>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under Swiss law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States (the “U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor”).</p>
<p>CrownPeak complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. CrownPeak has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view CrownPeak’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.</p>
<h3>TRUSTe Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor Frameworks, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Frameworks. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should first contact <a href="mailto:privacy@crownpeak.com"><strong>privacy@crownpeak.com</strong></a>. If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank"><strong>clicking here</strong></a><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">,</span> or by fax at 415-520-3420 or mail to TRUSTe Safe Harbor Compliance Dept., <a href="http://www.truste.com/about-TRUSTe/contact-us" target="_blank"><strong>click for mailing address</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you are faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about TRUSTe or the operation of TRUSTe's dispute resolution process, click <a href="http://www.truste.com/products-and-services/dispute-resolution-services/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> or request this information from TRUSTe at any of the addresses listed above. The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. For human resources data we have agreed to cooperate with Data Protection Authorities.</p>
<h3>TRUSTe Privacy Seal</h3>
<p>In addition, CrownPeak has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/TRUSTed-cloud/" target="_blank"><strong>TRUSTe Cloud Privacy program requirements</strong></a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

<h3>Information Related to Data Collected on the CrownPeak CMS Platform</h3>
<p>CrownPeak collects personal information to identify individuals and manage their access to the CMS Platform.</p>
<p>CrownPeak will retain personal information we collect on the CMS Platform for as long as needed to provide services to our customers and/or as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct,amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the CrownPeak’s Client (the data controller). If the Client request CrownPeak to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p>
<h3>External Links</h3>
<p>Our websites contains links to third party sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third party sites. We are not responsible for information given to us that you authorize for transfer to third party sites. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span></p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>CrownPeak uses secure sockets layer (SSL) for securing communications and transactions across the Internet . &nbsp;When you enter sensitive information (such as cloud login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology. The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications between the browser and our web server. Data transmitted over an SSL connection cannot be tampered with or forged without the two parties (you and CrownPeak) becoming immediately aware of the tampering. A key or padlock icon in the browser window identifies the security mode of most popular browsers. When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key is broken or the padlock is open. Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is now in “secure” mode. SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption. CrownPeak uses certificates from well known providers of digital trust services that enable businesses and consumers to engage in commerce and communications with confidence.</p>
<p>For data collected by websites hosted by CrownPeak on behalf of its customers, CrownPeak ensures that all applicable Safe Harbor Principles are applied to the data for as long as it is hosted by CrownPeak and under CrownPeak’s control.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. For that reason, no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18.</p>
<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by CrownPeak Technology and our partners (e.g. marketing partners), affiliates, or analytics or service providers&nbsp; (e.g. marketing automation, analytics, CRM). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use cookies&nbsp;for web analytics and marketing automation, to track user behavior across our site, deliver personalized content, grant access to specific content, and to streamline the process for resource downloads<em>. </em>Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.</p>
