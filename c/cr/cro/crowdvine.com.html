<h1>CrowdVine Privacy Policy</h1>
<br>
<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from every page on our networks.</p>

<h3>The Information We Collect:</h3>

<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the CrowdVine website or social networks running on the CrowdVine service. Primarily we collect information from users in order to create profiles and engage in discussion. The information we collect includes, but is not limited to: name, location, personal URLs, blogs, and contacts.</p>

<h3>The Way We Use Information:</h3>

<p>We use the information you provide about yourself to create profiles for other people to find out more about you. Depending on the privacy settings of the network, your profile may be visible to just other members or publicly visible to anyone visiting the network.</p>

<p>We use the information you provide about yourself to help network administrators manage their communities. Anything you provide directly to a network will also be visible to the administrator of that network. Administrators will not be able to see information you provide to other CrowdVine networks.</p>

<p>We use your email address to help people contact you. We send notifications directly to your email address. Your email address will not be visible to other members of the network unless you contact one of the members. You may control notification settings through your account settings.</p>

<p>We support many data portability standards, including RSS, OPML, FOAF, hcard+XFN, and vcard. These standards are meant to allow for programs outside of CrowdVine to access your data under the same rules as above.</p>

<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of CEOs and Z number of engineers filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>

<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without getting your opt-in approval.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

<h3>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h3>

<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by visiting your account settings page or by visiting the edit profile options on each of the networks that you are a member of. </p>

<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information through our account management tools or by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>

<h3>How To Contact Us</h3>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please call us at 1-707-953-3868 or send us an email at privacy@crowdvine.com.</p>
