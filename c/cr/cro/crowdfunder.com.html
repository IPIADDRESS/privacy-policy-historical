<p>How We Disclose Your Information</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information: &nbsp;crowdfunder.com may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the purpose of providing services to you. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of crowdfunder.com (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with business partners who assist us by performing services such as hosting, fulfillment, or data storage and security related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we’ve promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your information to carry out their specific business obligations to crowdfunder.</p>
<p>crowdfunder.com may be required to disclose personal information by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our<a href="/blog/terms-of-use"> Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of crowdfunder.com, our users or others.</p>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain crowdfunder.com services.</p>
<p>crowdfunder.com may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements or services on the crowdfunder.com site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on crowdfunder.com. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. &nbsp;Some links are to service providers that we believe offer complementary services, and in some instances we may receive a commission for referrals. However, we do not control or take any responsibility for the actions of any such service providers, including without limitation if those service providers use your personal information in any inappropriate manner. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites. We may share your personal information with unaffiliated businesses that you request to learn more information about or that you request to provide you with services.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The crowdfunder.com privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.</p>
<p>We may access certain information of yours that exists on third party sites such as Facebook.com and Linkedin.com. We will only access such information if you grant us permission to do so, such as by clicking on a link on our Site. We may use your information in any way consistent with this Privacy Policy, and we may also use your profile picture from such sites on our Site.</p>
<p>If you sign a petition on our Site, we may deliver the petition including whatever personal information you provided us in signing the petition to the designated recipient(s) of the petition.</p>
<p>Non-personal information may be collected about your usage of the Site and aggregated with data from other users (“Aggregate Data”). This Aggregate Data is anonymous. Aggregate Data is collected to build higher quality, more useful services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our users. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business partners.<br><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.13797071087174118"><br>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at www.crowdfunder.com/privacy-policy.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.13797071087174118"></strong></p>
