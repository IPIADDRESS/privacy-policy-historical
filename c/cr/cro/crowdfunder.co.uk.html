Introduction</h4>        <p><em>Welcome to <strong>Crowdfunder</strong>. This policy explains how we handle and use your personal            information and your rights in relation to that information. Under data protection law, Crowdfunder Limited            is the controller of that information and responsible for its use and protection. As we operate a platform            that allows our members to run fundraising projects and reach out to others for funding, those members may            also be separately legally responsible for the use of your information in connection with those projects.        </em></p>        <p>Crowdfunder Limited (<strong>we</strong>, <strong>our </strong>or <strong>us</strong>) is committed to            protecting and respecting your privacy. </p>        <p>This Privacy Policy explains why and how we will use the personal information that we have obtained from you            or others, with whom we share it and the rights you have in connection with the information we use. Please            read the following carefully. </p>        <p>This policy describes the way we handle and use the personal information that we obtain from all the            different interactions you may have with us as a business, including when you visit our offices, social            media pages or website currently located at www.crowdfunder.co.uk (<strong>Site</strong>) or when you            contact us or take part in any of our competitions or promotions. </p>        <p>We, Crowdfunder Limited, are the controller in relation to the processing activities described below. This            means that we decide why and how your personal information is processed. Please see the section at the end            of this policy for our contact and legal information. </p>        <p>Our members run fundraising campaigns from our Site and in doing so may collect personal information from you            if you pledge funds to their projects. Their use of that information during and after their campaign (e.g.            to keep in contact with you about progress of their project and their achievements) are uses of your            information for which those members determine, independently of us. As a result, those members will be            separate controllers of your personal information. </p>        <p>We refer to ‘project owners’, ‘backers’ and ‘pledges’ throughout this document. For more information            regarding these, please see our <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/terms-conditions" title="" target="_blank">Terms</a>. </p>        <p>This policy was last updated on the date that appears at the top of this page. </p>        <h4>2.

Transfers of your personal information outside of Europe</h4>        <p><em>Except in a limited number of cases, we do not transfer your personal information outside of Europe. Where            we do, we take measures to protect your personal information.</em></p>        <p>All the personal information collected about you by us or on our behalf may be transferred to countries            outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By way of example, this may happen where any of our group            companies are located in a country outside of the EEA or if any of our servers or those of our third party            service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not            have similar data protection laws to the UK and so they may not protect the use of your personal information            to the same extent. The non-EEA countries to which we transfer your personal information are listed in the            table in&nbsp;<a href="#disclosure">Disclosure and sharing of your personal information by us</a>.</p>        <p>If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate            security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as            outlined in this policy. These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipients of your            personal information or ensuring that the recipients are subscribed to ‘international frameworks’ that aim            to ensure adequate protection. For example, those of our third party service providers who receive your            personal information in the USA may subscribe to the “EU-US Privacy Shield” framework. Where they do not, we            ensure that we impose contractual obligations on them that are broadly equivalent as required by UK data            protection law. Please contact us using the details at the end of this policy for more information about the            protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy of the relevant documents.</p>        <p>If you use our services whilst you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA            in order to provide you with those services.</p>        <h4>7.

Your rights in relation to your personal                information</h4>            <p><em>You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law. In                relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to verify your identity and, where                applicable, to help us to search for your personal information. Except in rare cases, we will respond to                you within 30 days after we have received this information or, where no such information is required,                after we have received full details of your request.You have the following rights, some of which may                only apply in certain circumstances:</em></p>            <h6>9.1. To be informed about the processing of                your personal information (this is what this policy sets out to do);</h6>            <h6>9.2. To have                your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal information                completed;</h6>            <p>The accuracy of your information is important to us and we make it easy for you to review and correct the                personal information that we hold about you in your Profile. If you change your name or address/email                address, or you discover that any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, you can                let us know by contacting us in any of the details described at the end of this policy but we ask you to                first check that you cannot correct your details using the tools in your Profile.</p>            <p>When downloading a list of backers on their project, project owners will see the address details of those                members who pledged on their project. Please note that if you change your address after the project                owner has downloaded this data (this usually happens once their project is successful) the details the                project owner may become out of date, until the project owner downloads a new list of data - so we would                recommend also contacting the project owner to inform them of a change to your contact details.</p><h6>                9.3. To object to processing of your personal information;</h6>            <p>Where we rely on our legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing your personal information for                particular purposes, you may object to us using your personal information for these purposes by emailing                or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Except for the purposes for which we are sure                we can continue to process your personal information, we will temporarily stop processing your personal                information in line with your objection until we have investigated the matter. If we agree that your                objection is justified in accordance with your rights under data protection laws, we will permanently                stop using your data for those purposes. Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why                we need to continue using your data.</p>            <p>You may object to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes and we will                automatically comply with your request.

We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if this                concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.</p><h6>9.9.                Rights relating to automated decision making, including profiling. </h6>            <p>We do not envisage that any decisions that have a legal or significant effect on you will be taken about                you using purely automated means, however we will update this policy and inform you if this position                changes.</p>            <p>After completing an expression of interest form for funding from one of our partners we will show you                partner funds you may be eligible for.
