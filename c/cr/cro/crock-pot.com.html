JCS/THG, LLC d/b/a The Holmes Group (“THG”) <br>
Last Updated: December 14, 2005<br>
<br>
Your privacy is very important to THG. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information. We want you to fully understand our privacy practices. </p>


 					<p class="legalsubhead">Overview </p>
					
					<p class="legalbody"> The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and subdomains of www.theholmesgroup.com (the "Website(s)") and apply generally to our subsidiaries and joint venture Websites. By disclosing personal information on this Website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you choose not to provide personal information you can still access our Website but it may render you unable to receive product information or participate in promotions offered through the site. <br>
					<br>
This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation of our services; we collect from you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about THG's practices so that you can make informative decisions. All of our subsidiaries and joint ventures operate under similar privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy and, subject to the requirements of applicable law. We strive to provide a consistent set of privacy practices.</p>

					<p class="legalsubhead">Information We Collect and How We Use It</p>
					
                    <p class="legalbody"> THG strives to provide consumers with an informative and pleasant experience while using our Websites. Consumer's personal information and comments allow us to customize our services to make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable. This information also provides insight to new product development and services that are relevant to our consumers needs.</p>
					
<p class="legalbody"><span class="legalbodybold">Personal Information:</span> THG does not collect any personally identifiable information from you (i.e., name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number if you place an order with us) unless you voluntarily choose to provide it. We will not share, sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your prior consent. Your information may be used for research on site usage patterns, new and existing product development, and online site customization. We may use your personal information to contact you regarding your comments or requests for information, to help process an order you have placed through our Website and to deliver information that is targeted to your interests.</p>
					  
					  <p class="legalbody"><span class="legalbodybold">Partner Companies:</span> 
Some THG services are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide these services to you, it is necessary for us to share information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than our partner companies, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. </p>
					
					<p class="legalbody"><span class="legalbodybold">Aggregate and Statistical Information:</span> We collect non-personal information (such as your web browser, operating system, sites visited, etc.) about our customers, and aggregate this statistical information in order to identify well-liked attributes and tailor the design of our Website to meet the consumers needs. When we say that we may share such information in "aggregate" form, we mean that we will not disclose individual names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses unless we have your permission. External companies may be provided aggregate information about our customers. For example, we may let one of our partners know that approximately 10,000 people visited a Webpage regarding a specific joint promotion. </p>
					
					<p class="legalbody"><span class="legalbodybold">IP Addresses:</span> An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When visitors request pages from the Website, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. THG collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of this Website. We also use IP addresses to collect statistical information to send to our advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. </p> 
					
					<p class="legalbody"><span class="legalbodybold">Children's Privacy:</span> THG believes that it is especially important to protect children's privacy online and does not direct its Website to children under thirteen (13) years of age. Individuals under eighteen (18) should consult with their parent or guardian before using this Website for their benefit.</p>
					
					<span class="legalbodybold">Monitoring, Reviewing and Disclosing Information:</span><span class="legalbody"> THG reserves the right at all times to monitor, review, retain, and/or disclose any information as necessary to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by applicable law, regulation or legal process.

Some THG Websites may contain links to other Websites to the extent that you disclose personal information to other sites; you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of these other sites. We encourage and recommend that you read the privacy policy of each site you visit and ask questions before you disclose any personal information.</p>
