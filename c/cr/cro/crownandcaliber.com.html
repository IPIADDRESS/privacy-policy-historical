Donna and Katie are a pleasure to deal with. They are professional and nice too.  I was skeptical about dealing my Breitling on the internet.  Don't be.  Crown and Caliber is the real thing.  Thanks for making it so easy.

																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I just completed a sale of  a luxury watch I owned that I sold to this company. I must say that they were so professional, courteous, and honest with their valuation of my time piece  as well as displayed superb customer service. I was very impressed with the entire process. If you have a high end watch to sell, I highly recommend Crown &amp; Caliber. Thank you Caitlyn for your excellent customer service!

																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> Found them online and contacted Donna who was very professional. They shipped me a box so that I could ship my watch back to them free of charge with insurance. It was nice to do business with people are so knowledgeable about timepieces and who knew what mine was worth. Very smooth transaction and professional staff. I would recommend anyone to do business with them and I will again in the future.

																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> They were easy to work with, prompt, well organized, and fair. They kept their word and did everything they said they would. It requires a leap of faith to send expensive watches to someone you don't know, but based on my experience, the faith is well founded with these folks. I would do business with them again. 
 <br><span> Dan R. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> Thank you Donna. You were very kind and professional, and I would gladly work with you all again.

Money was transferred to me as soon as I said okay. I highly recommend  Crown &amp; Caliber for anyone who is looking to part with there time piece <br><span> Kevin W. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I was very skeptical about doing business over the web so, after researching several different companies, I decided to give it a try. Crown and caliber is a sure definition of  honest, professional, excellent communication, and services to you to make your transaction as easy of possible. I would definitely do business with them again in the near future. Thank you Donna and Katie! <br><span> Ronnie T. </span></blockquote></li>

																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I recently sold my Breitling timepiece to Crown and Caliber and was very impressed! Their process was easy and handled very efficiently by Donna and Katie. Within under 2 weeks time I had made my inquiry, received their offer, accepted the offer, sent them my watch (which is done in the same streamlined fashion) and received my check. I would highly recommend them! <br><span> Beth L. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> Very professional and honest people.  Excellent customer service  with prompt reply to your questions.

																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> Selling an expensive watch is a scary prospect.  How do you get a safe transaction and a decent offer?  Crown &amp; Caliber made it extremely easy.... and comforting.  They send you the packaging - all you have to do is take it to the shipper. I received email correspondence with a real person's name to follow up with.  Received a check very quickly. EXTREMELY happy with their service.
 <br><span> Maureen M. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I just completed a transaction with Crown &amp; Caliber.  They were very professional and the transaction was completed in a timely and efficient manner.  Communication during the entire process was excellent.  I would highly recommend using them if you have a timepiece to sell. <br><span> Dennis K. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I am completely pleased with the entire transaction.  Thank you Katie for a job well done.  You made the entire process painless on my part.  You were efficient and timely; the entire transaction took less than 2 weeks, from my contacting you and receipt of my check.  I would gladly recommend utilizing your service to anyone contemplating selling their used watch. Thank you again.
 <br><span> William H. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I contacted C&amp;C about a week ago concerning a watch I had. After listening about how the process worked I thought, what the heck do I have to lose (other than a Rolex)? Within 2 days I had a shipping box. 2 days later I had a formal quote and 3 business days later I had a direct deposit. It was that simple! Was I bit nervous? Darn betcha I was! Did I need to be? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! I highly recommend C&amp;C to anyone looking to sell! <br><span> Russ C. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> I wanted to thank you for both your time and excellent customer service. I will not hesitate to recommend your services in the future. Donna, I really appreciate your interest in helping me with the watch. <br><span> Sergio M. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> Several years ago, I purchased an IWC Portofino from an unauthorized retailer. I recently sent it to Crown &amp; Caliber to evaluate, where they discovered that the serial numbers had been removed. Donna was extremely gracious in breaking the news to me and promptly returned the watch. You would think that this would have been a negative experience, but it was just the opposite. They were professional and considerate and it is comforting to know that they are a company that refuses to pass something along to their customers that does not meet the highest ethical standards. I want to personally thank C&amp;C for their high standards. We all could benefit from such practices! <br><span> Thomas B. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> At first, I was nervous to deal with an entity on the internet. But Crown &amp; Caliber did everything they said they would. They gave me a top bid and sent the money quickly. If I had to do it again, I would. Thank you	! <br><span> Spunky C. </span></blockquote></li>
																	<li><blockquote cite="http://www.crownandcaliber.com/testimonials/"> One of the most professional companies I have ever done business with. I recently sold an expensive and valuable watch that I have had for many years and had a difficult time trying to sell in all other outlets, not only was my experience with Crown and Caliber LLC the best, but #1 in my book! Call them today!!!

I highly recommend them. <br><span> Tim D. </span></blockquote></li>
