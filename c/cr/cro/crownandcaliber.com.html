<h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p>Like many websites, we and our third-party service providers, such as advertising and analytics providers, use cookies, web beacons and other data technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device.

<ul>

<li>Our third-party service providers may provide us information that tells us how our marketing ads, often placed on third party sites, performed and who clicked on them. This information does not identify any specific individual and is generally non-identifying. If we were to associate it with you we would treat it as personal data.</li>
<li>We may use a uniquely generated trackable toll-free telephone number on our site or in one of our advertisements. If you call one of these uniquely generated toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may collect non-personally identifiable information about the call (e.g. date, time, duration), as well as personally identifiable information (e.g. your name, the number from which your call originated).</li>

<h2 id="sharing-info">Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated within this policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information shared.</p>
<p>We share your information in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>With third party service providers, agents, or contractors.</strong> We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing services to you, including potential third-party purchasers of any items sent to us, as well as credit reporting and fraud checking agencies as necessary.</p>
<p>For example, we may engage Service Providers to process credit card transactions or other payment methods. Or, we may engage Service Providers to provide services such as marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT services, to provide customer service, to collect debts, and to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service). These Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information in order to provide these functions. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services.</p>
<p>If you request services via a mobile device, your request will be transmitted via your mobile carrier’s network and your carrier may have access to it. Consult your carrier’s privacy policy for additional information. We receive information about you (including personal information) from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Crown &amp; Caliber, that website will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You could also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our pages on Facebook or Twitter or another social platform or website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information.</p>
<p>In addition, we receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analytics. </strong>Specifically, for analytics providers, we use Google Analytics Google Analytics which is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &amp; Terms web page: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a> Google also recommends installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on - https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout - for your web browser. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertising. </strong>We may send targeted marketing to you using your personal data we have collected that is based on your interactions with our site which may include your average overall spend. We also use third-party Service Providers to show advertisements, which may include targeted advertisements on a third-party site after you have visited our website. We and the third-party service providers use pixels and cookies to collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services in order to inform, optimize, and measure performance serve ads based on your previous visits to our site. Any tracking that a third party performs is subject to their own privacy notice.</p>
<p>The provider may also use information about your visits to this and other sites to target advertisements for merchandise and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. The provider does not know your name, address, phone number, email address or any of your other personally identifiable information. To opt-out of these ads click on <a href="https://url.emailprotection.link/?aO5M1LHiBElUb8K-g8qefi0B1PdytPTD7WJAFI-LwyXJBjzUvSUCeX5zr8yCs-3GLgROJknOD3AKTP4zkiiQ6ew~~">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Unless your browser settings are configured to make your online activities and publicly available information about your online activities (such as traffic data described above) invisible to usage analytics tools, we do not presently have the capability to omit you from usage analytics to the extent your browser only sends us a “do not track” message and does not otherwise screen you from tracking without any action on our part. If you set your browser for Do Not Track, our third party advertising platforms do honor those signals for advertising related tracking. Please note, however, that our honoring a do not track request from your browser does not affect personal information that you have, or will in the future, submit to us.</p>
<p>Third parties, other than our vendors (such as our website analytics provider), do not have authorization from us to track which websites you visited prior and after visiting our website. That said, we cannot control third party tracking and there could be some third-party tracking over time and across third-party websites that occurs without our knowledge or consent.</p>

Using these technologies helps us recognize you, customize your experience and make relevant marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:\r\n\r\nLog \u0026amp; Device data.

This log data may include your web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location.\r\nOur third-party service providers may provide us information that tells us how our marketing ads, often placed on third party sites, performed and who clicked on them. This information does not identify any specific individual and is generally non-identifying. If we were to associate it with you we would treat it as personal data.\r\nWe may use a uniquely generated trackable toll-free telephone number on our site or in one of our advertisements. If you call one of these uniquely generated toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may collect non-personally identifiable information about the call (e.g. date, time, duration), as well as personally identifiable information (e.g. your name, the number from which your call originated).\r\n\r\n\r\nback to top\r\nUse of cookies\r\nWe may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our site) or similar technologies to record log data. Many browsers default to accepting cookies. You may be able to change this setting in your browser and you can also clear your cookies. If you do, you may lose some functionality of our site.

You can opt-out of receiving emails from us. Please see the Your Choices section below.\r\nWe might also use a pixel tag which is a small graphic file that allows us and third parties to monitor the use of the site and provide us with information based on your interaction with the site. These tags may collect the IP address from the device which you loaded the page, the browser type. Pixel tags are also used by our third parties to collect information when you visit our site, the links and other actions you take on our site, and we may use this information in combination with cookies to display targeted advertisements.\r\nOther data technologies may be used that collect comparable information for security and fraud detection purposes.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about cookies you can go to www.youronlinechoices.com\/uk or to generally find out more about cookies, visit this site.\r\n\r\nback to top\r\nUse of your personal data\r\nWe may use your Personal Data as described below.\r\n\r\nMarketing and Communications\r\n\r\n\r\n\nDeliver the product\/service and customer support\r\n\r\nWe will use Personal Data to provide you access to the Crown \u0026amp; Caliber Services. We use your personal data to provide you customer support. We use Personal Data to manage our contractual relationship with you and\/or because we have a legitimate interest to do so. If you do not provide the data that we request, or prohibit us from collecting such data, we may not be able to provide the requested Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nBusiness Purposes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe use personal data to analyze our product and services, as well as the sites, and to perform audits, security and fraud monitoring and prevention. We also use personal data to develop new services, enhance, improve or modify our existing service, identify usage trends, determine the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and to operate our business. We use Personal Data as described to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation and\/or because we have a legitimate interest to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback to top\r\nSharing and Disclosure\r\nWe do not share your personal information with others except as indicated within this policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information shared.\r\nWe share your information in the following ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith third party service providers, agents, or contractors. We use other companies, agents or contractors (\"Service Providers\") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing services to you, including potential third-party purchasers of any items sent to us, as well as credit reporting and fraud checking agencies as necessary.\r\nFor example, we may engage Service Providers to process credit card transactions or other payment methods. Or, we may engage Service Providers to provide services such as marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT services, to provide customer service, to collect debts, and to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service). These Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information in order to provide these functions. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services.\r\nIf you request services via a mobile device, your request will be transmitted via your mobile carrier’s network and your carrier may have access to it. Consult your carrier’s privacy policy for additional information. We receive information about you (including personal information) from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Crown \u0026amp; Caliber, that website will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You could also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our pages on Facebook or Twitter or another social platform or website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information.\r\nIn addition, we receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalytics. Specifically, for analytics providers, we use Google Analytics Google Analytics which is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.\r\nYou can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy \u0026amp; Terms web page: http:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en\/policies\/privacy\/ Google also recommends installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on - https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/gaoptout - for your web browser. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertising. We may send targeted marketing to you using your personal data we have collected that is based on your interactions with our site which may include your average overall spend. We also use third-party Service Providers to show advertisements, which may include targeted advertisements on a third-party site after you have visited our website. We and the third-party service providers use pixels and cookies to collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services in order to inform, optimize, and measure performance serve ads based on your previous visits to our site. Any tracking that a third party performs is subject to their own privacy notice.\r\nThe provider may also use information about your visits to this and other sites to target advertisements for merchandise and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. The provider does not know your name, address, phone number, email address or any of your other personally identifiable information. To opt-out of these ads click on this link.\r\nUnless your browser settings are configured to make your online activities and publicly available information about your online activities (such as traffic data described above) invisible to usage analytics tools, we do not presently have the capability to omit you from usage analytics to the extent your browser only sends us a “do not track” message and does not otherwise screen you from tracking without any action on our part. If you set your browser for Do Not Track, our third party advertising platforms do honor those signals for advertising related tracking. Please note, however, that our honoring a do not track request from your browser does not affect personal information that you have, or will in the future, submit to us.\r\nThird parties, other than our vendors (such as our website analytics provider), do not have authorization from us to track which websites you visited prior and after visiting our website. That said, we cannot control third party tracking and there could be some third-party tracking over time and across third-party websites that occurs without our knowledge or consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnique Marketing Practices in the United States:\r\nWe may use third party service providers to send targeted direct mail based on your browsing activity on the site.\r\nWe work with a third party ad network that uses a pixel placed on our site that collects shopping click information from our site and shares it with other retailers who opt into the same ad platform. Name, email, address, phone or other similar personally identifying information is not shared with this third party ad network. The other participating retailers can serve a targeted ad to you through online ads on third party sites.\r\nYou can opt out of this tracking at any time as described in the choices section of this privacy notice.\r\nAd Vendors\r\nWe work with Google AdSense \u0026amp; DoubleClick Cookie Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.

We use other companies, agents or contractors (\"Service Providers\") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing services to you, including potential third-party purchasers of any items sent to us, as well as credit reporting and fraud checking agencies as necessary.\r\nFor example, we may engage Service Providers to process credit card transactions or other payment methods. Or, we may engage Service Providers to provide services such as marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT services, to provide customer service, to collect debts, and to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service). These Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information in order to provide these functions. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services.\r\nIf you request services via a mobile device, your request will be transmitted via your mobile carrier’s network and your carrier may have access to it. Consult your carrier’s privacy policy for additional information. We receive information about you (including personal information) from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Crown \u0026amp; Caliber, that website will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You could also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our pages on Facebook or Twitter or another social platform or website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information.\r\nIn addition, we receive information about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalytics. Specifically, for analytics providers, we use Google Analytics Google Analytics which is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.\r\nYou can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy \u0026amp; Terms web page: http:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en\/policies\/privacy\/ Google also recommends installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on - https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/gaoptout - for your web browser. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertising. We may send targeted marketing to you using your personal data we have collected that is based on your interactions with our site which may include your average overall spend. We also use third-party Service Providers to show advertisements, which may include targeted advertisements on a third-party site after you have visited our website. We and the third-party service providers use pixels and cookies to collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services in order to inform, optimize, and measure performance serve ads based on your previous visits to our site. Any tracking that a third party performs is subject to their own privacy notice.\r\nThe provider may also use information about your visits to this and other sites to target advertisements for merchandise and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. The provider does not know your name, address, phone number, email address or any of your other personally identifiable information. To opt-out of these ads click on this link.\r\nUnless your browser settings are configured to make your online activities and publicly available information about your online activities (such as traffic data described above) invisible to usage analytics tools, we do not presently have the capability to omit you from usage analytics to the extent your browser only sends us a “do not track” message and does not otherwise screen you from tracking without any action on our part. If you set your browser for Do Not Track, our third party advertising platforms do honor those signals for advertising related tracking. Please note, however, that our honoring a do not track request from your browser does not affect personal information that you have, or will in the future, submit to us.\r\nThird parties, other than our vendors (such as our website analytics provider), do not have authorization from us to track which websites you visited prior and after visiting our website. That said, we cannot control third party tracking and there could be some third-party tracking over time and across third-party websites that occurs without our knowledge or consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnique Marketing Practices in the United States:\r\nWe may use third party service providers to send targeted direct mail based on your browsing activity on the site.\r\nWe work with a third party ad network that uses a pixel placed on our site that collects shopping click information from our site and shares it with other retailers who opt into the same ad platform. Name, email, address, phone or other similar personally identifying information is not shared with this third party ad network.
