                    users to more easily evaluate the use of personal information 
                    collected by the web sites they visit. Thus, if your browser

                  <p><strong>Collection and use of non-personal information</strong><br>
                    If you visit ShopLocal.com™, we do not collect any personally 
                    identifiable information about you (such as your name, address,

                    however, collect non-personally-identifiable (anonymous) information 
                    about you, such as the server your computer is logged into 
                    or your browser type. Other examples of non-personally-identifiable 
                    information include: </p>

                      assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web; 
                      many Web servers automatically identify your computer by 
                      its IP address). </li>

                  <p> ShopLocal.com™ collects data from the Web logs of

                    pages -- delivering the ShopLocal.com™ content. This 
                    includes information about what you view and, along with information 
                    gathered from our other users, we create “aggregate

                    including our clients with whom we have entered into an agreement 
                    to provide such information. We may also study aggregate data 
                    in order to enhance our existing services or develop new services. 
                    We will not disclose any personal information to a third party 
                    without your express prior written authorization. We can and 
                    will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is

                  <p><strong>Use of cookies</strong><br>
                    ShopLocal.com™ uses cookies on our web site. Cookies 
                    are used for record keeping, to track your movements when 
                    you visit a Web site and to help us determine what type of 
                    information to present to you. The use of cookies is an industry 
                    standard - you’ll find them used at most Web sites. 
                    Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information 
                    about you, and do not damage or alter your system files in 
                    any way. The first time you visit our web site, ShopLocal.com™ 
                    assigns you a unique, anonymous, ID, which is stored in the 
                    cookie on your computer. </p>
                  <p><strong>Collection of personal information</strong><br>
                    ShopLocal.com™ requests location information in order 
                    to create a personalized Shopping Zone for you. A Shopping 
                    Zone allows us to determine which sales and deals are available 
                    at stores near you. When providing location information, you 
                    may enter a city and State or a Zip Code. If you choose to 
                    register for Email Alerts, we do require your email address. 
                    We will not share any of this information with any third party 
                    unless you explicitly ask us to. The Email Alerts feature 
                    offers the opportunity to receive email regarding special 
                    offers from ShopLocal.com™. If you request this information, 
                    we will send the appropriate information to the email address 
                    you provide. If you don’t request this information, 
                    we won’t send it to you. ShopLocal.com™ does not 
                    share any contact information with third parties. Users, both 
                    registered and unregistered, may opt to use a feature on ShopLocal.com™ 
                    called “Share This Page.” This site feature allows 
                    the user to notify someone, via email, about a deal found 
                    on ShopLocal.com™. Use of this feature requires the 
                    user to enter the email address to which this information 
                    will be sent. Email addresses entered through the Share This 
                    Page feature will not be used for any other purpose. </p>

                    identify you. </p>
                  <p><strong>Retention of information</strong><br>
                    Any information we collect may be retained for an indeterminate

                  <p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong><br>
                    ShopLocal.com™ has implemented generally accepted standards

                    of the Internet, and therefore beyond ShopLocal’s control, 
                    and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable 
                    law or governmental regulation. We do not control cookies

                    ShopLocal.com™ is not a commercial Web site or an online

                  <p><strong>Changes to this privacy policy</strong><br>
                    All versions of this privacy policy are dated with the effective 
                    date (the date on which the policy was posted to ShopLocal.com™). 
                    ShopLocal.com™ will only use the information we learn 
                    about you in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in 
                    effect when the information was collected from you. However, 
                    we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy 
                    at any time by posting revisions to our site. </p>
                  <p><strong>Changes in corporate structure</strong><br>
                    If ShopLocal.com™ is sold, merged or otherwise transferred 
                    to another entity, the personal information you have provided 
                    at this site may be transferred as part of that transaction. 
                    However, ShopLocal.com™ will take steps to assure that 
                    any personal information is used in a manner consistent with 
                    the ShopLocal.com™ privacy policy under which it was 
                    collected. </p>
                  <p><strong>Effect of Legal Obligations upon this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                    ShopLocal.com™ may disclose user information in special 
                    cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this 
                    information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal 
                    action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference 
                    with (either intentionally or unintentionally) ShopLocal’s 
                    rights or property, other ShopLocal.com™ users, or anyone 
                    else that could be harmed by such activities. ShopLocal.com™ 
                    may disclose user information when we believe in good faith 
                    that the law requires it. </p>
                  <p><strong>Effect of Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                    This privacy policy is not intended to and does not create 
                    any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party. 
                    As noted above, we may revise this privacy policy from time 
                    to time in our sole discretion. </p>
