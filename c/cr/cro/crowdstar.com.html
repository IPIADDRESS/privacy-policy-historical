CrowdStar Privacy Policy
</div>

CrowdStar International, Limited and its related entities, including CrowdStar, Inc., (collectively "CrowdStar", “us”, “our” or "we") is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with our website at www.crowdstar.com (the “Site”) or any CrowdStar game or application provided on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the "Service"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to  information collected by CrowdStar through your use of the Service.
<p>
By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for periodically reading this Privacy Policy.  If you use our Service after we have updated this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices. Use of the Service after changes are made to the Privacy Policy will be considered your consent to the new terms.
</p><p>
</p><div class="t">Information Collected and Used</div>
CrowdStar's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service.
When you use any of the CrowdStar games or applications, we may collect and record information through the social networking website you use to access the Service ("SN Website") or other third party source in accordance with the policies and terms of the SN Website or service provider.  
<p>
We may collect both Personal and Non-Personal Information.  Personal Information is defined as information about you that can be used to contact or identify you such as your name, email address, home address, and phone number. Personal Information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the Service, from which any Personal Information has been removed.  Non-Personal Information does not identify you personally and can include age, gender or interests.  We may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and use this combination to improve your experience or  to aggregate it with information collected from other users to improve or analyze our Service. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of Non-Personal Information.
</p><p>
The information we collect when you access the Service on an SN Website may include information that is visible on your social networking page such as: (1) your name, (2) SN Website user identification number and/or name, (3) locale, city, state and country, (4) sex, (5) birthdate, (6) time zone and (7) email address.  We may also collect your email address directly from you when you access our Service.  If you provide your email address in connection with a CrowdStar game, the email address will be retained by CrowdStar and we may use that email address to contact you about other CrowdStar games.  
</p><p>
When you visit our Site or use the Service on an SN Website, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses are logged automatically.  We also collect information about your usage and activity, such as number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services. 
</p><p>
We may also acquire information from you through (1) your access and participation in message boards on the Service, (2) your email of a question to our customer support , (3) your purchase of a virtual product of any type, (4) your participation in surveys regarding the Service or (5) your participation in a sweepstakes or contest through the Service. Please note that because third parties manage the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we do not have access to your credit card details and billing information. 
</p><p>
If you launch any of our games or applications on a mobile device, we may also collect information regarding your device type, operating system and version, IP address and unique device ID.  

</p><div class="t">Cookies</div>
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk, generally to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access or view content of a CrowdStar game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your Personal Information for purposes such as improving the quality of our Service, tailoring recommendations to your interests, and making the Service easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.
<p>
We may feature advertisements served by third party advertising companies which deliver cookies to your computer so the ads you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies tag your computer with a number, they  will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use Non-Personal Information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We will not provide these third party advertising companies with any Personal Information.  
</p><p>
For example, we have contracted with certain companies to place tool bars and advertisements on our applications for cross-promotion purposes.   These companies may monitor certain pages of our Service for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement “click-thrus,” and/or other activities on our Service.  They use monitoring technologies to compile statistics about our Service visitors. 

</p><div class="t">Web Beacons</div>
We may collect information using Web beacons.  Web beacons or “gifs”, are electronic images that may be used on our Site or in our emails.  We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

<div class="t">Links</div>
The Service may contain links to other websites.
