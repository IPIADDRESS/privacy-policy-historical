   <p>We and our service providers may collect information about Website Visitors online activities over time and across our Websites, third-party websites or other online services, and we may collect similar information about the online activities of Customers and End-Users within our Applications.  As you navigate through and interact with our Websites and Applications, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:</p>

    <ul class="checkmarks">
     <li>Details of your visits to our Services, such as the date and time you access our Services, length of time you spend on our Services, websites you visited before or after our Services, the resources and content that you access and use on the Services, and whether your interaction with our Services results in your requesting information about Vendini or making a purchase.</li>
    <li>Information about your computer and internet connection, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the Application) you are using.</li>
</ul>

     <p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>

    <ul class="checkmarks">
   <li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong>  A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.  You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access or receive certain parts of our Services.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Websites or receive our Services.  For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.com/">www.allaboutcookies.com.</a> </li>
    <li><strong>Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies.</strong> A “session” cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser.  A “persistent” cookie remains on the user’s device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted.  A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user’s hard drive.  Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user’s individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and end users of our Services who log in to their Vendini accounts may be individually identifiable to particular Services using session cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> Certain features of our Services may use local storage, such as “Flash cookies” to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Websites.  Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.  For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages on our Services and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs). Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email.  Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users -- for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). This enables Vendini to provide a website experience more tailored to your preferences and interests.</li>
    <p>At this time we do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.  You can learn about how you can adjust your browser’s settings to limit or disable cookies and other tracking technologies by visiting the section below titled “Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information.”</p>

   <p>When you access and use the Services and other websites, we may serve you advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you (or in some cases, to users who our service providers deem to have characteristics similar to our customers) based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites.

    <p>We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements from our Customers to their target audience of users.  As one example, meeting space providers may purchase advertisements which are presented selectively through the Vendini Supplier Network to meeting planners who have previously awarded a minimum volume of meetings business to that provider or to competing venues in the target metropolitan area.  Even though we do not disclose Personal Information for these purposes, if an End-User clicks on or otherwise interacts with an advertisement, the advertising Customer may assume that the End-User meets its target criteria.</p>
    <p>We use third party analytics providers, including Quantcast, Google, Adobe, Mixpanel, Mouseflow and others, to collect information about your use of the Services and enable us to improve how the Services work.

      <h2>What's New</h2>
  <p>We recently changed our Privacy Policy in order to better explain our practices in connection with the information that we collect through our online Services. Here's a summary of what's changed from our old policy:</p>
  <ul class="checkmarks">
<li>We added a section listing in greater detail the types of information that we or our customers may collect, such as: name, title, organization, email address, phone number, information about your dietary preferences, geographic region, interests and online activities, demographic information, and payment card or billing information.</li>
<li>We described in greater detail how we collect information when you fill in forms, perform searches or post comments through the services, and how we may collect and use information in connection with social media accounts that you use to access our services.  Please note that Vendini does not use or disclose personally identifiable information collected by Vendini customers (or by Vendini on behalf of customers) through the services (for example, through event registration, survey responses, or mobile applications) for any purpose other than providing the services (with a limited exception for CrowdTorch ticketing users who may receive the promotional materials described in the next paragraph).  Our customers' use of personal information collected through the services is governed by the privacy policies of such customers, not by our Privacy Policy.  </li>
<li>We let you know that we may use your email address to contact you about products and services that may be of interest to you, and we may use or disclose your contact information to provide you with optional newsletters and complimentary subscriptions to trade magazines and venue or artist newsletters.</li>
<li>We described in greater detail how we use collected information to present our services to you, provide you with information and services that you request, communicate with you regarding your account and other products or services that may interest you, allow you to participate in interactive features and sweepstakes, tailor your website experience to your interests and preferences, perform our business purposes and, in certain other circumstances, as we believe necessary or appropriate.</li>
<li>We described how we use various automatic data collection technologies to collect information about how you use and interact with our websites, apps or emails, and that we or our service providers may use information collected about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or our Websites to deliver more relevant advertisements to you.</li>
<li>We listed some additional circumstances under which we may disclose your information, for example in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of the company.</li>
<li>Finally, we provided more detail regarding how we give you choices to access or change information collected about you or to opt-out of our practices, and how we store, retain, or transfer information in the United States and other countries.</li>
