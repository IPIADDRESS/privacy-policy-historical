            <a name="cookies" id="#cookies"></a>
            <h2 class="sub-head">Cookies</h2>
            <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Definition.</span> A cookie is a small data file placed in a user's web browser or written to a user's hard drive when a website is accessed.  A "session" cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser. A "persistent" cookie remains on the user's device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted. A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user's hard drive. Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user's individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and website users who log in to their CrowdTorch accounts may be individually identifiable to particular CrowdTorch applications using session cookies. </p>

			<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Use.</span> CrowdTorch uses cookies to improve user experience, monitor website usage and gather information which helps CrowdTorch improve the site content and applications. For example, cookies are used to distinguish between and authenticate users, save usernames and login status (so that users don't have to log in more than once each time they access secured portions of the site), keep track of user-specific settings such as language, layout and other preferences, and manage session information to minimize data entry and for general ease of use. Cookies are also used to "time-out" user sessions that are idle for an extended period of time. CrowdTorch may also use cookies to gather statistical and other information about how the website is used, assess the effectiveness of advertising, monitor access and use of particular content and provide tailored advertising and other content to users. Using cookies in the foregoing manner makes the website more effective, easier to use, improves security and efficiency, and is essential for the continuous improvement of CrowdTorch's systems. Consequently, accepting these cookies is necessary for many uses of the website and blocking or restricting cookies may limit a user's ability to access certain website content and functionality.</p>

			<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blocking/Restricting Cookies.</span> Users may set their web browsers to restrict or to entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.  Information on how to do this should be provided in the web browser's help/reference section. Users who block cookies may be able to access the CrowdTorch website but will not be able to use most of the content, applications and services CrowdTorch makes available on the website. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a user from using certain portions of the CrowdTorch website, depending on how the browser settings are configured. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Choice</h2>
            <p>CrowdTorch users may choose whether or not to submit Personal Information while using CrowdTorch's services. In some cases, choosing to withhold Personal Information, may limit a user's ability to use all of CrowdTorch's services. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Security</h2>
            <p>CrowdTorch has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under its control. CrowdTorch protects secure data with industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. CrowdTorch periodically reviews and improves its security and privacy policies as necessary. Only pre-authorized individuals have access to CrowdTorch servers and information provided by its users. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Data Integrity</h2>
            <p>CrowdTorch will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that Personal Information is relevant accurate, complete and current, to its intended use. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Access and Correction</h2>
            <p>CrowdTorch users may change or modify previously submitted Personal Information by (i) using the EventCenter or (ii) sending an email request to <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com</a>. Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is infallible. Any information transmitted through the CrowdTorch application is done at the user's own risk. Once CrowdTorch receives the information, it will take every reasonable precaution to ensure its security. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Enforcement</h2>
            <p>CrowdTorch will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy and the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles. Any employee that CrowdTorch determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Web Site Links</h2>
            <p>The CrowdTorch website may contain links to other web sites. CrowdTorch is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these web sites. </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-head">Notification of Changes</h2>
            <p>As this Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, please check back periodically to review any changes. The last modified date will be provided at the bottom of the page. </p>
