<h3 class="content__heading content__heading--green">Data Collection and Processing When Visiting Our Website</h3>

<h3 class="content__heading content__heading--green">Collection and Processing of Personal Data and Consent</h3>
<p class="content__text">We collect, process and use personal data such as your name, postal address, email address or other contact details <b>only if they have been entered by you on the website and transmitted to us</b> and to the extent that such collection, processing and use is permitted by law or covered by your consent.</p>

We collect your contact information (i.e., mail and e-mail addresses), financial information (i.e., credit card numbers), and demographic information (i.e., zip code and state). We use this contact information from the order form to send you a confirmation email for which you cannot opt out.

We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.</p>
<p class="content__text">In addition, if your prior consent is required for certain data collection, processing and use, such as service telephone calls and the use of our newsletter or our information e-mails, we will, of course, ask you for your consent beforehand at the corresponding section of our website ask.

</ul>
<h2 class="content__heading content__heading--dark-gray">5. Automatic logging</h2>
<p class="content__text">Our web servers automatically save every access or retrieval of a website or file belonging to our website temporarily in a log file. The following data is stored until its automated deletion after evaluation by the web analytics software Google Analytics we use:</p>
<ul class="content__text">

<li>URL of the referring web page, if access was via link, and additionally search term, if access was via search engine</li>
<li>Name of your Internet access provider</li>
</ul>
<p class="content__text">Any data that can not be assigned to specific person(s) is not personal data. This data, or a transfer of this data does not automatically result in the creation of a personal user profiles. The processing of the data takes place exclusively for the purpose of enabling the use of the website (connection establishment), for internal system-related purposes such as technical administration and system security purposes and for the needs-based design and optimization of this website using our web analytics software Google Analytics.</p>
<h2 id="cookies" class="content__heading content__heading--dark-gray">6. Cookie Policy</h2>
<p class="content__text">Our web servers store so-called “cookies” in the memory of your browser, ie small text files with data that serve the technical session control, in particular the identification of the browser for the duration of the visit to the website. These cookies will be deleted automatically 120 days after your visit to our website. They facilitate the navigation through our website and allow us to optimize the website to your needs and anonymous evaluation of the general user behavior based on the number of visitors.</p>
<p class="content__text">When you visit any of our websites, a cookie may be placed on your computer for a number of reasons, such as (a) to keep track of your shopping cart, (b) to recognize you when you return to our site, (c) to recognize whether a customer came to our site as a result of a promotion or advertisement with one of our partners sites or email campaign and (d) to track the sales made by customers referred to us from a 3rd party so that they can receive compensation under our affiliate program. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from crossfitinvictus.com websites, you may not be able to view all the text on the screens, or to experience a personalized visit, or to subscribe to certain service and product offerings on our sites.</p>
<p class="content__text">We also collect anonymous visitor information about how you utilize our site, such as IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla, etc.), referring pages and pages visited. We use this information (a) to perform anonymous statistical analysis of Web page traffic patterns, (b) to administer our Website and servers, and (c) to improve our services.</p>
<p class="content__text">Of course you can also view our website without cookies. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">You can prevent the storage of cookies</a> or be warned of cookies by saving your browser by setting your browser settings accordingly. You can find more information about these functions in the help menu of your browser. However, you may be exposed to some of our website features, web pages, or parts thereof, e.g. For example, if you restrict the use of cookies, you can use them only to a limited extent or not at all.</p>
<h3 class="content__heading content__heading--green">Clear GIFS (“Web Beacons”)</h3>
<p class="content__text">Clear GIFs, also known as “web beacons” or “single-pixel GIF’s” are very small images (typically 1 x 1 pixel) that help websites understand their customers better. While any type of file can operate as a web beacon, clear GIFs are most popular because their very small file size prevents them from interfering in the websites’ operation. Clear GIFs function like cookies, in that they are used to track and measure online actions taken by website users. In contrast to cookies clear GIFs are not stored on a user’s hard drive, but are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of web pages. Web pages and graphical emails use codes that tell your computer what to do when a page is opened. While they typically contain text and graphics that you see on the screen, often web pages also contain instructions or tags’ that then ask the website’s server to send you further content (such as an image or a block of text that changes frequently). Web beacons are retrieved in the same way as the text and graphics that you see on a website or in an email, and the action of calling the material from another server allows the event to be counted. When a user’s browser requests information from our Site we may use GIFs to gather “passive” information such as the IP address of your computer; the time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the prior existence of cookies from our Site. This is information that could be gathered through the use of cookies. Web beacons do not give any “extra” information away. They are simply a convenient way for us to gather the simple statistics and manage cookies. Clear GIFs may be used by third parties to monitor activity on the Site. Turning off the browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity, but web beacons may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address.</p>
<h3 class="content__heading content__heading--green">Facebook</h3>
<p class="content__text">Facebook Tools are used on the website and may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from your websites and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target adds. You can opt out of the collection and find more information on your choices here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.</p>
<h3 class="content__heading content__heading--green">Google Analytics</h3>
<p class="content__text">This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="content__text">Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address provided by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.</p>
<p class="content__text">You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website to the fullest extent possible. In addition, you may prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading the browser plug-in available under the following link and install (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).</p>
<h3 class="content__heading content__heading--green">Google Remarketing and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
<p class="content__text">Like many other websites, this website uses Google Remarketing, a web service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google uses so-called cookies, small text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. The IP address is then shortened by Google for the last three digits, a clear assignment of the IP address is therefore no longer possible. Google complies with the US Safe Harbor Privacy Policy and is registered with the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program. Google will use this stored information then use your other sites to selectively display interest-based ads from us, Google, or third parties based on previous visits to this site. To this end, Google may also link this information with other anonymous usage data and transfer it to third parties, if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Google will never associate your IP address with other Google data. You may disable the use of cookies by Google by using the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/anonymous?sig=ACi0TChS6ioGWYjsRwxSkDVTtbrJuegXe3bxbQEUjYR0QatVz41li57ma7sQFuv5FjEt72sF_UnnjBH_fiVD9koBk5HPDJqCUpbSVc5php-f76cL8N7aYoQ&amp;hl=de">Google advertising opt-out page.</a> Alternatively, you can disable the use of third-party cookies by visiting the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt-out page of the Network Advertising Initiative. </a> We point out, however, that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website in full.</p>
<p class="content__text">Like many other websites, this website also uses the Google AdWords online advertising program and, as part of that, Google Conversion Tracking to measure which websites our ads work best on. Google AdWords sets a cookie on your computer if you’ve reached this website through a Google ad. These cookies lose their validity after 540 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we may recognize that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to this page. Each advertiser receives different cookies. Cookies can not be tracked through the websites of advertisers. The information obtained by using the conversion cookie is used to determine which visitors have triggered a specific action on our site through advertisements. We learn the total number of users who clicked on our ads, and which clicks resulted in an action. However, we do not receive any information that personally identifies a user. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking process, you can clear or disable the Google Conversion Tracking cookie from your Internet browser under User Preferences by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain “googleadservices.com”. You will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
<p class="content__text">By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the context of Google Remarketing and Google Conversion Tracking in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Please refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/privacy.html">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> before using this website if necessary.</p>
