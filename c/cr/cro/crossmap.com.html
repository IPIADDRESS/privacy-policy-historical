<!--                             <p>Crossmap may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Crossmap, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for Crossmap. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p> -->
<!--                             <p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p> -->
<!--                             <p>Users that register for Crossmap' wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Crossmap. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, Crossmap, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</p> -->
<!--                             <p class="pt10"><span class="fw_b">a. Registration.</span> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Crossmap' wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt&#45;in" or the "double&#45;opt&#45;in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Crossmap depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt&#45;in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p> -->
<!--                             <p><span class="fw_b">i. Single Opt&#45;in Method:</span> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Crossmap will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Crossmap to send text messages to him or her. Crossmap will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Crossmap or by sending a text message to Crossmap that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".</p> -->
<!--                             <p><span class="fw_b">ii. Double Opt&#45;in (Site/SMS) Method:</span> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Crossmap' sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Crossmap) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. Crossmap will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Crossmap to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Crossmap' wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Crossmap may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Crossmap continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p> -->

<!--                             <p class="pt10"><span class="fw_b">b. Termination of Wireless Services by User.</span> Regardless of which one of the above opt&#45;in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Crossmap by the following procedure:</p> -->
<!--                             <p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Crossmap at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". Crossmap will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with Crossmap. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Crossmap service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt&#45;in.</p> -->
<!--                             <p class="pt10"><span class="fw_b">c. Termination of Wireless Services by Crossmap.</span> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Crossmap may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. Crossmap may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p> -->

Crossmap will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. International Realty will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p> -->
