CRUSH.COM PRIVACY POLICY
<p>THIS POLICY WAS LAST UPDATED ON May 9, 2009</p>

<p><b><span class="title3">Crush  Privacy Policy</span></b></p>

<p>Crush Incorporated ("we" or " Crush  ")
have adopted this privacy policy to protect your personal information and to
let you know how we might use it. This privacy policy only applies to activities you perform on the
Crush  website, transactions for purchasing Crush  subscription
services, and activities or communications that occur using the Crush 
service (collectively known as the "Service") and does not apply to any other
Website or offline point of contact between Crush, Crush, or any
other company, and consumers. This policy was implemented on January 1, 2003
this policy may change from time-to-time, please periodically review this
page. Each time you use the Service
or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices
described in this privacy policy at that time.</p>


<p><b>Your IP Address</b></p>
<p>Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you
use the Service, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page
from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Service for you
and to diagnose problems, we use your IP address to help identify you and to
gather broad demographic information about you.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p>Like most Websites, the Service uses
cookies to keep track of your purchases and other activity on the website to
enhance your experience. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to
your interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other
personal and financial information so you do not have to reenter it each time
you use the Service. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or
read cookies on your browser. If you wish to disable these cookies, the
"help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how.
However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to
access certain aspects of the Service.</p><p><b>Information We Collect From You</b></p>
<p>In order to operate the Service and to
provide you with information about products or services that may be of
interest to you, we may collect "personal information" (i.e.
information that could be used to contact you directly without using the
service" demographic information" (i.e. information that you
submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor
financial information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code,
postal code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, purchase history
information, browsing history information, searching history information,
registration history information, and the content of communications between
you and other members over the Service), subject to the rest of this
paragraph. Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1)
"non-public information", which consists of purchase history
information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the
Service; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other
demographic information. We ask that you do not enter personal information or
financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your address
or passcode as your username, or include your name or address in your written
responses), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Service,
and the information will then be treated as "demographic
information" that is "public information." Please note that
nowhere on the Service do we knowingly collect personal information from
children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us
that they are at least 18 years old.</p>

<p><b>Information Other Websites Collect From You</b></p>
<p>On the Service websites, we may place
links to other Websites operated by other parties. Some of these other
Websites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual
property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit
these other Websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand
names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that
we do not control these other Websites or these other Websites' business
practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other
Websites. Consequently, the operators of these other Websites may collect
different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that
information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the Service.
We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will
not be responsible for their actions.</p>
<p><b>How We Use Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Crush is committed to treating your
personal information with the highest degree of care. Your email address
and personal information is not shared with any third parties and is solely used
to send email communication from Crush . Your personal information will not be
resold to any third party. We use your email address and your other
personal information to help us efficiently operate the Service, to contact
you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the Service
(including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that
could affect your relationship with Crush ), and to forward messages to
you from other Crush  users. These types of communications are known as
"Operational Communications." In some cases, Operational
Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and
special offers.</p>
<p>We also use personal information to send
you newsletters, information, offers and other promotional materials for
Crush 's or third parties' goods or services. We attempt to send you
offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or
special event information. The Service provides you with options to decline
to receive communications from Crush  (other than those contained in
Operational Communications). Some of these options may only be for a certain
category of communications; others may be more general. By posting a profile
on the Service, you are opting in to receive messages from other Crush 
members by email or text message. To stop receiving messages from other
Crush  members, change your account settings on Crush.</p>
<p>To operate the Service, including
processing your transactions and supporting your activities on the Service,
we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives,
contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support
services such as authorization of credit card transactions, email
origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management
services, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment. We
require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>By purchasing, or registering or making
reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties
on the Service, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or
magazine subscriptions) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes
or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or
sponsored by third parties on the Service, you consent to our providing your
personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your
personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will
need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your
preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally,
you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to
such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and
disclose any other information you submit to us.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may enter into a
promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display
their brand name or trademarks on pages of the Service. These pages are known
as "Co-Branded Pages" and these companies are known as "Co-Branded
Companies." If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page,
or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share
your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded
Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own
privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct
them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal
information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all
such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner
in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit
to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web
Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party, may use to read cookies
that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other
(non-Crush ) web sites before your visit to Crush. This technology
is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other Websites
that promote Co-Branded Pages. Further, such other third parties may use the
information collected through this technology to learn more about your visits
to this Service and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about
goods and services of interest to you.</p>
<p>Any third party with whom we are allowed
to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal
information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third
parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have
no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of
their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed
directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal
information by them.</p>
<p>Please read the information below under
the heading "Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial
Information" to learn more ways in which we may share your personal
information.</p>
	
<p><b>How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information</b></p>
<p>We may review all demographic information.
We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to
determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We
may use demographic information to tailor the Service and communications to
your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on
an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your
identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood
that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to Crush 's users,
so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our
sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do
not tell advertisers which particular Crush  users are members of which
demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you
respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad
that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser
your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as
being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we
disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded
Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company
your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one
communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we
may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis as
described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases in which we Share
Personal and Financial Information." Also, to read further details about
how we may use your public information, see our Terms
of Use.</p>
<p><b>Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</b></p>
<p>If at any point we decide to use
particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from
that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an
email or by providing 30 days notice on the Service. Please note that we will
continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and
how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as
described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such
changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the
change.</p>
<p><b>How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information and Public Information</b></p>
<p>We give you the opportunity to opt-out of
certain communications and modify personal information or demographic
information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic information
from, or make demographic information visible to, the public users of the
Service, at anytime by going to the "Account Settings" in your Crush 
profile of the Service. Please be aware that it may take several hours for
the changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the Service. We
thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or deleting your
information in the "Account Settings" section of the Service, or otherwise
opting-out of receipt of email communications from Crush , will only
change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities
on the Service and for managing future communications from Crush . These
changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that we
may have already forwarded to other users or credit card companies or any
other third parties, all as provided above in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns
about this privacy policy, the practices of the Service, or your dealings
with the Service, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@crush.com">support@crush.com</a> or by calling +1-305-712-6613.
