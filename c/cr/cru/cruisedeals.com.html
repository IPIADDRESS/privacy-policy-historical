        - For any other purposes about  which we notify customers and users; and <br>

      <p><strong>How Do We Use  Preference Based Advertising, Analytics, and Services? </strong><br>
        <strong>Disclosures As Required  By Law </strong><strong> </strong><br>
        We do not currently share your information that we collect  for preference-based advertising purposes and we do not currently have any  plans to do so through this Site. <br>
        If we do in the future work with third parties for  preference-based advertising, then we will do so in accordance with this  section and you can opt out as explained below. Such third parties may include  third party advertising networks and website analysis firms who use cookies and  web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit  our Site and third-party sites. The information collected through cookies and/or  web beacons, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent  on pages, and links clicked, is often used by these advertising networks to  serve you with advertisements, while you are on our Site and/or on third party  sites, that better reflect your preferences and needs. This information may be  used by Company and these third parties to analyze and track data, determine  the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to  your interests on our products and services, and better understand your online  activity. For more information on how this type of advertising works, go to <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/">https://www.aboutads.info/</a>. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Who Else Do We Share  Your Information with and Why? </strong><br>
        We may share your personal information with one or several of  our business partners to make an initial determination of the services you may  need, to process your employment application, or to otherwise facilitate our  business operations. We also share your personal information as necessary with  airlines, hotels and other providers for whose services you have requested our  assistance. We may also share your information to protect and defend the rights  and property of Company. <br>
  <u>Third Party Providers</u>: We may use third parties to  assist in processing your employment applications, fulfilling your service  requests, or providing other important information to you. We require all such  service providers to act in compliance with this Privacy Policy. We may also  share your personal information with third parties, including our affiliates,  or with employees, agents, consultants and other parties who require the  information to assist us to establish, maintain and manage our business  relationship with you. Further, we may share your personal information with our  partners and affiliates to promote other services to you that you might like or  to show you ads in which you might be interested. <br>
  <u>Email Communications</u>: We may share your email  contact information with our partners to assist with marketing our products and  services. You may unsubscribe from receiving future commercial email  communications from us by clicking the âunsubscribeâ link included at the  bottom of any marketing emails we send, or by emailing us as provided in the  âContact Usâ section below. However, we reserve the right to send you  transactional emails such as customer service communications in connection with  the products or services you have purchased. For security reasons, we do not  recommend that you send personal information, such as passwords, social security  numbers, or bank account information, to us by email. <br>
  <u>Transfer of Assets</u>: We do not sell or lease  personal information or provide a list of our customers to third parties.  However, as we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase  assets. If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our  assets, the information we have about you will be transferred to and used by  this acquiring entity. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is  brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of  ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties. <br>
  <u>Legal Necessity</u>: Notwithstanding anything  herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any information about  you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright <br>
        and other intellectual  property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary  to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the  law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, or  our Site; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Siteâs  users or the general public. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What Choices Do You Have About Our Use  of Your Information? </strong><br>
        We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal  information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with  the following control over your information: <br>
        - Cookies. You can set your  browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are  being sent. <br>
        - Your Contact Information. If  you have previously emailed us and would like us to delete your contact  information from our files, please contact us at the email address below. <br>
        - Other Information. If at any point you believe the personal  information we hold about you is incorrect, you want us to correct or delete  that information, or you no longer want us to hold that information or contact  you, you can contact us at the email address below. </p>
      <p>You may have additional rights concerning your personal information  if you reside in the European Union. These can be found in the â<strong>European  Union Privacy Notice</strong>â section of this document. <br>
        <u>Accuracy of Personal Information</u>: It  is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and  current. Company requires you to keep us informed of changes to your personal  information. If your registration information changes, please send your request  to us at the email address below. We take reasonable steps to verify your  identity prior to honoring any such requests to help protect your privacy and  security. <br>
        <u>Accessing Your Personal Information</u>: If  you want to know what personal information Company holds about you or wish to  change personal information that is inaccurate or out of date, or to withdraw  your consent to our use of your personal information, please contact us at the  email address below. It may not always be possible to completely remove or  modify information in our databases, although we will make reasonable efforts  to do so upon your request. We do not control how our partners retain, store  and destroy data they have accessed in connection with assisting with providing  our services. You should check their websites for more information on their  practices. <br>
        <u>Do Not Track Disclosures</u>: Certain browsers may  offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for  your online activities to be tracked for preference-based advertising purposes  (âDNT Noticeâ). Some browsers are, by default, set to provide a DNT Notice,  whether or not that reflects your preference. Providing DNT Notice is often  touted as a means to ensure that cookies, web beacons and similar technology  are not used for preference-based advertising purposes â that is, to restrict  the collection of information your online activities for advertising purposes.  Unfortunately, given how preference-based advertising works, DNT Notices may  not effectively accomplish this goal. For this and a variety of other reasons,  with respect to our Site, we do not take any particular action based on browser  based DNT Notices. However, we do not use third-party advertisers or engage in  behavioral marketing data collection for resale. Rather, if you do not wish to  participate in preference-based advertising activities, you should follow the opt-out  process identified above. <br>
        <br>

        For purposes of the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR), personal data is any information that can identify you, either directly  or indirectly, such as a class='crucon_anchor' name, an identification number, your IP address, data  about your location, or information about your physical, physiological,  genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. <br>
  <strong>We are providing you this notice because we have collected  some of your personal data from you. We collect your data for a variety of  reasons, depending on whether you are an employee, a customer, an agent or a  vendor. </strong><strong> </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>What is the Legal Basis and Purpose for  Holding Your Personal Information? </strong><br>
  If you are a customer, an employee, or a job applicant, the  personal information we hold and use is necessary for the performance of the  services contract to which you are a party or to perform the services which you  have otherwise requested.  <br>
  If you are a prospective customer, the personal information  we collect and use is necessary for our legitimate interest in providing you  with information about the services we offer and about which you have expressed  an interest or that we believe will be of benefit to you.  <br>
  In some cases, our  legal basis for collecting your personal data is because you have expressly  consented to our collection and use of your personal information.  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data? </strong><br>
  If you are a customer, applicant for employment, vendor or  agent, we will keep your personal data on an ongoing basis for so long as we  have a legitimate interest to inform you of our services, or until our  contractual relationship has terminated, as the case may be. We are required to  retain certain information in accordance with the law, such as information  needed for income tax and audit purposes. How long certain kinds of personal  data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector  requirements and agreed practices.  <br>
