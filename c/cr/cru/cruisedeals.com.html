If another entity acquires us or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the information we have about you will be transferred to and used by this acquiring entity. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 20px"><i>Legal Necessity</i>: Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, or our Site; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Siteâs users or the general public.</p>
<h3>What Choices Do You Have About Our Use of Your Information?</h3>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.</li>
<li>Your Contact Information. If you have previously emailed us and would like us to delete your contact information from our files, please contact us at the email address below.</li>
<li>Other Information. If at any point you believe the personal information we hold about you is incorrect, you want us to correct or delete that information, or you no longer want us to hold that information or contact you, you can contact us at the email address below.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-top: 20px">You may have additional rights concerning your personal information if you reside in the European Union. These can be found in the â<strong>Europe</strong><strong>an Union Privacy Notice</strong>â section of this document.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 20px"><i>Accuracy of Personal Information</i>: It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current.&nbsp;Company&nbsp;requires you to keep us informed of changes to your personal information. If your registration information changes, please send your request to us at the email address below. We take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to honoring any such requests to help protect your privacy and security.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 20px"><i>Accessing Your Personal Information</i>: If you want to know what personal information&nbsp;Company&nbsp;holds about you or wish to change personal information that is inaccurate or out of date, or to withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information, please contact us at the email address below. It may not always be possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases, although we will make reasonable efforts to do so upon your request. We do not control how our partners retain, store and destroy data they have accessed in connection with assisting with providing our services. You should check their websites for more information on their practices.</p>
<p style="padding-top: 20px"><i>Do Not Track Disclosures</i>: Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference-based advertising purposes (âDNT Noticeâ). Some browsers are, by default, set to provide a DNT Notice, whether or not that reflects your preference. Providing DNT Notice is often touted as a means to ensure that cookies, web beacons and similar technology are not used for preference-based advertising purposes â that is, to restrict the collection of information your online activities for advertising purposes. Unfortunately, given how preference-based advertising works, DNT Notices may not effectively accomplish this goal. For this and a variety of other reasons, with respect to our Site, we do not take any particular action based on browser based DNT Notices. However, we do not use third-party advertisers or engage in behavioral marketing data collection for resale. Rather, if you do not wish to participate in preference-based advertising activities, you should follow the opt-out process identified above.</p>
