          We may use Data to customize and improve your user experience on this site. We will make efforts so that your Data

          your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if you
          purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your
          preference on our order form. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out

          to opt-out. You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service
          provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party ; (iii) a service
          provided on our site requires the interaction with or is provided by a third party, by way of example an Application Service

          or this site is purchased by a third party whereby that third party will be able to use the Data in the same manner as we can
          as set forth in this Policy. In the event you choose to use links that appear on our site to visit other web sites, you are
          advised to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites. We want you to be fully informed that we do not control
          these other Websites; hence this specific privacy policy is not applicable to these other Websites. As a result, these other
          Websites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may disclose that information differently. We suggest that
          you review their privacy policies and remind you that we at Crushspot.com will not be responsible for their actions. In the
          event of a transfer of ownership of Medmania, Inc., such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide
          notice before any personally identifiable information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
