  <h1>Crunchyroll Privacy Policy</h1>
  <br>Effective March 23rd, 2009<br><br>
  <p>
  Welcome to Crunchyroll! Crunchyroll, Inc. (“Crunchyroll”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use the www.crunchyroll.com site and any websites owned or operated by (or on behalf of) Crunchyroll (collectively, the “Sites”), and when you use our downloadable media player that enables users to view content (“Crunchyroll Player”) (collectively, the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Sites or offered by Crunchyroll through the Services.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Sites.  You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
  </p>


  <div class="sectionheader">Information Collection:  Personally Identifiable Information </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
    In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”).  Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses.  
    </li>
    <li>
    Please be aware that when you register to become a Crunchyroll member, other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post to the Sites or submit via the Services.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you.
    </li>
    <li>
    As you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to a website or online service (“Log Data”).  Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Sites and information you search for on a Site.  When a user downloads the Crunchyroll Player, we may record that a download took place.  When you launch the Crunchyroll Player on a website our servers may automatically record Log Data. When the Crunchyroll Player checks for new updates, it may also automatically send version number and operating system information to our servers. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Sites. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor web traffic routing on the Sites and aggregate usage of the Services.  You can instruct your browser,&nbsp;by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before&nbsp;accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Services.  
    </li>
    <li>
Third party advertisers on the Sites may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser, which permit them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. The collection and use of such information is subject to such third party’s privacy policy. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to these Sites  in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="sectionheader">Our Policy Toward Children</div>
  <p>
  Crunchyroll does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <script>writeEmail('priv','ac','y','crunchyroll','com');</script>.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

    <span class="sectiontitle">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</span>.  Crunchyroll cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Crunchyroll or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>

If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
