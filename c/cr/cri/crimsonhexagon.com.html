		             <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Crimson Hexagon, Inc. (“Crimson Hexagon,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users (“user”, “you” or “your”) of its website (“Site”). Crimson Hexagon’s Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and in making informed decisions when using our Site. This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices. This Privacy Policy applies to this Site and governs data collection and usage at this Site. The United States has data protection laws that may not be consistent with those of other countries. By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Please read it in its entirety.</p>
<h3>USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p>We may employ cookie technology to store and sometimes track information about the users of the Site. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related web pages. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent the browser from accepting cookies.</p>
<p>We may use web beacons (small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites) and auditing software to track page views and entry and exit points to and from the Site. In addition, we may use web beacons, cookies, customized links and/or similar technologies to determine whether electronic newsletters sent by us to those who have requested them from us have been opened and which links are clicked. Any data collected will only be used in an aggregate form and will not contain any Personal Information, as that term is defined below.</p>
<h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>Through the use of cookie technology or otherwise, we may track and collect information about your computer and software when you visit this Site. This information may include: (i) your IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of computer; (iv) type of web browser; (v) access times; and (vi) referring websites addresses (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you. Traffic Data assists us to design and arrange our web pages in the user-friendliest manner and to continually improve our Site to better meet the needs of users.</p>
<p>In order for you to access certain portions of our Site, we may require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, email address and home and/or business telephone numbers (“Personal Information”). If you communicate with us by email or otherwise complete online forms or the like, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.</p>
<p>You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site. You, however, will not be able to access or use those portions of the Site that require your Personal Information.</p>
<h3>USES AND SHARING OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (b) provide you the products and/or information that you may have requested; (c) protect our rights or property; (d) enforce our rights ; (e) protect the interest of users of the Site, other than you, or any other person; (f) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our equipment; and/or (g) detect, prevent and/or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, as authorized by law.</p>
<p>In general, we will use Personal Information only for the purpose for which such information was provided to us. We may also use Personal Information to contact you when necessary or to send you information about us, including information related to our services, products, programs or promotional activities. If you subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your email address to send the newsletter to you. You may opt-out of receiving future communications from Crimson Hexagon by following the instructions set forth in the opt-out section below.</p>
<p>We may share Personal Information with third parties that provide services to Crimson Hexagon (including handling and delivering of email communications and newsletter, and website hosting services) as reasonably necessary for them to provide said services. Service providers of Crimson Hexagon who have (or will have) access to Personal Information, however, are (or will be) required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and not to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Crimson Hexagon.</p>
<p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p>We may provide Traffic Data and/or other aggregate non-personally identifying information to third parties.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may transfer, sell or assign information concerning this Site and your use of this Site, including without limitation, Personal Information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Crimson Hexagon.</p>
<h3>OPT-OUT/DISCONTINUE</h3>
<p>If you do not wish to receive information or other material from us, you may “opt-out” of receiving these communications by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:remove@crimsonhexagon.com">remove@crimsonhexagon.com</a>.</p>

<h3><strong> SECURITY </strong></h3>
<p>The Site has security measures in place intended to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We will take reasonable steps to safeguard Personal Information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss or alteration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
