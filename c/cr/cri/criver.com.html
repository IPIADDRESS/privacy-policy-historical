                        <b>EU SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Charles River abides by the Safe Harbor Program’s data privacy principles
with respect to transfers of Personal Information between the United States and
member states of the European Economic Area.&nbsp; The privacy principles in
this policy are based on the Safe Harbor Program’s Principles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Notice</b>
                        <br>
Charles River may obtain Personal Information from data subjects through the
purposes identified above. At the time Charles River collects Personal
Information from you, it will inform you of the purposes for which it collects
and uses such information and how to contact Charles River with any inquiries
or complaints. Charles River will not disclose Personal Information to third
parties.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Choice</b>
                        <br>
Charles River will offer you the opportunity to choose whether your Personal
Information is to be (a) disclosed to a third party or (b) used for a purpose
that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected
or subsequently authorized by you.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Security</b>
                        <br>
Charles River will take reasonable precautions to protect your Personal
Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration
and destruction.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Data Integrity</b>
                        <br>
Charles River will not process your Personal Information in a way that is
incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently
authorized by you. To the extent necessary for those purposes, Charles River
will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant for
its intended use, accurate, complete and current.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Access</b>
                        <br>
Charles River will provide you with reasonable access to your Personal
Information that it holds and will undertake reasonable steps to permit you to
correct, amend or delete that information demonstrated to be inaccurate or
incomplete.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Transfer to Third Parties</b>
                        <br>
When Charles River transfers information to a third party that is acting as an
agent, before doing so it will ascertain that the third party either safeguards
Personal Information consistent with this policy, is subject to the EU
Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive, Safe Harbor certification
in the U.S by the third party, or by being subject to another European
Commission adequacy finding). Alternatively, Charles River may enter into a
written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide
at least the same level of privacy protection as required by the relevant
principles of this policy. Where Charles River has knowledge that an agent is
using or disclosing Personal Information contrary to this policy, Charles River
will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Enforcement</b>
                        <br>
Charles River will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices
to verify adherence to this policy. Any employee that Charles River determines
is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Dispute Resolution</b>
                        <br>
Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personal
Information should be directed to Jody Acford, the General Counsel in the Legal
Department, at &nbsp;<img src="http://www.criver.com/general/images/email_ja.jpg" border="0" align="bottom">&nbsp;or 978-658-6000
x.1631. Charles River will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints
regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the
principles contained in this policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved
between you and Charles River, Charles River has agreed to participate in the
dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European data
protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor
Program’s Principles.</p>

                        <i>Information Submitted Through the Website</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>In some areas of our Web site you are offered the opportunity to submit
Personal Information.</p>
                    <p>Medical investigators who have an interest in working with Charles River in
clinical studies may submit information to our Investigator Database.
Information gathered via the Investigator Database is shared with our clients
who are interested in conducting clinical studies in the therapeutic areas
described by the registering investigator.</p>
                    <p>Patients participating in any clinical study managed by Charles River, or
those acting on their behalf, who submit unsolicited information to a Web site,
including Personal Information, may expect that we will share that information
with our client who is responsible for the study, the medical investigator
supervising the patient’s participation in the study, the institutional review
board supervising the study and others who may have an interest in that
particular patient’s experience in the clinical study. If a patient sends an
unsolicited email to our Web site regarding a clinical study, we reserve the
right to use or disclose the information contained in the email to third
parties without seeking any additional consent from the patient.</p>
                    <p>Our Web site also contains forms for completion and submission, such as on
our Contact Us page and Career Opportunities page. Information submitted
<i>via</i> these forms will be used for the purposes described on the page
containing the form. You may expect that information submitted will be shared
with the appropriate Charles River employees and agents necessary to take
action on the information or request submitted. For example, resumes and
information related to those seeking employment will be shared with the staff
of the Charles River Human Resources Department and other Charles River
employees involved in the hiring process.</p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Information Security</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>Charles River takes every precaution to protect data subjects’ information,
whether collected on-line or otherwise. When data subjects submit sensitive
information <i>via</i> the Web site, their information is protected both online
and off-line.</p>
                    <p>When our order form asks data subjects to enter sensitive information (such
as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the
best encryption software in the industry: SSL. While on a secure page, such as
our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when data subjects are just 'surfing.’</p>
                    <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also
do everything in our power to protect data subject-information off-line. All of
our data subjects' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to
perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service
representative) are granted access to Personal Information. Finally, the
servers that store Personal Information are in a secure environment, in a
locked facility.</p>
                    <p>The Web site is not intended or designed to attract children. We do not
collect information or data on our Web site from children under the age of 13
nor do we desire to receive any information or data from children who visit our
Web site.</p>

                        <i>Updating Personal Information on the Website</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>If a data subject's Personal Information changes (such as zip code, phone,
email or postal address), we provide a way to correct and&nbsp;update data
subjects' Personal Information. This can usually be done by selecting
"Modify my account information" after logging in.</p>

                        <br>
Charles River will not transfer your Personal Information to third parties
without your consent, except under limited conditions. Though we make every
effort to preserve data subject privacy, we may need to disclose Personal
Information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such
action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order
or legal process served on our Web site. Charles River is a global company,
your Personal Information may be shared with other Charles River offices or
subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy
Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer
agreements. If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we will
only transfer that information with your permission.</p>

                        <br>
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing
company to bill data subjects for goods and services. These companies do not
retain, share, store or use Personal Information for any secondary
purposes.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
In the event Charles River goes through a business transition, such as a
merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets,
data subjects' Personal Information will, in most instances, be part of the
assets transferred. Data subjects will be notified via a notice on our Web site
prior to a change of ownership or control of their Personal Information. If as
a result of the business transition, the data subjects' Personal Information
will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection
they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes
section.</p>
