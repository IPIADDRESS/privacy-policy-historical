<h1>PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR CRITICAL HIT</h1>

<p>Critical Hit has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses
our information gathering and dissemination practices for this
website: Critical Hit (criticalhit.co.uk). We are committed to
protecting your privacy: we will only use the information that we
collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection
Act 1998) and will not sell, rent or loan third parties use of or
access to personal information such as your name or e-mail address.
Please read the following page for more details about our privacy
policy.</p>

<h3>What personal information may be collected and by what
means?</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>E-mail</strong><br>
We will only use any personal information (such as name, address,
and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your
specific inquiry or comments in the e-mail. Though we may retain
your e-mail for a period of time, we will not use any personal
information contained in your e-mail for any purpose other than
responding to your specific enquiry or comments.</li>

<li><strong>Forums</strong><br>
This site makes free interactive message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that
is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you
should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
information. Personal information of registered users is not
accessible by the public unless the member adds it to his or her
User Information or is disclosed by the user themselves in a public
post.</li>

<li><strong>Online Ordering</strong><br>
When you place an order, we need to know your name, e-mail
address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and the
card's expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your
order and to notify you of the status of your order. The
information we hold will be accurate and up to date. You can check
the information that we hold about you by e-mailing us. If you find
any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly. We do not
sell or share any of this information with third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we sometimes collect information to find out how
people found the site, which pages they visited, and how long they
stayed. This information does not include any personal information
about you. Some examples of this type of data collection are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, and
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP
addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
information.<br>
Our&nbsp; message boards may display IP addresses along with the
message poster's name, e-mail address, and message, but this
information is only available to administrators and moderators of
the forums.</li>

<li><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Cookies are pieces of information placed on your computer to help
personalize your visit to the site. For example, a cookie will
allow us to remember certain things about you, such as your login
name for our forums. Most major websites use cookies exactly for
this purpose. We cannot tell who you are or where you are with
cookies. The cookie only tells us that you have visited the site
before and may contain certain information that will help us make
your visit more enjoyable.<br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie
is being sent. However, some parts of our website will not function
properly if you refuse cookies. For example, you may have
difficulty completing shopping transactions, or using our
forums.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visitors should be aware that when you are on our site, you
could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For
example, if you visit a link,
you will leave our site. These other sites may send their own
cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal
information.</p>

<p>This site contains links to other sites. Critical Hit is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web
sites.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our usersâ€™
information.</p>

<p>When our order form asks you to enter sensitive information
(such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted.
While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes
locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just
'surfing'. Your credit card details are processed online by
our credit card processing company, <a href="http://www.worldpay.com">Worldpay</a>, in 'real
time'; transactions are encrypted using 128 bit Secure Socket
Layer (SSL) architecture. Your credit card details cannot be read
or tampered with during transmission. WorldPay uses state of the
art security tools and techniques, both proprietary and unique, to
ensure that you are protected against what is nowadays a virtually
non-existent risk.</p>

<h3>Correct/Update</h3>

<p>This site gives users the following options for changing and
modifying information previously provided.</p>

<ul>
<li>e-mail: webmaster@criticalhit.co.uk</li>

<li>Change information by clicking on the User CP icon on our Forums.</li>
