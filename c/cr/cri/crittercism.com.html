            <p>Last Updated: June 28, 2012</p>
            <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
            <p>Crittercism, Inc. takes your privacy seriously. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design
            and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy describes the
            collection of your personal information by Crittercism from our website located at http://www.crittercism.com,
            including without limitation all sub-domains thereof on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively,
            the "Site"). This Privacy Policy also describes our use and disclosure of such information. By accessing or
            using our Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the <a href="/tos-v3.html">Crittercism Terms of Service</a>
            and subject to the provisions of the Crittercism Terms of Service. The
            terms "Crittercism," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Crittercism, Inc. The terms "you" and "your" refer to the user
            accessing or using the Site.</p>
            <p>The term "personal information" as used in this Privacy Policy refers to personally identifiable information that
            specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual's first and last name, address, telephone number, e-
            mail address, credit card or other account number), and information about that individual or such individual's
            activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information.
            Personal information does not include "aggregate information" or other non-personally identifiable information.
            Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services, or users that is not
            personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may collect, use and disclose
            aggregate information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p>Via Registration, Site Products and Site Services:
                </p><blockquote>If you register for an account on the Site or otherwise register to access or use any Crittercism products or
                services available through the Site, the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information through
                such registration, access and use is further described in and governed by the Crittercism Terms of Service
                located at [insert link to Terms of Service].</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via Correspondence:
                </p><blockquote>If you contact us by e-mail, using a chat box or contact form on the Site, or by mail, fax, or other means, we
                collect the personal information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via E-mail Newsletters:
                </p><blockquote>We may offer e-mail newsletters from time to time on the Service, if you sign up to receive a newsletter from
                us, we collect your e-mail address.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via User Profiles:
                </p><blockquote>The Service may give you the ability to create and update a user profile on the Service. If we offer user profile
                functionality on the Service, we will collect the personal information that you provide to use in the course
                of creating or updating a user profile. This information may include, for example, name, postal address,
                telephone number, e-mail address, and related demographic information about you. We may indicate that
                some personal information is required to create the profile, while some is optional.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via Interactive Site Features and Public Site Areas:
                </p><blockquote>The Site may contain interactive functionality that allows you to engage with other users on the Site, to post
                comments to forums, to upload content ("User Materials"), to participate in surveys via the Site or e-mail, and
                otherwise to interact with the Site and with other users. If you use any interactive functionality on the Site
                that requests or permits you to provide us with personal information (including, for example, any features that
                allow you to post user materials on any of our services), we collect the personal information that you provide
                to us in the course of using these interactive features.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via Contests and Sweepstakes:
                </p><blockquote>We or our advertisers and other business partners may conduct or sponsor special contests, sweepstakes,
                and other promotions that users may enter or otherwise participate in on the Service. Certain of these
                promotions may be co-branded with one of our advertisers or other business partners. In these instances,
                the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the third-party partner on its website or other
                online service and may be shared with us. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the
                collection of such personal information.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via Passive Means Through the Site and Correspondence:
                </p><blockquote>When you visit our Site, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you access our
                Site, we automatically collect (a) your browser's Internet Protocol (IP) address, (b) your browser type, (c)
                the nature of the device from which you are visiting the Site (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device),
                (d) the identifier for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, (e) the website that you visited
                immediately prior to accessing our Site, (f) the actions you take on our Site, and (g) the content, features,
                and activities that you access and participate in on our Site. We also may collect information regarding your
                interaction with e-mail messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and
                clear GIFs (also known as "web beacons"). We may use information passively-collected from the Site to
                administer, operate, and improve the Site and our other programs, services, products, websites and other
                systems, to improve the effectiveness of advertising on the Service, and to provide advertisements and other
                content and Site experience that is tailored to you. If we link or associate any information gathered through
                passive means from the Site with your personal information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any
                information gathered through passive means from the Site as personal information, we treat the combined
                information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use and disclose information
                collected by passive means from the Site in aggregate form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Also, please be aware that third parties, such as companies displaying advertisements on the Service or
                sites, services and products provided by third parties ("Third-Party Sites") that may be linked to or otherwise
                made available through or on the Site, may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively
                collecting information about your use of their services, Third-Party Sites or content. We do not have access
                to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Via Other Sources:
                </p><blockquote>We may receive information about you, including personal information, from third parties (for example,
                Third-Party Sites that may provide chat box features on the Site), and we may combine this information with
                other personal information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy governs any combined
                information that we maintain in personally identifiable format.</blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p>We use personal information (a) to provide programs, services, products and information that you request;
            (b) to enhance, improve, operate, and maintain our programs, services, products, websites, and other
            systems; (c) to prevent fraudulent use of our programs, services, products, websites, and other systems; (d)
            to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in violation of our Terms of Use or applicable
            law; (e) to tailor advertisements, content, and other aspects of your experience on and in connection with the
            Site; (f) to maintain a record of our dealings with you; (g) for other administrative purposes; and (h) for any
            other purposes that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request your personal information, and
            pursuant to your consent.</p>
            <p>We may also use personal information you provide to contact you regarding products, services, and offers,
            both from ourselves and from third parties, that we believe you may find of interest. We allow you to opt-
            out from receiving marketing communications from us as described in the "Updating Your Information And
            Contact Preferences" section below.</p>
            <p><strong>HOW WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS</strong></p>
            <p>Except as described in this policy, Crittercism does not disclose or transfer personal information about you
            with other people unless we have your express permission.</p>
            <p>Protecting our Interests:
                </p><blockquote>We disclose personal information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect
                our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or
                property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Site and other users of the Site.</blockquote>

                providers), but only for their use to provide the requested service, or (c) to an acquirer, or successor or
                assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as
                well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which Personal Information is transferred
                to one or more third parties as one of our business assets. Crittercism requires its corporate affiliates that

            <p></p>
            <p><strong>THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</strong></p>
            <p>We suggest that when you link to or use any Third Party Site that you review that Third Party Site's privacy
            policy, as this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while using such
            Third-Party Site. Crittercism is not responsible for Third Party Sites, including without limitation their privacy
            policies. Our linking to or otherwise making available Third Party Sites does not constitute our sponsorship
            of, or affiliation with, those Third Party Sites.</p>
            <p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p>Crittercism uses reasonable efforts to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and
            unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee that your personal
            information will be absolutely protected. For example, your personal information may be affected by actions
            outside of our control, such as computer "hacking" and physical theft. You acknowledge that you provide your
            personal information at your own risk.</p>
            <p><strong>CHILD-SPECIFIC TERMS</strong></p>
            <p>Crittercism understands that children's privacy is important. The Site is not intended for use by children under
            13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of
            13 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not submit any personal
            information to Crittercism. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the
            age of 13 on our Site without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
            believe that we may have collected any such personal information on our Site, please notify us at privacy @
            crittercism.com.</p>
            <p><strong>INTERNATIONAL VISITORS</strong></p>
            <p>Our servers and data centers are located in the United States. If you choose to use the Site from outside the
            U.S., then you should know that you are transferring your personal information outside of your region and
            into the U.S. for storage and processing. By providing your personal information to us through your use of the
            Site, you agree to that transfer, storage, and processing in the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data from the
            U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests,
            and operating the Site. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws,
            some of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.</p>
            <p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
            <p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy on this page
            and will indicate at the top of the page the '"Last Updated" date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this
            page on an ongoing basis so that you are aware of our current privacy policy. Your continued use of the Site
            constitutes your agreement to the Privacy Policy as modified. If we change this Privacy Policy in a manner
            that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your personal information, we will use reasonable
            efforts to notify you of the change and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any personal
            information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.</p>
