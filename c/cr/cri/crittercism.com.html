		<h3>Crittercism Privacy Policy</h3>

		<p>Effective Date January 1, 2011
		</p>
		<p>OVERVIEW
		</p>
		<p>Crittercism, Inc. takes your privacy seriously. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the websites provided by Crittercism, including crittercism.com and other sites served from this domain (collectively "the Site").
		</p>
		<p>The term "personal information" as used in this Privacy Policy refers to personally identifiable information that specifically identifies an individual (such as an individual's first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number), and information about that individual or such individual's activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personally identifying information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or categories of Site users, from which any personal information has been removed. We may collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including to improve the Sites and the Services, to diagnose technical issues, to help identify user needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and to tailor existing products and services to better serve our users. This Privacy Policy in no way limits or restricts our collection, use or disclosure of aggregate information.

	    <p>HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
	    </p>
	    <p>At Registration:
	    </p>
	    <p>When you register with Crittercism, we may request some personal information, including your first and last name, an email address and password to create your account. We use registration information to manage your account and to provide you with the Crittercism Services. When you register as a member of Crittercism, you represent that you are providing complete and accurate information.
	    </p>
	    <p>Via Email:
	    </p>
	    <p>We place email links on the Sites to allow you to contact us directly. The information you provide, which may include personal information, is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the Sites and our Services, or review and discard the information.
	    </p>
	    <p>Via Software:
	    </p>
	    <p>Crittercism may obtain information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our software "agent" that may be embedded in an end user's mobile application. We aggregate that data, which tracks information such as use sessions, an end user's handset, or an end user's country. Once the data is aggregated, we make it available for analysis by the developer of the application.
	    </p>
	    <p>OTHER USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
	    </p>
	    <p>Crittercism may also use personal information collected from you for the following general purposes: (1) to fulfill your requests for Services; (2) to improve our Services; (3) to contact you to resolve problems; (4) to conduct research; and (5) to make the Sites easier to use by reducing the need for you to enter information.
	    </p>
	    <p>COOKIES
	    </p>
	    <p>In order to provide you with personalized service, Crittercism uses "cookies" to keep and occasionally track information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.
	    </p>
	    <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Sites. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your password if you choose "auto login", so you don't have to enter it more than once. We also store your display resolution and whether JavaScript is enabled in your browser to enhance the experience on the Sites. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's help file. However, removing cookies may not allow you to take full advantage of all features on the Sites.
	    </p>
	    <p>LINKS TO OTHER SITES
	    </p>
	    <p>Please note that, while using the Sites, you could be directed to other sites that are developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by Crittercism. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.
	    </p>
	    <p>We suggest that when you link to another site you review that site's privacy policy, as it may be different from this Privacy Policy. Crittercism is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Our link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.
	    </p>
	    <p>HOW WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS
	    </p>
	    <p>Except as described in this policy, Crittercism does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies unless we have your express permission, or under the following circumstances:
	    </p>
	    <p>When necessary to comply with law or legal process;
	    </p>
	    <p>To establish or exercise our rights or property, including defending against legal claims;
	    </p>
	    <p>When we believe it is necessary in order to protect our customers or users, including from misuse or unauthorized use of the Sites or our Services; or
	    </p>
	    <p>When we believe it is necessary to protect the safety or property of our employees, customers, users or others.
	    </p>
	    <p>Also, Crittercism may disclose or transfer your personal information (a) to its corporate affiliates (for example, a subsidiary or parent corporation), (b) to its service providers (like fulfillment, hosting, or payment service providers), but only for their use to provide the requested service, or (c) to an acquirer in connection with the sale or other transfer of the business or assets of Crittercism. Crittercism will require its corporate affiliates and service providers that receive your personal information to limit their use and disclosure of your information to the purposes for which you provided it.
	    </p>
	    <p>UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND CONTACT PREFERENCES
	    </p>
	    <p>We provide mechanisms for you to review and update your personal information through the Sites. If you wish to review or update your information, visit the Crittercism website (currently crittercism.com) and click "Login" or go directly to crittercism. If you wish to stop receiving marketing communications from us, you can opt out by replying to a message that we send you letting us know your preference to opt out. You also have the ability to opt out of receiving certain types of communications from us by visiting the Crittercism website (currently crittercism.com) and clicking "Login" or going directly to crittercism.
	    </p>
	    <p>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
	    </p>
	    <p>Crittercism uses reasonable efforts to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee that your personal information will be absolutely protected. For example, your personal information may be affected by actions outside of our control, such as computer "hacking" and physical theft. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.
	    </p>
	    <p>CHILD-SPECIFIC TERMS
	    </p>
	    <p>Crittercism understands that children's privacy is important. The Sites and our Services are not intended for use by children under 13 years old, and we do not intend to collect any personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13 years old, do not submit any personal information to Crittercism.
	    </p>
	    <p>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
	    </p>
	    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of the page the modified policy's effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this page on an ongoing basis so that you are aware of our current privacy policy. Your continued use of the Services or the Sites constitutes your agreement to the Privacy Policy as modified.
