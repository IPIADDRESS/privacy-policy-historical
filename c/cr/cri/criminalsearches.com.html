                This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to the CriminalSearches.com web site (the “Site”). We understand and respect your concerns about privacy and the security of personal information, and we want you to feel comfortable using our Site. Maintaining the security of your personally identifiable information is important to us, as is giving you choices as to how that information is used and shared. We've created this Policy to provide you with information about data security and the privacy practices and policies applicable to the Site. This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use (“Terms”). By clicking your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use during the registration process on the Site you are entering into a legally binding agreement with CriminalSearches.com based upon the terms of these policies.  Each time that you access CriminalSearches.com Applications or our Services you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy, acknowledge that we are not providing you with a consumer report, and agree that you will not use the information obtained from us for any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.).

              <h3><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong></h3>
              
              <p>
                The Site may collect general information, which refers to data that is generally not tied back to a specific individual. Unlike general information, personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and email address, which may be collected in addition to the general data described above as provided below.
              </p>

              <p>The general information we collect (either directly or through the use of a third-party tracking system) includes:</p>

              <ul class="fixed">
                <li>The IP address of the computer making the request (usually
                  this is not your personal computer, but a computer used by
                  your internet service provider or company network) </li>
                <li>The URL that is being requested </li>
                <li>The date and time of the request </li>
                <li>The browser type and operating system used to make the request </li>
                <li>The referring URL </li>
              </ul>
 
              <br>  

              <p>
              We also may collect aggregate search terms from search engine referrals to determine what information visitors are searching for when they find our Site. All of this general information is used to administer and improve our Site and diagnose any technical problems which may occur with our servers.
              </p>

              <p>
              You have the option of creating an account with us in order to receive certain email (“Account”). In the event you create an Account, the Site may collect personal information by email or via our contact forms. Unless you give your consent, this information will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.  
              </p>
   
            <p>              
                <b>Registration Information.</b>  We will collect personal information from you if you register with us or subscribe to our Services ("Personal Information").  Any information you provide before registering with us is not associated with you individually and is not retained by CriminalSearches.com unless you register with us. When you register you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, billing information and a password. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Searching for records.</b>  When you are searching for records, you may enter third party personal information such as their name, address or phone. We only use the data you input to provide you with a search request.  We retain the results of your search requests for a period of time at our discretion but do not use that information for any other purpose and have no obligation to maintain such search results.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Optional Information.</b>  At various other points during your visit to CriminalSearches.com, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part.  You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our CriminalSearches.com Applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Billing Information.</b>  While many products and services on our Site are provided free, some require payment from you by credit/debit card (“Billing Information”).  We collect, and if you are purchasing a recurring billing subscription, we store Billing Information but this information is only shared with third parties who perform tasks required to verify and complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit/debit cards.  
            </p>

              <p><b><u>Information Collected Through Technology and Advertising </u></b></p>
              
              <p>
                In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the CriminalSearches.com Applications (“Usage Information”), including the device used to access CriminalSearches.com Applications (“Device”), and the IP address or other unique identifier identified by that Device (“Device Identifier”).  Your Device Identifier may also identify your regional location.  This Usage Information is used for many purposes including, for example, to: 
              
                  </p><ul class="fixed">
                    <li>Provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to CriminalSearches.com Applications; for example, remembering the searches you conducted</li>

                    <li>Monitor and evaluate the use and operation of our CriminalSearches.com Applications</li>

                    <li>We may associate this tracking data with your registration account, in which case we will treat it as personal information.</li>
                  </ul>
              
              <p></p>
              
              <p>
                Third party service providers might combine information they collect from your interaction with CriminalSearches.com Applications with personal information they collect from other sources.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of tracking technologies.  Service providers that collect tracking data on our behalf may provide an opportunity for you to choose not to be tracked online. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the CriminalSearches.com Applications may not function properly.  For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into our CriminalSearches.com Applications.

              <p><b><u>Information We Collect From Third Parties</u></b></p>
              
              <p>
              We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address, your billing information, or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

              <p>
                <b>Use of Information by Us.</b>  We may use Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to provide you with information regarding new features, products or services; (3) to improve the CriminalSearches.com Applications or our Services and to customize your experience; (4) to contact you with regard to your use of the CriminalSearches.com Applications and, in our discretion, changes to the CriminalSearches.com Applications and/or the CriminalSearches.com Applications’ policies; (5) for internal business purposes; (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, and (7) as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. 
              </p>
              
              <p>
              In general, we will not share your email address with any third party. However, if you specifically authorize us to provide your email address to a third party, we may do so in accordance with your instructions. We do not share any of your personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. However, we may disclose any of the information we collect to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and companies that are related to us by common ownership or affiliated with us by common control. 
              </p>
              

              <p>
                If we are acquired by or merge with another company, information will be transferred to the acquiring company. We may also share information to the extent we believe it is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., in response to subpoenas or government investigations), to assert or defend legal claims, and in order to investigate or respond to actual or suspected illegal activities, fraud, and threats of physical harm.
              </p>
                
                

              <h3><strong>Your Right to Choose</strong></h3>
              
              <p>You have the ability to opt-out of certain types of information
                sharing and communications. You may opt-out of certain communications
                if you prefer that we not send you newsletters or other communications.
                If you exercise this opt-out right, we will not send you any
                further newsletters or other communications. If you receive an
                email from us you may exercise your right to opt-out of further
                email communications by following the opt-out link contained
                in our email.</p>

              <h3><strong>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</strong></h3>
              
              <p>If our Site contains links to other sites, we are not responsible
                for the privacy practices or content of those other sites. We
                sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions) that is sponsored
                by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of
                these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally
                identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to
                participate in the site activity. We have no control over these
                third parties' use of this information. We will notify you at
                the time of requesting personally identifiable information if
                we will be providing this information to third parties.</p>

              <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
              <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by
                a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so the information
                can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the
                browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server
                to maintain an active "session" with an individual
                user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information.
                We make limited use of cookies to make your visit to the Site
                easier, to improve the user experience and to identify individual
                users who have an Account with us. We also use a third-party
                tracking service that uses cookies to gather statistical information
                about how our Site is used. This statistical information is not
                connected to any of your personal information.</p>

              <h3><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></h3>
              
              <p>
              The CriminalSearches.com Applications are intended for a general audience and are not directed or intended for children under 18 years of age.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 18 years of age.  If you are under 18 years of age, you should not register or provide Personal Information on the CriminalSearches.com Applications.  If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our systems. 
              </p>

              <h3><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
              <p>
                We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on our Site, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy.  We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new CriminalSearches.com Applications or Community Services or change existing ones.  If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your Personal Information, you will know because the Effective Date of the Privacy Policy will change.  If we are going to use any Personal Information in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change.

                The data on this site provides only public record information and is intended
                for your personal use only. Our data should not be relied upon to determine an
                individual's actual criminal record since the offense listed is sometimes
                generic and could represent several different charges. Assumptions should NOT
                be made solely on the offense displayed on this web site. Our data includes
                more than criminal records, such as civil filings and traffic and other minor
                offenses, so people listed may not be actual criminals. Also, not all criminal
                records result in conviction, nor do they all provide dispositions of guilt or
                innocence. Expunged or sealed records will be removed from the site once we
                receive notice of the same from you. In order to provide you the most
                comprehensive search experience, from time to time we may buy data from private
                data providers. Charging decisions made by the State Attorney's Office or from
                the outcome of criminal trials should be obtained from the source.
