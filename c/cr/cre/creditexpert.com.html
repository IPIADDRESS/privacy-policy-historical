<br><br>
<span class="par-title-txt"><b>DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</b></span>
<br>
<b>We do not share information with any non-affiliated third party</b> except: (1) in select circumstances when a business partner refers you to us and you give us permission to share specific information, such as your name and email address, with that business partner on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by law, such as inquires by law enforcement or to comply with Federal laws such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) or the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA).<br> 
If you choose, we may disclose the information that we collect to our affiliated companies from time to time for marketing purposes and to enhance our products and services to better suit your needs.  When identifying methods of improving our products and services or if we think a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend select special offers of goods or services to you either directly or through affiliates.   If you would like to opt-out of having your information shared with partners and/or affiliates, please refer to the section labeled “Offering You Choices - Marketing Options,” below.<br>
