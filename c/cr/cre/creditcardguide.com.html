<b><em>Disclosure  of Personally Identifiable Information </em></b>
<br><br>
<p><u>Typical Disclosure </u> </p>
We may disclose personally identifiable  information:<br>
<ul>
<li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive  your personally identifiable information as your agent, including as a result  of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
<li>To our third party vendors so that they may provide support for our  internal and business operations, including for the handling of data  processing, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of  promotional and transaction materials, and this Site's maintenance and  security;</li>
<li>To third parties when you (i) engage in certain activities on this Site  that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by  a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third  party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other  programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, and/or (ii) respond to  promotional materials from us and you authorize a third party to use your  personally identifiable information to, for example, send you additional  promotional materials, provide you a product or service, or enter you into a  sweepstakes.  When we disclose your  personally identifiable information to these third parties, your personally  identifiable information will become permanently subject to the information use  and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be  restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing  of your personally identifiable information;</li>

<li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative  agency;</li>

<li>As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are  violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering  with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or  property;
If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or  instance of local, regional or national emergency; </li>


<li>To enforce our <a href="/disclaimer.html">Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable  agreements and policies;</li>

<li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>

<li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <em><a href="#pos1">Business Transfers</a></em> below);  and </li>

<li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or  management with us).  </li>
</ul>

<u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u> <br>

<p>We may take your personally identifiable information and make it  non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about  other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other  individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the  information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your  information).  We may use and/or disclose  to third parties such aggregate or de-personalized information in any manner  and without notice or compensation to you.</p>
<br>
<u>Requests  for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</u><br>
<p>Certain portions of this  Site may allow you to request a quote, services or information from one or more  third parties, such as insurance providers ("Requested Service  Providers").  If you provide your  personally identifiable information on the Site and request a quote, services  or information from Requested Service Providers (e.g., by clicking  "Submit" or "get your quotes") (a "Request"), we may share,  loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, Requested  Service Providers that we match with your Request, your current provider, or to  other third parties that may match you with a Requested Service Provider.  In addition, the Requested Service Providers  and such third may further disclose, share and use any personally identifiable  information provided by you in connection with your Request.  If you make a Request, you expressly consent  to such disclosure and use of your personally identifiable information.  <strong>If you do not want your personally  identifiable information shared as described above, then you should not submit  a Request.  </strong> </p>
<br>
<p><strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE  PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA TELEPHONE, FAX, AND  EMAIL.  YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING  CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON  THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.  </strong></p>
<br>
<p>If you are  matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested  Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes  for your Request.  Requested Service  Providers may need to share your personally identifiable information to conduct  such research.  As an example, if you  request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with  your insurance application.  Such reports  may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for  insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance.  Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of  this insurance.  In addition, insurance  companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a  "insurance score" for you.  <strong>If  you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to  provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</strong>.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Please  note that if you submit a Request on this Site and we share your information as  described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity  to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with that  Request.</strong></p>

<br>
<u>Sweepstakes</u> <br>
<p>If  you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we  reserve the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the information that you submit  with and to our affiliates and other third parties.  Please refer to the official  rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific  policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes  entry. </p>

<br>
<u>Circumvention of Security Measures</u> <br>

<p>In addition, although we use reasonable security measures to protect the  personally identifiable information we collect through this Site, we cannot  ensure that your personally identifiable information will only be disclosed as  described in this Privacy Policy.  By way  of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose  personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under  certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access  transmissions or private communications.   Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy  Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, <u>you use this  Site at your own risk</u> and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should  not expect, that your personally identifiable information will always remain  private.  In the unlikely event that an  unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible  for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party's  ability to view, use or disseminate such information.</p>

<br>
<u>Business Transfers</u> <a name="pos1" id="pos1">&nbsp;</a><br>
<p>We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease,  sell, assign or transfer your personally identifiable information collected  through this Site, and any of its databases, together with any personally  identifiable information contained in such data bases, to third parties in  connection with a Business Transfer.  A  "Business Transfer" means a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation,  reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our  affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and  regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our  business.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy  is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our  business, equity, and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or  independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation,  without notice, any without any compensation to you, whatsoever.</p>

<br>
<p><strong><em>Network  Advertising</em></strong></p>

<p>From time to time, we may  participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising  servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms.  We may use these third-party advertising  networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to  serve advertisements to you.  Advertising  networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make  inferences about a consumer's interests and preferences, which enables their  computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer's  specific interests.  This practice is  often referred to as "online behavioral advertising."  For example, a third-party advertising network  might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer  operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or  not you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of  your Internet service provider's presence, the date and time of a visit to a  website and other interactions between you and website.  Please see the "Online Behavioral  Advertising" subsection of <a href="#pos3">Choices About How We Use  and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you can prevent  certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>

<br>

We cannot control the actions of other users  of this Site with whom you may choose to share your User Generated  Content.
