	<br>
	<em>Last updated: November 6, 2013</em> <br>
	<br>
	This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information when you use our Services. The terms “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Bankrate, Inc. , a Delaware corporation, and its legal subsidiaries and affiliates. The term “Services,” means, collectively, various websites, applications, widgets, email notifications and other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of Your Information (collectively, “Use of Your Information”) as described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
	<br>
	For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about you, which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information, medical and health history information, and/or financial information. <br>
	<br>
	This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of you using our Services, and does not apply to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Information collected through mediums other than our Services;</li>
	<li>
		Information collected through our Services where a separate privacy policy applies, such as a sweepstakes entry (you should refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or</li>
	<li>
		Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or lead form).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br>
	In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our <a href="http://www.creditcardguide.com/disclaimer.html">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://www.creditcardguide.com/disclaimer.html">Terms of Use</a>. These documents describe information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the <a href="http://www.creditcardguide.com/disclaimer.html ">Terms of Use</a> carefully. <br>
	<br>
	<strong><em>Information We Collect and Receive About You </em></strong> <br>
	<br>
	We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the information described below. <br>
	<br>
	<u>Information You Provide</u> <br>
	<br>
	The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;</li>
	<li>
		When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;</li>
	<li>
		When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or website;</li>
	<li>
		When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via email or other means;</li>
	<li>
		When you participate in online surveys;</li>
	<li>
		When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; and</li>
	<li>
		When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br>
	<u>Information Third Parties Provide</u><br>
	<br>
	We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites (i.e. , Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners. <br>
	<br>
	<u>General Use and Preference Information</u><br>
	<br>
	We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences. <br>
	<br>
	<u>Device Information</u><br>
	<br>
	When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time. In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service. We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches. <br>
	<br>
	<u>Location Information</u><br>
	<br>
	If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates. We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties. <br>
	<u><br>
	Phone Numbers</u><br>
	<br>
	We may collect your phone number in several ways. For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone <br>
	number to us. <br>
	<u><br>
	Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</u><br>
	<br>
	We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device. “Cookies” are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with cookies. Other “anonymous identifiers” are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available. These technologies help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services. <br>
	<br>
	The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information (i.e. , information that can identify you). If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information. <br>
	<br>
	Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services. <br>
	<br>
	The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy.

	<strong>If you do not want Your Information Shared as described above, then you should not provide us with your information.</strong> <br>
	<br>
	<u>Reguests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</u> <br>
	<br>
	As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a "Request"). <strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.</strong> <br>
	<br>
	If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request. Requested Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research. As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application. Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance. In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a “insurance score” for you. <strong>If you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</strong>. <br>
	<br>
	<strong> Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request. </strong><br>
	<br>
	<u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u><br>
	<br>
	We may take Your Information and de-indentify it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information). We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you. <br>
	<br>
	<u>Sharing with Friends</u> <br>
	<br>
	If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. <u><br>
	<br>
	Sweepstakes</u> <br>
	<br>
	If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information.

No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

A “Business Transfer” means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you. <br>

	Network Advertising</em></strong> <br>
	<br>
	From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising. ”For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet service provider’s presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website. Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection of <a href="#choices">Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you. <br>
