<h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
<p>Last Updated: September 15, 2009</p>

<p>CreateSpace knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully 
and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. <strong>By visiting CreateSpace, you are accepting the practices described in this 
Privacy Notice.</strong> As used herein, "you" and "customers" mean all visitors to this site, including customers, members (such as 
authors, musicians, filmmakers, and other artists), and publishers.</p>

<a name="PersonalInformation"></a>
<h2>What Personal Information About Customers Does CreateSpace Gather?</h2>
<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at CreateSpace. Here are the types 
of information we gather. </p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong><br> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other 
way. <a href="#Examples">Click here</a> to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take 
advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future 
shopping and other features for you, improving our site, and communicating with you.</li>
   <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong><br> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, 
like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses CreateSpace. <a href="#Examples">Click here</a> to see 
examples of the information we receive.</li>
   <li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong><br> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you 
open e-mail from CreateSpace if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, 
in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive promotional e-mail from us, please update your 
account information or otherwise let us know.</li>
   <li><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong><br> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account 
information.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Cookies"></a>
<h2>What About Cookies?</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize 
your browser and to provide features such as personalized greetings and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. </li>
   <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser 
notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser 
add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take 
full advantage of some of CreateSpace's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. </li>
</ul>

<a name="Sharing"></a>
<h2>Does CreateSpace Share the Information It Receives?</h2>
<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer 
information only as described below and with our parent corporation, Amazon.com, Inc., and the subsidiaries it controls. </p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong><br> We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, we will include 
offerings directly from those businesses on CreateSpace. In other cases, we may include joint offerings from CreateSpace and these businesses on CreateSpace. 
You can tell when a third party is involved in the offering, and we share customer information related to those offerings with that business. </li>
   <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong><br> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include 
fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing
 assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have 
access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
   <li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong><br> Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of CreateSpace customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do 
this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please update your account information.</li>
   <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong><br> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such 
transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice 
(unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that CreateSpace or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li> 
   <li><strong>Protection of CreateSpace and Others:</strong><br> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to 
comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.createspace.com/Help/Rights/TermsOfUse.jsp;jsessionid=C3928C37D05C7698675D26CA2572F10B.9ff317a4ad5bb4b1512e999ba37a5f46">Terms of Use</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of CreateSpace, our users, or others. 
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not 
include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments 
set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li> 
   <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong><br> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you 
will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li> 
</ul>

<a name="Secure"></a>
<h2>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>
<ul>
   <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. </li>
   <li>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate 
credit card company during order processing. </li>
   <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. </li>
</ul>

<a name="ThirdParties"></a>
<h2>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h2>
<p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or 
third-party websites. </p>
<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements 
that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons 
(also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have 
access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this 
Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a> offers useful information 
about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection. </p>
<p>CreateSpace may also display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although CreateSpace does not provide any personal information to advertisers, 
advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad 
(for example, users in the northwestern United States who like classical music).</p>

<a name="Access"></a>
<h2>Which Information Can I Access?</h2>
<p>CreateSpace gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with CreateSpace for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain 
cases, updating that information. To access account information, visit <a href="https://www.createspace.com/Member/Dashboard.do;jsessionid=C3928C37D05C7698675D26CA2572F10B.9ff317a4ad5bb4b1512e999ba37a5f46">My Account</a>.</p>

<a name="Choices"></a>
<h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>
