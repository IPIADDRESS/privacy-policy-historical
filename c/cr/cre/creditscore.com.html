            Additionally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally
            identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals or
            by removing items such as your name or address that make the resulting information
            personally identifiable to you. Once information is de-personalized in this manner,
            there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon our rights to aggregate
            or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and/or share the resulting
            non-personally identifiable information with third-parties in any manner.</p>
        <h3>
            Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>
            Personally identifiable information refers to information that can be linked to
            a specific individual. We collect your personal information only if you decide to
            register for, log on, or visit our web sites, purchase one of our products or services,
            participate in a free trial or other promotional program, participate in our affiliate
            program, subscribe to our newsletter, participate in one or more of our contests
            or surveys, request further information related to promotional offers on our site,
            or transact other business with us. Personally identifiable information may be collected
            on applications, forms and in correspondence (written or oral). Personally identifiable
            information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name (first and last)</li>
            <li>Address (current and previous home and/or billing)</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Telephone numbers</li>
            <li>Social Security number</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Employment information</li>
            <li>Credit card information</li>
            <li>Information in your credit report (used to verify identity)</li>
            <li>At times, we may also use IP addresses to collect information regarding visits to
                various parts of our web sites</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In general, personally identifiable information is used for the purpose for which
            you provide it. Certain services offered through us cannot be provided without personally
            identifiable information. Specifically, personally identifiable information is used
            to verify the identity of the one requesting access to a credit report to ensure
            that no one else has access to your credit report.</p>
        <p>
            Our web sites may also use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes,
            including tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are small pieces of data that are embedded
            in images on the pages of web sites. These technical methods are used to analyze
            the traffic patterns on our web sites, such as how often our users visit various
            parts of our web sites. These technical methods may involve the communication of
            information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect
            information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in HTML emails
            that we send our visitors to determine whether they have opened those emails and/or
            clicked on links in those emails. The information obtained from the use of these
            technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>
        <h3>
            How We Share Your Information</h3>
        <p>
            When you order a product or service through us, we must share some of your personally
            identifiable information with third-parties in order to fulfill your order. We cannot,
            for example, retrieve your credit report or credit score without sharing your personal
            information with the provider of that service. We cannot process your order payment
            without sharing personal information with our credit card payment processor. These
            third-parties are not permitted to use your personal information for any purpose
            other than to provide the requested service.</p>
        <p>
            We may also share your information with affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties
            to offer products or services that may be of interest or benefit to our customers.
            If you prefer not to receive such offers, you may indicate your preference when
            you place an order, when you receive such an offer or by updating your account information.</p>
        <p>
            Additionally, if you choose, we may disclose information that is collected about
            you to our affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties for purposes of marketing
            and to provide you with offers as to products we feel may be in furtherance of your
            interest. To the extent that you express interest in certain products or categories
            of products, we may also provide you with the opportunity to obtain additional information
            and offers as to those products. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you
            may opt-out. New members may opt-out during initial enrollment and existing members
            must contact us directly to opt-out. Please note that we cannot be responsible for
            the privacy policies of any web site, or vendor other than ourselves.</p>
        <p>
            We may also disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that
            such disclosures are required by law, or will help to: enforce our Terms of Use;
            enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety
            or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you;
            and/or, protect the safety and security of our web sites, our company(ies), and/or
            third-parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to us
            or third-parties.</p>

            Security</h3>
        <p>
            We maintain strict physical, technical and administrative standards to protect the
            personal information we collect and use to provide our services. Information is
            encrypted and transmitted via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Pages which use this
            technology can be identified by "https" at the beginning of the URL. Additional
            procedures are in place to protect your information from unauthorized access. This
            includes, but is not limited to, internal and external firewalls and physical security
            of the premises.</p>
        <p>
            Consumers who use our web sites and services can further enhance the security of
            their information by following reasonable personal security measures. This would
            include safeguarding your password and not leaving your information on an unattended
            computer.</p>

            Notification of Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time, but will notify users in advance of
            any material change, by posting a notice of the change in a prominent position on
            the home page of the our web site. If the amendment would permit us to share your
            personal information with third-parties in a manner materially different than described
            in this Privacy Statement, unless required by law or court order or in order to
            safeguard the operations of our site or our customers, you will be given an opportunity
            to inform us that you do not consent to such sharing of your personal information.</p>
        <h3>
            Possible Merger or Acquisition</h3>
        <p>
            In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
            by another company, or sale or disposal of all or a portion of our assets, your
            personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.
            The acquirer's privacy policy might be different than our privacy policy or the
            acquirer might choose to amend our privacy policy. You will be notified by means
            of notice on our sites for thirty (30) days of any such change in ownership or control
            of your personal information. For more information, please refer to the section
