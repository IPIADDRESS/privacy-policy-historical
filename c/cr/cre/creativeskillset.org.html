<h2>Privacy policy for Creative Skillset</h2>
<p>This statement covers the website <a href="http://www.creativeskillset.org" title="Creative Skillset website">www.creativeskillset.org</a>, its sub-sites and all other websites owned and operated by Creative Skillset. Creative Skillset is fully committed to protecting your personal information and conducts all its business in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 our data controller is&nbsp;Ryan Bright, Systems Analyst, available at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ryanb@creativeskillset.org" class="popup">ryanb@creativeskillset.org</a>.</p>

</ol>
<p>This statement explains how Creative Skillset gathers information from you and how this information is then used. We do update this Policy from time to time so please do review this Policy regularly.</p>
<h3>1. Collection of your personal information</h3>
<p>In operating our website we may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<p>1.1 Details of your visits to our website and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data.</p>
<p>1.2 Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website, such as when you registered for information or make a purchase, or when you apply for a training programme delivered by us or one of our partners.</p>
<p>1.3 Information provided to us when you communicate with us for any reason.</p>
<p>Personal information collected by Creative Skillset is often limited to contact details and some basic information about your area of work and employment status, but may include other information necessary to provide a particular service you have requested.</p>
<p>Sensitive data may include data about your ethnic origin, nationality, gender, membership of a trade union or association, employment status, sexual orientation, caring responsibilities, number of children and, in some cases, your socio-economic background.</p>
<p>If you are applying for a service for which government funding is available, you may need to answer certain additional questions such as your age and your current education and employment status, in order for us to evaluate whether you are eligible for that funding. By providing your information to Creative Skillset, you explicitly give your consent for us to process your personal and sensitive data. However, when we collect sensitive personal data through this site, we will ask you to consent to our uses of the data, and you may choose not to give us this consent if you so desire. Wherever the provision of information is optional, this will be made clear. You will need to provide personal data when:</p>
<ul>
<li>you register on this site to access additional online products and services;</li>
<li>you wish to subscribe to Creative Skillset mail outs and e-newsletters;</li>
<li>you provide us with feedback about our services or comment on our website(s);</li>
<li>you complete an application form for our services online;</li>
<li>you request further information or advice through our website(s);</li>
<li>you send us a letter or e-mail requiring information or dialogue;</li>
<li>you call one of our helplines asking for advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if you are aged 16 or under, you will need to get your parents' permission before providing us with your personal information.</p>
<h3>2. Cookies and user tracking</h3>
<p>Please see the Creative Skillset Cookie Policy above.</p>
<h3>3. How we use your information</h3>
<p>The information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily used to enable us to provide our services to you. In addition, we may use the information for the following purposes:</p>
<p>3.1 To provide you with information requested from us, relating to our products or services. To provide information on other products which we feel may be of interest to you, where you have consented to receive such information.</p>
<p>3.2 To meet our contractual commitments to you.</p>
<p>3.3 To notify you about any changes to our website, such as improvements or service/product changes, that may affect our service.</p>
<p>3.4 To deal with your comment or query, and to contact you for more information regarding a comment or query you have made.</p>
<p>3.5 To arrange and deliver services you have requested, whether online, one-to-one or via the telephone.</p>
<p>3.6 To deliver specific information you have requested, such as event invitations, careers information, publications, e-newsletters and press releases.</p>
<p>3.7 To deliver more general information on an ongoing basis, such as promotional materials and general updates relevant to you on Creative Skillset's activities and those of our partner organisations, if you so request.</p>
<p>3.8 To contextualise comments you have made and analyse the results of online and e-mail consultations and surveys, as part of our ongoing research activities.</p>
<p>3.9 To generate anonymous statistics to help us improve the services we offer to you (these statistics will not include information that can identify you as an individual).&nbsp;Sometimes we may ask you whether we can keep personal sensitive data linked to an individual learning record. This can happen when we want to monitor the progress of individuals from different backgrounds through and beyond a training programme. It may also occur when we are required to share you data with a funding organisation (like the Skills Funding Agency) or a training provider partner. Giving personal sensitive information is always voluntary and we will explicitly ask your permission to share it, and any reported statistics based on it will still be anonymous.</p>
<p>3.10 To ensure that the Equal Opportunities Policy is effective, a monitoring of applications, approvals and placements&nbsp;is carried out. The collected sensitive information regarding your gender, age, ethnic group, sexual orientation, caring responsibilities and in some cases socio-economic background,&nbsp;and any disability you may have, is used solely for monitoring purposes and will be treated as confidential.</p>
<p>3.11 To pre-populate forms on our website requesting information you have already provided, for your convenience and ease-of-use.</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer, we may contact you with information about products and services similar to those which were the subject of previous correspondence with you.</p>
<p>If you are a new customer, we will only contact you when you have provided consent and only by those means you provided consent for.</p>
<h3>4. Storing your personal data</h3>
<p>4.1 Data that is provided to us is stored on our secure servers.</p>
<p>4.2 The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.</p>
<p>4.3 We store application details including personal, sensitive data in electronic forms which are filed on our secure intranet. Hard copies of application forms are stored in lockable cabinets in a secure office environment.<br><br>4.4 Administrators and the project manager will have access to data given in application forms, as they record and collate it, but any statistics used in reports on the level of take-up or progress of participants in training are calculated, stored and shared anonymously.</p>
<h3>5.Disclosing and sharing your information</h3>
<p>We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except where the data may be provided to a third party company, such as a mailing house or web agency, for the sole purpose of delivering a service on Creative Skillset's behalf.</p>
<p>Your personal data - your name address, contact details etc. - will only be shared with partners or funders connected by contract with the training opportunity you have applied for. Where we need to share it with a specific organisation, e.g. the Skills Funding Agency, we will ask your permission to do so.<br><br>Your sensitive data, concerning characteristics such as your gender, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation is always asked for on a voluntary basis - you can prefer not to say - and diversity statistics gathered through our monitoring systems are always reported anonymously.</p>
<h3>6. Course information and third party links</h3>
<p>Creative Skillset has taken care to ensure that the information on the website is correct. However, no warranty, express or implied, is given as to its accuracy and Creative Skillset does not accept any liability for error or omission. Creative Skillset is not responsible for how the information is used, how it is interpreted or what reliance is placed on it. We do not guarantee that the information on the website is fit for any particular purpose. You should also be aware that the availability of courses of study is subject to conditions applied by individual institutions at their sole discretion.</p>
<p>The website includes links to external websites. These links are provided to help you find additional information quickly and easily. Creative Skillset accepts no responsibility for the content of these websites and specifically all liability that may arise with respect to or as a result of such material causing damage, costs, injury or financial loss of any kind. Creative Skillset cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide whilst visiting these websites.</p>
<p>You will find links to third party websites on our website. These websites should have their own privacy policies which you should check. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies whatsoever as we have no control over them. Creative Skillset does not endorse any of the products or services of third party organisations contained within its sites unless expressly stated.</p>
<h3>7. Access to information</h3>
<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to know whether we hold information about you, and also to access that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. To request access to your information, or if you wish to be removed from our database at any time, please contact Ryan Bright, Systems Analyst at <a href="mailto:ryanb@creativeskillset.org" class="popup">ryanb@creativeskillset.org</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone subscribing to receive information from Creative Skillset can unsubscribe from receiving such information at any time, either by following the unsubscribe instructions sent with all electronic communications, or by e-mailing <a href="mailto:ryanb@creativeskillset.org" class="popup">ryanb@creativeskillset.org</a></p>
<h3>8. Freedom of information</h3>
<p>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 provides public access to information held by public authorities. It does this in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public authorities are obliged to publish certain information about their activities; and</li>
<li>Members of the public are entitled to request information from public authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Act covers any recorded information that is held by a public authority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and by UK-wide public authorities based in Scotland. Information held by Scottish public authorities is covered by Scotland's own Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.</p>
<p>Creative Skillset is not a public body, and therefore is not directly subject to the act. The list of public bodies covered by the act can be <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/3">found here</a>. We will respond to requests for information from members of the public, where the provision of information in response to such an enquiry does not adversely affect Creative Skillset or its stakeholders. This is entirely at the discretion of Creative Skillset, and we are in no way compelled by the Freedom of Information Act to respond to such requests.</p>
<p>All Freedom of Information requests should be sent to&nbsp;Ryan Bright, Systems Analyst at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ryanb@creativeskillset.org" class="popup">ryanb@creativeskillset.org</a>.</p></div>
