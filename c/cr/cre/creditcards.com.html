            <p><b>CreditCards.com Privacy Statement Introduction:</b> CreditCards.com 
              has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of 
              our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. 
              We understand that visitors to our website may have questions about 
              how this website collects and uses information. We have prepared 
              this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern 
              CreditCards.com </p>
            <p>This statement contains numerous general and technical details 
              about the steps we take to respect your privacy concerns. The bottom 
              line is that meeting your needs and expectations form the foundation 
              of everything we do - including protecting your privacy. This website 
              does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer 
              when you browse the site. This means that, unless you voluntarily 
              and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, 
              we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally 
              identifiable information. Internet Protocol (IP) Address: An IP 
              address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
              when you browse the Internet. When users request a page from our 
              site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use IP addresses 
              to help diagnose problems. We do not link IP addresses to any personally 
              identifiable information about you. Cookies: Our website uses "cookie" 
              technology. "Cookies" are strings of text that a website 
              may store on a user's computer. Our website uses cookies but only 
              requires them in the online reservation process. Cookies enable 
              our website to keep track of your preferences and activities relating 
              to the website. Our website creates session cookies for each visit 
              in order to facilitate your visit. </p>
            <p><b>Use of Cookies for Advertising</b> - we use third party service 
              providers to serve and host our advertisements. These third parties 
              use persistent cookies to track the number of times our site is 
              accessed and whether the site was accessed from the advertisement. 
              The cookies generated from the advertisements do not contain personally 
              identifiable information and may remain on your hard drive three 
              or more years unless deleted by you. </p>
            <p>To track the effectiveness of CreditCards.com advertisements on 
              other sites, as well as the effectiveness of our advertising for 
              other sites, CreditCards.com uses pixel tags (also known as "clear 
              gifs", "beacon gifs", "1-by-1 gifs", or 
              "web bugs"). Pixel tags are not visible to the user of 
              the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding. If you are 
              visiting CreditCards.com from an advertisement on another site, 
              the pixel tag references the cookie you received when you clicked 
              on the advertisement. The pixel tag then registers this activity 
              with the third party advertising company to allow us to count the 
              number of times an advertisement is accessed. In addition, we also 
              measure the amount of traffic generated from a particular ad. At 
              no time is personally identifiable information about you or your 
              reservation collected by the third party advertising company, nor 
              is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed 
              to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report web 
              site activity to us or allow us to better target future interactive 
              advertising. Our third party service providers may use pixel tags 
              in CreditCards.com marketing e-mails that help us send the e-mail 
              in a format you can read, to allow us to know which e-mails you 
              act upon and to better target the content of future e-mails. In 
              addition, we track the aggregate number of e-mails read and whether 
              any of the links in the e-mail were accessed. No other information 
              is collected or used from pixel tags. Information We Collect: When 
              we need to collect personally identifiable information from you, 
              we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we 
              need. </p>
            <p><b>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information: </b>All 
              credit card applications listed with CreditCards.com use a Secured 
              Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using a SSL enabled browser 
              such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This 
              ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the 
              Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information 
              is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure 
              mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand 
              corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. You 
              will usually only see this icon only when you are filling out an 
              application. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first 
              characters of the site address will change from "http" 
              to "https." </p>
            <p><b>CreditCards.com Privacy Statement Changes:</b> In the future, 
              we may need to change the privacy statement for CreditCards.com. 
              All changes will be made here so that you will always know what 
              information we gather, how we might use that information and whether 
              we will disclose it to anyone.<br>
