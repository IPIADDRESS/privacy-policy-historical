<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<h2>Our Privacy Policy </h2>
<p>This website is owned and operated by Net Success 2000 Plus of Somerset Kentucky,USA. We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. Though this website does not collect and distribute information in itself, some of the vendors or advertisers displayed on the site may.
</p><p>The following is a summary of some of the ways these vendors may collect and use your information.  We recommend that you read their individual policies before you acquire their services.
</p><h2>Policies of some of our Vendors</h2>
<p> The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by said companies. 	
</p><p>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it? 
</p><p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers known as the "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web Site within the Said  Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address.

</p><p>When using our Sites, Said  or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of Said 's Network of Web Sites you have visited, personalized or customized, so the next time you visit those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content and promotions that you see on our Site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent.

<p>How do you use single-pixel gifs? 	
</p><p>Said  and its advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. Said  does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser. 
</p><p>What information do you collect when I register for something? 
</p><p>Said  offers access to services that are free but that require registration. We will use your registration contact information to send notification of Said  products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information with our clients. Our clients may send you promotional material that is related to the topic of the service for which you registered unless you have chosen not to receive it. Said  reserves the right to send to our registered members email notices and announcements that may be of interest to Said  users. TO NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM Said , MEMBERS SHOULD REQUEST THAT THEIR REGISTRATION BE CANCELLED AND AGREE NOT TO USE ANY FREE Said  SERVICES. For further clarification of this policy, contact us by email at concerns@said.com. 	
</p><p>What other information do you request? 	
</p><p>We will most likely also request your e-mail address or mailing address and other personal information for the purposes of providing additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about seminars). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.   We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Said  products and services. By using services on Said  Web Sites, you are agreeing we can send you this email. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive mailings from other third party companies. 	
</p><p>Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties? 	
</p><p>Said  will disclose personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:  Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities or comply with legal process served on Said ,  Protect and defend the rights or property of the Said  Network of Sites and related properties, or visitors to the Said  Network of Sites and related properties,  Identify persons who may be violating the law, the Said  Web site User Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the Said  Network or its related properties.  Said  uses reasonable precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. Said  reserves the right to transfer all such information in connection with the sale of all or part of Said 's capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such third party privacy policies or how they treat information about their users 	



 </p><h2>Opt-in announcement List Privacy Policy </h2>	
<p>As an added benefit to the visitors of the Said  Network of sites, we have a relationship with Said, an independent third party company that sends e-mail announcements to individuals who request to receive them. When you register you are given the opportunity to also receive announcement lists from Said. Whether you want to receive these announcement lists is your choice; you should only receive those lists you affirmatively choose to. If you choose to receive a specific announcement list, you will receive commercial messages that are related to the topic of the list from independent third parties that have contracted with Said  and/or Saidto send messages to the list. Personally identifiable information will not be used by Said  or Saidfor any purposes other than to deliver the e-mail announcements. You may stop the arrival of these announcement lists at any time by removing your e-mail address from the list by forwarding the announcement list to deleteall@said.com, or by following the instructions on the e-mails you receive.  	
</p><p>What else should I know about my privacy when online? 
</p><p>The Said  Network of Web sites contains many hyperlinks to other Web sites and from Affiliate Web sites. The Said  Web Sites also contain advertisements of third parties. Said  is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or advertisers. Said  does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Said  with the Web sites to which Said  links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Said  may share aggregate data with such Web sites (such as how many people use our Site).
