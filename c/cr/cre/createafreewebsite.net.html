Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser. 
</p><p>What information do you collect when I register for something? 
</p><p>Said  offers access to services that are free but that require registration. We will use your registration contact information to send notification of Said  products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information with our clients.

</p><p>We will most likely also request your e-mail address or mailing address and other personal information for the purposes of providing additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about seminars). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.   We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Said  products and services. By using services on Said  Web Sites, you are agreeing we can send you this email.

 </p><h2>Opt-in announcement List Privacy Policy </h2>	
<p>As an added benefit to the visitors of the Said  Network of sites, we have a relationship with Said, an independent third party company that sends e-mail announcements to individuals who request to receive them. When you register you are given the opportunity to also receive announcement lists from Said. Whether you want to receive these announcement lists is your choice; you should only receive those lists you affirmatively choose to. If you choose to receive a specific announcement list, you will receive commercial messages that are related to the topic of the list from independent third parties that have contracted with Said  and/or Saidto send messages to the list. Personally identifiable information will not be used by Said  or Saidfor any purposes other than to deliver the e-mail announcements. You may stop the arrival of these announcement lists at any time by removing your e-mail address from the list by forwarding the announcement list to deleteall@said.com, or by following the instructions on the e-mails you receive.  	
</p><p>What else should I know about my privacy when online? 
</p><p>The Said  Network of Web sites contains many hyperlinks to other Web sites and from Affiliate Web sites. The Said  Web Sites also contain advertisements of third parties. Said  is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or advertisers. Said  does not share any of the individual personal information you provide Said  with the Web sites to which Said  links, except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although Said  may share aggregate data with such Web sites (such as how many people use our Site).
