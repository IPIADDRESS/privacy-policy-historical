<b>What personally identifiable information does creativepro.com collect from me?</b>
<br><br>
IP Addresses: creativepro.com stores the 
</font></a><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html#IP">Internet Protocol (IP)</a> 
address of your computer when you visit our site. We use your IP address to help 
diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to gather broad 
demographic information.
<br><br>
Some personal information is gathered when you register for membership or shop at the creativeproShop. 
During registration or shopping check-out, creativepro.com asks for your name, e-mail address, and other personal information. 
The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we 
are able to customize your experience.  Once you register you are no longer anonymous 
to creativepro.com - you are given a creativepro.com ID and are able to take full 
advantage of creativepro.com's many offerings.
<br>
<br>
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, 
including (but not limited to) when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by creativepro.com 
and/or our partners; when you make a purchase at the creativeproShop; when you submit a listing for a Web site; and if 
you report a problem with our site or one of our services. Creativepro.com also occasionally asks 
users to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Wherever creativepro.com collects 
personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

<br><br>
A <i>cookie</i> is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit 
them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages 
you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply

<b>Member Registration:</b> when you register  creativepro.com uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. 
We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify

<b>How does creativepro.com use my information?</b>
<br><br>
Creativepro.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their 
experience on our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or 
to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.
<br>
</font></a><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><ul><a name="how">
<li>As stated above, creativepro.com uses information that users voluntarily provide 
in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, 
contests, message boards, and shopping at the creativeproShop. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular 
schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special 
editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something 
we are doing. Creativepro.com never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third 
parties, including advertisers or partners.
</li><li>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't 
like based on traffic to those areas. Creativepro.com does not track what individual users 
read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build 
a better service for you.
</li><li>We track search terms entered in Search.com as one of many measures of what interests our users. 
But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
</li><li>Creativepro.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to 
receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because creativepro.com doesn't track the 
usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked 
their ad.

<b>Who is collecting information?</b>
<br><br>
When you are at creativepro.com or creativeproShop.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information 
with creativepro.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.
<br><br>
Promotions that run on creativepro.com may be sponsored by companies other than creativepro.com or may 
be cosponsored by creativepro.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be 
shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection 
or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

<b>With whom does creativepro.com share my information?</b>
<br><br>
As a general rule, creativepro.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except 
when we have your explicit permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith 
that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.
<br><br>
<u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: Some or all data collected during a creativepro.com promotion may be 
shared with a sponsor or partner. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will 
tell you before we collect or transfer the data.
<br><br>
Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more 
information, you give creativepro.com permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so 
they can fulfill your request. In most instances, only your e-mail address will be shared. If more information 
will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.

The creativeproShop and creativeproBooks are hosted by Amazon.com.  All

has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the 
merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on 
their <i>Information</i> link.
<br><br>
<u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>: Under confidentiality agreements, creativepro.com may 
match user information with third party data. Also, creativepro.com discloses aggregated user statistics 
(e.g., 40% of our members are graphic designers) in order to describe our services to prospective 
partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
<br><br>
<u>Business Transfers:</u> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets.  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.  Also, in the unlikely event that creativepro.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets.
<br><br>
<u>Other</u>: creativepro.com may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to 
believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against 
someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)
creativepro.com's rights or property, other creativepro.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed 
by such activities. Creativepro.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the 
law requires it.

<b>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</b>

If you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from 
creativepro.com or our partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail about products and services that we 
feel might be of interest to you. Only creativepro.com (or agents working on behalf of creativepro.com and under confidentiality

not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you sign up to be

receive such offers or mailings.  In addition, you will be able to unsubscribe to our mailing list by 
clicking on an URL in our newsletter that will automatically remove you from our mailing list.
<br><br>
We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use 
cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, 
and we do not have access to this information.
<br><br>
Except under the special circumstances as previously described, creativepro.com never provides our clients or partners with information that could be used to identify you personally, without first obtaining your express consent. The data that we provide to our clients is always presented in an aggregate manner; therefore, neither the client nor creativepro.com can identify any individual or their associated profile information within that collective data. 
<br><br>
If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.   Creativepro.com does not sell or rent information about individual users to third party marketing and advertising firms.
