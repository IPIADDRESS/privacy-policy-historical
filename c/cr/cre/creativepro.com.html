<b>What personally identifiable information does creativepro.com collect from me?</b>

address of your computer when you visit our site. We use your IP address to help 
diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to gather broad 
demographic information.
<br><br>
Some personal information is gathered when you register for membership or shop at the creativeproShop. 
During registration or shopping check-out, creativepro.com asks for your name, e-mail address, and other personal information. 
The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we 
are able to customize your experience.  Once you register you are no longer anonymous 
to creativepro.com - you are given a creativepro.com ID and are able to take full 
advantage of creativepro.com's many offerings.
<br>
<br>
In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, 
including (but not limited to) when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by creativepro.com 
and/or our partners; when you make a purchase at the creativeproShop; when you submit a listing for a Web site; and if 
you report a problem with our site or one of our services. Creativepro.com also occasionally asks 
users to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Wherever creativepro.com collects 
personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

<b>What are cookies and how does creativepro.com use them?</b>
<br><br>
A <i>cookie</i> is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit 
them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages 
you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply 
yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 
Creativepro.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above), when you register

<b>Member Registration:</b> when you register  creativepro.com uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.

<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="1"> 
<b>How does creativepro.com use my information?</b>
<br><br>
Creativepro.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their 
experience on our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or 
to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.
<br>
<ul>
<li>As stated above, creativepro.com uses information that users voluntarily provide 
in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, 
contests, message boards, and shopping at the creativeproShop. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular 
schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special 
editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something 
we are doing. Creativepro.com never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third 
parties, including advertisers or partners.
</li><li>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't 
like based on traffic to those areas. Creativepro.com does not track what individual users 
read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build 
a better service for you.
</li><li>We track search terms entered in Search.com as one of many measures of what interests our users. 
But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
</li><li>Creativepro.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to 
receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because creativepro.com doesn't track the 
usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked 
their ad.
</li><li>If you make a purchase from the creativeproShop, hosted by creativepro.com, the information obtained during your visit and 
the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is for purchase purposes. This information is 
passed onto the supporting services (credit card processing and product fulfillment) for the store.  These transactions with 
supporting services enables store transactions to take place. Credit card and password information are encrypted during a 
transaction and customer information is accessed only when the appropriate email addresses and ID numbers match, and passwords 
are entered correctly.
