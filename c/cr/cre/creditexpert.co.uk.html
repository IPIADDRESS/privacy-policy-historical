				</p>
				<h2 class="lightBlue">What types of information do we collect about you and how do we use or share this information?</h2>
				<p>
					The primary reason we collect personal and credit information about you is to provide products and services 
					that you have requested and to enrol you into our membership services. The type of information we collect, 
					and the primary purpose for which it is collected includes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Required product registration information such as name, address(es), and date of birth, are utilised to 
					establish your membership or one-time transaction record and to verify your identify. We require this verification 
					in order to provide you with your personal credit information. For security reasons and to protect the confidentiality 
					of your information, we will verify your identity by checking details you supply against details about you held on 
					other databases to which we have access for these purposes. A record of this check will be kept and, with your consent, 
					may be used by other organisations for verification and fraud prevention purposes;
					</li>
					<li>
					Credit information we receive from credit reporting agencies is utilised to provide you with 
					the products and services we offer; 
					</li>
					<li>
					Billing information, such as credit card (or other payment card) number, is required to process the 
					payment for the products and services you order from us;
					</li>
					<li>
					Other information we collect, such as place of birth and mother's maiden name, is used to verify your 
					identity in the event you forget your CreditExpert monitoring service identification or password required 
					for our CreditExpert monitoring service. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Your Alerts: As a CreditExpert member we will alert you to significant changes to your credit report via e-mail. 
					When you initially register with CreditExpert you can choose to receive alerts by text message (SMS) if you prefer. 
					As a member, you can update these preferences in the ‘Update my details´ section of your member centre.
					</li>
					<li>
					Your Experian Credit Score: As a CreditExpert member you may request your Experian Credit Score based upon 
					the information held on your Experian credit report. With your consent, this score may be used to help match you 
					to lenders offering goods and services based upon your credit history and the profile that these lenders are looking for.
					</li>
					<li>
					Any additional credit information you provide to us including (but not limited to) aliases, previous names and 
					addresses and financial relationships with third parties will be added and recorded on your credit report and 
					may be used by us to provide credit reports about you to authorised third parties.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If we are unable to verify your identity from the information you provide to us on this web site we will advise 
					you by e-mail to the e-mail address you specify and you may then wish to make a written application including 
					further proof of identification.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the primary purposes listed above we may also use the information we collect about you as set out in the 
					section entitled "DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES" below or for other authorised secondary purposes such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Creating a profile about you so that we can better inform you and others about particular goods, services or events 
					that may be of interest to you/them and to display that information according to your/their preferences.
					</li>
					<li>
					Dealing with your requests and enquiries.
					</li>
					<li>
					Maintaining our records and for other administrative purposes.
					</li>
					<li>
					Carrying out customer and market/marketing research.
					</li>
					<li>
					Tracking activity on our website. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Protecting our websites and systems against unauthorised access.
					</li>
					<li>
					Improving the quality of our service.
					</li>
				</ul>

				</ul>
				<p>
					We will check your details with the records we hold and share with fraud prevention agencies.

					details will be passed to the other fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access 
					and use this information.
				</p>
				<p>
					We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities.
					</li>
					<li>
					Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities.
					</li>
					<li>
					Recovering debt.

					Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance
					</li>
					<li>
					Checking details of job applicants and employees
					</li>
					<li>
					Please contact us at Experian Ltd, PO Box 8000, Nottingham, NG80 7WF if you want to receive details 
					of the fraud prevention agencies.

					Experian protects your information over the Internet by using secure web server technologies,

					Experian's web server via an encrypted session. Experian employs a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
					connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and Experian. The 128 bit 
					encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cyphertext to safeguard sensitive information 
					during its journey across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, 
					when it reaches its intended destination. When you visit the CreditExpert Web site you may move in and 
					out of secured areas. Any time that you are on a registration page or viewing your personal credit report, 
					you will be in a secured area.
