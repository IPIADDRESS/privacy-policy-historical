<ul class="staticContent">
<li>
Required product registration information such as name, address(es), and date

record and to verify your identify. We require this verification in order to 
provide you with your personal credit information. For security reasons and to 
protect the confidentiality of your information, we will verify your identity

</ul> 
			
<p class="main">

on this web site we will advise you by e-mail to the e-mail address you specify 
and you may then wish to make a written application including further proof of 
identification.</p>
			
<p class="main">
