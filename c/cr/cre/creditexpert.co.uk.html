<h2>What types of information do we collect about you and how do we use or share this information?</h2>
			
<p>
The primary reason we collect personal and credit information about you is to provide products and services that you have requested and to enrol you into our membership services. The type of information we collect, and the primary purpose for which it is collected includes:</p>
			

<ul><li>
Required product registration information such as name, address(es), and date of birth, 
are utilised to establish your membership or one-time transaction record and to verify 
your identify. We require this verification in order to provide you with your personal 
credit information. For security reasons and to protect the confidentiality of your information, 
we will verify your identity by checking details you supply against details about you held on 
other databases to which we have access for these purposes. 
A record of this check will be kept and, with your consent, may be used by other organisations

</li><li>
Any additional credit information you provide to us including (but not limited to) aliases, 
previous names and addresses and financial relationships with third parties will be added 
and recorded on your credit report and may be used by us to provide credit reports about 
you to authorised third parties.
</li></ul>	
		
<p>
If we are unable to verify your identity from the information you provide to us on this web site we will advise you by e-mail to the e-mail address you specify and you may then wish to make a written application including further proof of identification.</p>
			
<p>
In addition to the primary purposes listed above we may also use the information we collect about you as set out in the section entitled "DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES" below or for other authorised secondary purposes such as: </p>
		
<ul>
<li>creating a profile about you so that we can better inform you and others about particular goods, services or events that may be of interest to you/them and to display that information according to your/their preferences.
</li><li>dealing with your requests and enquiries

<ul>

</li><li>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements about our products and services on our behalf.
</li><li>If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, we will record this and details will be passed to the other fraud prevention agencies.
		</li><li>Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

<h2>Cookies</h2>
			
<p>
Cookies and similar devices such as web bugs may be used by us to provide you with information from our web site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. We use cookies to help us understand volumes of visitors looking at particular web pages and advertisements to help us determine how frequently particular pages are visited and to determine the most popular areas of our web site. Cookies may also allow us to make our web site more stable so that we can give you a better and more user friendly experience when you return to our web site, for example, allowing us to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter it every time you visit our web site. We do not use cookies to record other information on individuals. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You do not have to accept cookies and you should read the information that came with your browser software to see how you can set up your browser to notify you when you receive cookies, this will give you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. If you chose to disable cookies you may not be able to access certain features of a particular web site.</p>
			

<h2>Marketing options</h2>
	
<p>
We will tell you about significant changes to your credit report, credit-related news, and member offers.  YOU WILL ONLY RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM CREDITEXPERT.</p>
		
<p>All of our communications will give you the opportunity to unsubscribe.</p>	
			
<h2>How do we protect your information?
</h2>
			
<p>
We restrict access to your personal data to those employees, and third parties, who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data.</p>
			
<p>
Experian protects your information over the Internet by using secure web server technologies, which allows web browser programs (Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with Experian's web server via an encrypted session.

<h2>Data transfers</h2>
<p>
Because we operate throughout the world in providing our goods and services, this may involve us transferring your personal information to countries whose data protection laws do not provide the same level of protection as those in the UK. If we do so, we will ensure that an agreement is in place in which anyone to whom we pass the information agrees to treat it with the same level of protection as if we were dealing with it.</p>
