	  <p class="p2">Creditplus will allow a 7 day notice period from delivery, for notification of any mechanical or body defects providing they are not commensurate with the vehicle age and mileage or notified to you before delivery.

The cancellation fee does not apply if the vehicle order is cancelled under these terms. No other rights of cancellation apply or will be accepted. Order pricing is valid for 14 days. If you are purchasing the vehicle using finance you need to refer to the lenders terms and conditions.</p>

			<p class="p2">If a New or Pre-registered car is returned the customer bears the cost of return along with a cancellation fee of 10% of the car value or a minimum of £1000, whichever is the greater.</p>
