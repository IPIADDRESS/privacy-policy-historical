<p>
Welcome to Credible.com, the website and online service of Credible Labs Inc. (“Credible,” “we,” or “us”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
</p>
</div>
<h3 id="how-we-collect">How we collect and use information</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use. By using the Service, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and Credible’s Terms of Use. We collect the following types of information about you:
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Information you provide us directly</h5>
<p>
The information we collect from you will vary depending on the product or service requested. We may ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, birth date, telephone number, email address, college or university, year of graduation, course of study, outstanding loan balances, social security number, income, employment history and other details related to your financial situation when you register for a Credible account, submit an Offer request or if you correspond with us. We may collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when using the Service.
</p>
<p>
We may also collect and store information that you provide to us about other people (such as co-signers), including their first and last name, address, telephone number, birth date, email address, and social security number.
</p>
<p>
We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, customer service correspondence, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.
</p>
<p>
We use this information to operate, maintain and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. This may include customization and tailoring the Service features according to the information that you provide.
</p>
<p>
We may directly collect analytics data, or use third party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Cookies information</h5>
<p>
When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Credible help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Log file information</h5>
<p>
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Clear gifs/web beacons information</h5>
<p>
When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Commercial and marketing communications</h5>
<p>
We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Use of certain service type information we collect about you</h5>
<p>
We use or may use cookies, log file and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in and; (g) provide advertising to your browser.
</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sharing-information">Sharing of your information</h3>

We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Credible and its group companies (including any parent, subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below:
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h5>Who we may share your information with</h5>
<p>
We may share your information with Providers for the purpose of providing the Service to you such that they may provide you with information about Offers and other products and services they offer. If you sign up for a promotion, submit an Offer request, enroll in a service with a Provider, we may provide information that you have provided to us to Providers. Those Providers will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service.
</p>
<p>
You agree that when you submit information to a Provider through the Service as a part of an Offer request, submission of your information to Providers may also be governed by Provider privacy and security policies which differ from the our Privacy Policy. It is your obligation to inquire as to the details of such policies from Providers directly.
</p>
<p>
You understand that Providers may keep your information that relates to any Offer request that you may make through using the Service and any other information provided by Credible in the processing of any Offer request, whether or not you are qualified for an Offer from that Provider. You agree to notify any particular provider directly if you no longer want to them to keep your information.
</p>
<p>
You agree that when you nominate a co-signer on an Offer request, that Credible may share Provider responses and/or Offers relating to your Offer request with your nominated co-signer.
</p>
<p>
We may also share your information with other parties, such as third party service providers, who assist in completion of your information and/or verification of your identity. This may include (but is not limited to); credit bureaus, service providers that provide access to your existing accounts (at your request), your school, and other parties involved in the Offer request process.
</p>
<p>
We also remind you that under our Terms of Use you authorize the use of your Account information to help complete Offer request forms.

Credible will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Credible, our Users or others.

<h5>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you</h5>

<div class="section">
<h5>Ads on Credible</h5>
<p>
We may also share certain information such as your browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Credible may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Credible does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
Please note that an advertiser may ask Credible to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Credible determines the target audience and Credible serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
</p>
<p>
The Credible Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.

<h5>Keeping your information safe</h5>
<p>
Credible cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service.

The maximum variable rate on the Education Refinance Loan is the greater of 21.00% or Prime Rate plus 9.00%. Subject to additional terms and conditions, and rates are subject to change at any time without notice. Such changes will only apply to applications taken after the effective date of change. Please note: Due to federal regulations, Citizens Bank is required to provide every potential borrower with disclosure information before they apply for a student loan. You will be presented with an Application Disclosure and an Approval Disclosure within the application process before you accept the terms and conditions of your loan. The starting interest rate you pay will be determined after you apply. It will be based upon your credit history and other factors (chosen repayment option and co-signer credit, if applicable). If approved, Citizens Bank will notify you of the rate you qualify for within the stated range. If you are approved for this loan, the loan terms will be available for 30 days (terms will not change during this period, except as permitted by law and the variable interest rate may change based on the market). Late Charges: If your payment or any portion of your payment is more than fifteen (15) days late, you agree to pay a late charge of 5% of the payment amount. Returned Payment Charge: If you make a payment, and that payment (including an electronic payment) is returned or refused by your bank for any reason, you agree to pay a charge of $15.00 for each such payment returned or refused. This is in addition to any fee that your bank may also charge you. Charges for Optional Services: If you request and Lender agrees to provide optional services in connection with your loan, Lender may charge you and you agree to pay the fees for such services. The fees will be disclosed to you before you accept any such service. Optional services may include, but are not limited to: (1) allowing you to make an expedited payment on your loan, and (2) sending documents to you by express delivery or facsimile transmission.
