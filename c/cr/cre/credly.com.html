This privacy policy describes how Credly treats the information you provide to us or that we otherwise collect. This Privacy Policy also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. “<strong>You</strong>” refers to the person or entity using the Service. The “<strong>Service</strong>” is the digital credentialing and certification functionality, associated insights and connection to relevant career, education and training opportunities provided through any website or application offered by Credly. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” includes the information we collect directly from you as well as personal information from Issuers (defined below) and Third-Party Services (defined below). This Privacy Policy sets out how we will treat the personal data which you provide to us in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (<strong>GDPR</strong>).</p><p>Please read this Policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use and share personal data, your rights in relation to your personal data, how to contact us and supervisory authorities in the event that you would like to report a concern about the way in which we process your data.</p><p>This Privacy Policy describes our broadest potential use of your Personal Information, although we may actually make far less use. The basis for our processing of your Personal Information is your consent. No law requires you to provide us with your Personal Information. You may withdraw your consent for us to process your Personal Information at any time, but that may preclude you thereafter from using the Website and the Service. We will delete your Personal Information following the withdrawal of your consent, however, such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal.</p><p>Credly collects Personal Information when you choose to submit it through e-mail, an online form, or other method. We also collect information through cookies (see “Credly Use of ‘Cookies’” section below for detail).</p><p>Credly also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to our websites, including but not limited to, internet protocol (“IP”) address (a computer's numerical Internet address), third party websites from which visitors access our website, type of web browsers used, and pages viewed. Such information may be treated as Personal Information.</p><p>By your use of the Service you consent to our use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>Credly is a Delaware corporation with offices in New York City. Our registered address is 349 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5019.</p><p>The Credly Service is an internet-based, hosted platform designed to enable subscribers to the Service (“<strong>Issuers</strong>”) to issue digital badges and credentials (“<strong>Credentials</strong>”) to individuals who meet prescribed requirements (“<strong>Earners</strong>”), and for those Earners to display the Credentials online on the Service or on third party sites, as elected by Earners.</p><p>We may provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of, or with, Credly under confidentiality agreements to help Credly provide the Service. They may also assist Credly in communicating with you about the Service and about offers from Credly and our partners, where you have given us appropriate permissions.</p><p>For the purposes of the GDPR, Credly is the ‘processor’ of certain types of Personally Identifiable Data provided by Issuers and the ‘controller’ of other types of Personally Identifiable Data provided directly to us by Earners. Credly offers a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) for qualifying organizations available upon request by emailing privacy@credly.com.</p><p>You may contact our Primary Point of Contact for data privacy and security with any questions, comments or concerns about this policy by sending an email to privacy@credly.com.</p><p>Credly owns and operates Credly.com and YourAcclaim.com.

We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. Credly is committed to the Privacy Shield Principles of (1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability with respect to all Personal Data received from within the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p><p>Credly is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Credly complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p><p>Credly is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p><p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p><p><strong>What personal data do we collect?</strong></p><p>Issuers provide Personal Information to us, including Credential requirements, and information about you to confirm that you have earned the applicable Credential.
