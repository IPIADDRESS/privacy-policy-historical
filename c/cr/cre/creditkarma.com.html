<p><strong><u>1. What Information Do We Collect?</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

<p>
    When you register with Credit&nbsp;Karma or use our Services, we may ask you to
    provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personal
    information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify
    you personally, such as your name, address, email address, date of birth,
    Social Security number, driver’s license number or phone number
    (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>).  (As explained above, any
    information from a credit report that we obtain about you is covered in our
    Terms of Use, and is not included in this Privacy Policy’s definition of
    Personal Information); and (2) demographic information, such as information
    about your family (<strong>“Demographic Information”</strong>).
</p>

<p>
    In addition to other information Personal Information, we collect when you
    register, we may collect your driver's license number and social security
    number as a requirement of the credit bureau to verify your identity.  We use
    this information in order to fulfill your request for a credit score.  We may
    collect Personal Information through various other forms and in various places
    through the Services, including contact us forms, or when you otherwise
    interact with us.
</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect As You Access And Use The Services</strong></p>

<p>
    In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you
    choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a
    variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain
    information whenever you visit or interact with the Services
    (<strong>“Usage Information”</strong>).  For example, Credit&nbsp;Karma
    automatically receives and records information that your browser sends
    whenever you visit the Credit&nbsp;Karma website.  These server logs may include
    information such as your IP address or other unique identifier
    (<strong>“Device Identifier”</strong>), browser type, browser language, the
    date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely
    identify your browser from your computer or other device used to access the
    Services (any, a <strong>“Device”</strong>).  A Device Identifier is a
    number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the
    Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
</p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma uses aggregate data collected in log files and cookies for
    general purposes: to enhance or otherwise improve the Services, to
    customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services,
    develop new services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for
    internal and external clients.  These cookies and log files do not store
    your Personal Information, but they are tied to your Personal Information
    in our system.
</p>

<p>
    Below are examples of methods that we may use to collect Usage Information.
    In the future, other new technology and methods for collecting Usage
    Information may develop.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device
    when it is used to access the Services.  A Flash cookie is a data file placed
    on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded
    by you to your Device.  Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many
    purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences
    and tracking your visits to our web pages.  If you choose to disable cookies or
    Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function
    properly.  Credit&nbsp;Karma uses cookies when you sign in, to identify you and keep
    track of your personal session.  All this information is securely stored, and
    no Personal Information is stored on your cookie.
</p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our
    site.  Session ID cookies expire upon 30 minutes of inactivity or when you
    close your browser whichever is shorter.  We also use a persistent cookie that
    remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that we can
    recognize you when you return to our web site. You can remove persistent
    cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help"
    file; however, because we use cookies for our sign-in functionality, if you
    choose to disable cookies you will not be able to log on to the Credit&nbsp;Karma
    web site.
</p>

<p>
    Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers or tracking utility company)
    use cookies on our site.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong>.  Small graphic images or other web
    programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”)
    may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages.  Web beacons may be
    invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code
    inserted into a web or mobile page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web
    beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes,
    including, without limitation, to count users of the Services, to monitor how
    users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were
    actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually
    viewed.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard
    drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of
    the period at the end of this sentence.  We do not tie web beacons to Personal
    Information.  We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track
    non-persofnally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the
    aggregate – e.g., usage and volume statistics to enhance and improve our Web
    site.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><em>Embedded Scripts</em></strong>.  An embedded script is programming
    code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the
    Services, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded
    onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is
    active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or
    deleted thereafter.
</p>

<p><strong>Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong></p>

<p>
    From time to time, we may supplement the information we collect about you with
    outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve
    you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase
    products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may combine
    the information we receive from those sources with information we collect
    through the Services.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any
    Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
</p>

<p><strong>Information You Provide About A Third Party</strong></p>

<p>
    If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services,
    we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will
    automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit
    the site.  Credit&nbsp;Karma stores this information for the sole purpose of sending
    this one-time email and tracking the success of our Invite-A-Friend referral
    program.  The information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used
    to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose
    unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.
    Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality through
    our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to
    your friend.
</p>

<p>
    Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@creditkarma.com">legal@creditkarma.com</a> to request
    that we remove this information from our database.
</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected by Mobile Applications</strong></p>

<p>
    Certain aspects of the Services may be provided through an application on your
    mobile, tablet computer, or similar device (<strong>“Mobile
        Application”</strong>).  You agree that we may collect and use technical
    data and related information, including but not limited to, technical
    information about your device, system and application software, and
    peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of
    software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to
    such Mobile Applications.
</p>

<p>
    When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may
    automatically collect and store information from your mobile device
    (<strong>“Mobile Device Information”</strong>).  Here are some examples of the
    Mobile Device Information that may be collected and stored:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your preferred language</li>
    <li>Your phone number or other unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device</li>
    <li>The unique device identifier or IP address of your mobile device</li>
    <li>Your mobile operating system</li>

    subject to the privacy policy of the platform to which you upload the content.
</p>

<p><strong><u>2. How and When Do We Disclose Other Information To Third Parties?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties
    for any purpose.  Credit&nbsp;Karma only shares Personal Information with companies
    or individuals who are not our agents or services providers when we have your
    consent, or as otherwise permitted by this policy.
</p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated,
    non-Personal Information, such as the number of users who clicked on a
    particular advertisement.  Such information does not identify you individually.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties.</strong>  You
    may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing
    offers directly from unaffiliated third parties.  These offers vary from day to
    day, but in general if you are interested in a particular offer, you will be
    taken to a third party site to complete the transaction.  Know that the third
    parties' privacy policy governs the collection and use of your personal
    information.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of
    such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and
    practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information
    from them.  If you later decide that you no longer want to receive
    communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party
    directly.
</p>

<p>
    On our Services, Credit&nbsp;Karma may serve you targeted advertisements based on
    your Personal Information.  Advertisers on our Services may include financial
    service providers (such as banks, credit card providers, insurance agents,
    stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as cable
    providers, airlines, wireless carriers and software companies).  Advertisers
    may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet
    certain targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 with a certain
    minimum credit score.  However, Credit&nbsp;Karma does not provide advertisers any
    of your Personal Information when you view or interact with a targeted ad.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>When You Request A Credit Report And Score.</strong>  We use other
    third parties to provide credit report and score data on our site.  When you
    request a credit report and score on our site, we will share your personal
    information and sensitive information with the third party to verify your
    identity and provide that service.
</p>

<p>
    These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any
    other purpose including their own marketing.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.</strong>  We may use
    third party vendors to perform certain aspects of the Services on our or your
    behalf, such as hosting the Services, designing and/or operating the Services’
    features, tracking the Services analytics, and enabling Credit&nbsp;Karma to send
    you special offers or performing other administrative services.  We may provide
    these vendors with access to user information, including Personal Information,
    to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us.  While we may
    use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with
    information about the use of the Services and viewing of our content, we do not
    share Personal Information with these analytics service providers, but they may
    set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your
    Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you,
    including non-personal information.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Co-Branded Services.</strong>  Certain aspects of the Services may
    be provided to you in association with third parties (<strong>“Co-Branded
        Services”</strong>) such as our advertisers, business partners, or
    sponsors, and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them.
    Such Co-Branded Services will identify the third party.  If you elect to
    register for products and/or services through the Co-Branded Services, you
    may be providing your information to both us and the third party.  Any such
    information provided to the third party is subject to that third party’s
    privacy policies.  Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Service with a
    username and password obtained through the Services, your Personal
    Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that
    Co-Branded Service and will be subject to their posted privacy policies.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</strong> We may offer
    sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a
    <strong>“Promotion”</strong>) through the Services that may require
    registration.  By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official
    rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of
    you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice
    and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion.  If
    you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third
    parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion,
    including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as
    required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a
    winners list.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Administrative and Legal Reasons.</strong>  We may access, use,
    preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Personal
    Information, including disclosure to third parties: (i) to satisfy any
    applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal
    process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law;
    (ii) to protect and/or defend the <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/about/terms">Terms of Use</a> for any
    online Services or other policies applicable to any online Services,
    including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect
    the safety, rights, property or security of the Services or any third
    party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security
    or technical issues.  Further, we may use IP addresses or other Device
    Identifiers, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third
    parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless
    service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing
    such information to third parties, all in our discretion.  Such disclosures
    may be carried out without notice to you.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Business Transfer.</strong>  We may share your information, including
    your Personal Information, and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries
    and affiliates for internal reasons.  We also reserve the right to disclose and
    transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator
    of the Services or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate
    merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our
    membership interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during
    the course of any due diligence process.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Information Collected by Mobile Applications.</strong>  For any Mobile
    Applications, the information the Mobile Application collects may be stored
    locally on your device and may be transmitted to our (or our agents’) servers
    in the United States (collectively, the <strong>“Servers”</strong>).  We will
    have access to your information or your information will be transferred to the
    Servers in any of the following circumstances:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Mobile Application may require you and each of your authorized users to register for a personal account accessible through a confidential password and user name that you select.  We will collect and store this registration data on the Servers.</li>
    <li>Your other user information will be transferred to the Servers in order to accomplish other functions as permitted by this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li>Device Identifier or device information generated by the Mobile Application are transferred to and stored on the Servers.</li>
    <li>We may also access certain data from the Mobile Application, including without limitation information you supply and device information, for statistical analysis.  All such data has been anonymized prior to our collection and storage on the Servers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>3. How Do We Use The Information Collected?</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Special Offers and Updates:</strong></p>

<p>
    We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special
    deals, or promotions.  Out of respect for your privacy, we present the
    option not to receive these types of communications by logging into your
    account and visiting the <strong>"My Profile"</strong> page and by
    following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.
</p>

<p><strong>Service-related Announcements:</strong></p>

<p>
    We will send you strictly service-related announcements when it is necessary to
    do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance,
    we might send you an email.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not
    promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option
    to deactivate your account.
</p>

<p><strong>Customer Service:</strong></p>

<p>
    Based upon the personal information you provide us, we will send you a
    welcoming email to verify your username and password.  We will also communicate
    with you via email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you
    request, and to manage your account.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that information submitted through the Services via a “contact us”
    or other similar function may not receive a response.
</p>

<p><strong><u>4. What About Information I Disclose Publicly?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    The Services may permit you to submit ideas, questions, comments, suggestions
    or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, <strong>“User
        Content”</strong>), that is publicly viewable (such as on public portions
    of your user profile).  We or others may reproduce, publish, distribute or
    otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently
    existing or hereafter developed).  Others may have access to this User Content
    and may have the ability to share it with third parties across the Internet.
    Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including
    Personal Information, in connection with your User Content.
</p>

<p>
    Note that Credit&nbsp;Karma does not control who will have access to the information
    that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access
    to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it
    secure.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you
    disclose publicly or share with others, whether through the Services or
    otherwise.  We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any
    content or information that you disclose or receive through the Services.
</p>

<p><strong><u>5. What is Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can I Opt-Out?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    We contract with third-party advertising networks, publishers and other
    entities to advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with
    us.&nbsp; Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising – which serve
    advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal
    behavioral information.&nbsp; Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of
    websites (including our own websites that part of our own Services) and your
    response to our advertisements. Cookies placed by these companies do not
    collect Personal Information. We limit companies that place our ads from using
    information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.
    If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of network
    advertising programs that use your information.   To do so, please visit: the
    Network Advertising Initiative industry’s <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">opt-out page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from
    us. Opting out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do
    receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior.
</p>

<p>
    In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your
    browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device,
    access our Services from a different device, login under a different screen
    name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser
    has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral
    advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check
    your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or
    disabled.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that even if you choose to remove your information
    (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online.
    However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your
    interests.  Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view
    and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing
    activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted
    advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that
    identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides
    links to those companies.
</p>

<p><strong><u>6. How Do I Change or Inquire About My Information And Communications Preferences?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit
    to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration.  You
    can access and make changes to the Personal Information you submit, including
    your marketing preferences, at any time by using the username and password you
    selected at the time of registration and making the change on our "My Profile"
    page.  If you no longer desire our service, you may delete or deactivate it by
    following the instructions detailed in the <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/about/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
</p>

<p>
    New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing
    Preferences page from time to time, but we will require your consent and notice
    before marketing to you in this new way. We give you the opportunity to
    "opt-out" of having Personal Information used. For example, you can elect not
    to receive newsletters or alert emails. You can do this by logging into your
    account and visiting the "My Profile" page and you may also follow the
    unsubscribe instructions included in each email.
</p>

<p><strong><u>7. Do Third Party Content And Links To Third Party Services Appear on the Services?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma may post links to third party web sites that are not subject to
    this privacy policy.  We do not exercise control over the external sites.
    These sites may place their own cookies or other files on your Device, collect
    data, web site usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from
    the Services are served to your browser, or solicit Personal Information from
    you.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these
    third parties.  For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, the
    “click” may take you away from the Services onto a different web site.  These
    other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data
    or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published
    privacy policies.  We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to
    read the privacy statements of all third party web sites or applications before
    submitting any Personal Information to third parties.
</p>

<p><strong><u>8. What About Consent To Transfer Information To The United States?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    The Services are operated in the United States and intended for users located
    in the United States.  If you are located anywhere outside of the United
    States, please be aware that information we collect, including, Personal
    Information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.
    The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the
    country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject
    to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United
    States according to laws of the United States.  By using the Services or
    providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and
    storage of your information in the United States.
</p>

<p><strong><u>9. What Should Parents Know About Children?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18.  Thus,
    we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than
    the age of thirteen (13).  We will delete any Personal Information collected
    that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen
    (13).  If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen
    (13) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please
    contact us at privacy@creditkarma.com via email or write to us at:
    Credit&nbsp;Karma, Inc. Attention: Privacy Department, 115 Sansome Street, Suite
    400, San Francisco, CA 94104.
</p>

<p><strong><u>10. What Happens If I Terminate My Account?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    Because Credit&nbsp;Karma is a financial services company, there are certain legal
    reporting and information retention requirements with which we must comply.
    Therefore, we cannot delete your account information outright.  However, we
    will encrypt your information and disable your account, which will be inactive
    and not accessible to anyone other than Credit&nbsp;Karma authorized personnel.
    After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then
    may be held by us definitely.  Moreover, once your account is terminated, you
    will not receive any further communications from Credit&nbsp;Karma. To terminate
    your account, please follow the instructions detailed in the <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/about/terms">Terms
        of Use</a>.
</p>

<p><strong><u>11. What About Security?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that
    comply with federal regulations to protect Personal Information that we collect
    about you.
</p>

<p>
    We enable our servers with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to establish a
    secure connection between your computer and our servers, creating a private
    session.
</p>

<p>
    We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from
    external attack and securely store your Personal Information. We control access
    to this information via secure web pages, and limit access to only those
    employees or third parties on a need to know basis.
</p>

<p>
    Credit&nbsp;Karma tests our systems regularly to insure that our security mechanisms
    are up to date.
</p>

<p>
    We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure
    your Personal Information and Credit Report Information.  However, no data
    transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission or electronic storage of
    information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please note that we cannot
    ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our
    Services and provide us with your information at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an email
    to us at <a href="mailto:legal@creditkarma.com">legal@creditkarma.com</a>.
</p>

<p><strong><u>12. What About Changes to the Credit&nbsp;Karma Privacy Policy?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without
    notice to you.  Credit&nbsp;Karma will promptly post any policy changes to this
    page.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the
    revised Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    If there are any material changes in the way we treat Personal Information
    and/or Credit Report Information, Credit&nbsp;Karma will notify you by sending a
    notice to the primary email address specified in your marketing preferences or
    by placing a prominent notice on our site prior to the change becoming
    effective.
</p>

<p><strong><u>13. Your California Privacy Rights</u></strong></p>

<p>
    California’s “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires
    certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers (those who
    have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business’
    practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the
    third parties’ direct marketing purposes.   We do not share customer
    information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and
    California’s Shine the Light law therefore does not apply to Credit&nbsp;Karma.
</p>

<p><strong><u>14. What about Social Media Widgets features?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button
    and Widgets, the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our
    site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting
    on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
    Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted
    directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the
    privacy policy of the company providing it.
</p>

<p><strong><u>15. How Do I Find Out More?</u></strong></p>

<p>
    For additional information, or if you have questions regarding this policy
    or privacy practices at Credit&nbsp;Karma, please submit your questions or
    comments directly to <a href="mailto:privacy@creditkarma.com">privacy@creditkarma.com</a> via email or
