    <span class="bold">Credit Karma takes your privacy seriously.  This policy covers how Credit Karma treats personal information that
    Credit Karma collects and receives.</span><br>
    Credit Karma is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy statement          covers the Web site <a href="www.creditkarma.com">www.creditkarma.com</a>.  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance       by TRUSTe.
</p>
<p class="offertext">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Credit Karma at <a href="mailto:privacy@creditkarma.com">privacy@creditkarma.com</a>.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a> .

<p class="offeertext">
    
    </p><p class="offertext">
        <span class="bold">Information we collect and how we use it:</span><br>
Credit Karma collects personal information when you register with Credit Karma.  Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number.<br><br>
When you register we ask for information such as name, address, date of birth, and email address.  We may collect your driver's license number and social security number as a requirement of the credit bureau to verify your identity.  We use this information in order to fulfill your request for a credit score.<br><br>
Credit Karma automatically receives and records information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Credit Karma website.  These server logs may include information such as your IP Address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.<br><br>
Credit Karma uses aggregate data collected in log files and cookies for general purposes:  to customize the advertising and content you see, improve our services, develop new services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.  These cookies and log files are not tied to your personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p class="offertext">If you post a comment regarding one of the special offers on the site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this  forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.  We reserve the right to remove any offensive or personally identifiable information that is posted.</p>


<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Special Offers on the Site:</span><br>These offers vary from day to day, but in general if you are interested in a particular offer you will be taken to a third party site to complete the transaction.  Know that the third parties' privacy policy governs the collection and use of your personally identifiable information and we encourage you to read their privacy polices.</p>

<p class="offertext"><span class="bold">Invite-A-Friend:</span><br>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Credit Karma stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our Invite-A-Friend referral program.</p>


<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Information sharing:</span><br>
    Credit Karma will not share your credit data with any anyone at anytime except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
    Credit Karma does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for any purpose.<br><br>
    Credit Karma only shares personal information with companies or individuals who are not our agents or services providers in the following limited circumstances:<br><br>
    We have your consent.  We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any personal information.<br><br>
    We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
    Credit Karma displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.<br><br>
    Credit Karma does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad.<br><br>
    Credit Karma advertisers may include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as cable providers, airlines, wireless carriers and software companies).<br><br>
    Credit Karma may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.  Such information does not identify you individually.
</p>

<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Service Providers:</span><br>
    We use other third parties to provide credit checks on our site.  When you sign up for a credit report on our site, we will share your personally identifiable information and sensitive information with the third party to verify your identity and provide that service.</p>
<p class="offertext">These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing.</p>

<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Marketing choices and access to your information:</span><br>
    You can access and make changes to the personal information you submit, including your marketing preferences, at anytime by using the username and password you selected at the time of registration.<br><br>
    New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time, but we will require your consent and notice before marketing to you in this new way.  We give you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having personal information used.  For example, you can elect not to receive newsletters or alert emails.  You can do this by logging into your account and visiting the "Account" page and you may also follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.
</p>


<p class="offertext"><span class="bold">Special Offers and Updates:</span><br>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions.  Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications by logging into your account and visiting the "account" page and by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.</p>

<p class="offertext"><span class="bold">Service-related Announcements:</span><br>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.<br><br>
Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
</p>

<p class="offertext"><span class="bold">Customer Service:</span><br>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.  We will also communicate with you via email in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.
</p>

<p class="offertext"><span class="bold">Termination</span><br>Because Credit Karma is a financial services company, there are certain legal reporting and information retention requirements with which we must comply.  Therefore, we cannot delete your account information outright.  However, we will encrypt your information and disable your account, which will be inactive and not accessible to anyone other than Credit Karma authorized personnel.  Moreover, once your account is terminated, you will not receive any further communications from Credit Karma.  To terminate your account, please follow the instructions detailed in the <a href="http://www.creditkarma.com/about/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.
</p>
<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Use of cookies:</span><br>
    Cookies are small text files created by a web site that store information on your computer, such as your preferences when visiting that site.  Credit Karma uses cookies when you sign in, to identify you and keep track of your personal session.  All this information is securely stored, and no personal information is stored on your cookie.<br><br>
    Credit Karma uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. Session ID cookies expire upon 30 minutes of inactivity or when you close your browser whichever is shorter.  We use a persistent cookie that remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time, so that we can recognize you when you return to our web site.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file; however, because we use cookies for our sign-in functionality, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to log on to the Credit Karma web site.<br><br>
    Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers or tracking utility company) use cookies on our site. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
</p>
<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Use of web beacons:</span><br>
    We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better understand user interaction with our web site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.   We do not tie Web beacons to personally identifiable information.<br>
    We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate  e.g. usage and volume statistics to enhance and improve our Web site.
</p>
<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Third party links:</span><br>
    Credit Karma may post links to third party web sites that are not subject to this privacy policy.  We do not exercise control over the external sites.  These sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  We urge you to review their privacy policy policies before providing them with any personal information.
</p>

<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Access to Personally Identifiable Information:</span><br>
    If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our "Account" page.
</p>

<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Protecting your information:</span><br>
    Credit Karma maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information that we collect about you.<br><br>
    We enable our servers with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to establish a secure connection between your computer and our servers, creating a private session.<br><br>
    We employ firewalls and other security technologies to protect our servers from external attack and securely store your personal information.  We control access to this information via secure web pages, and limit access to only those employees or third parties on a need to know basis.<br><br>
    Credit Karma tests our systems regularly to insure that our security mechanisms are up to date.<br><br>
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>
    If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@creditkarma.com">privacy@creditkarma.com</a>
</p>

<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Children under 18:</span><br>
    Credit Karma services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18.
</p>
<p class="offertext">
    <span class="bold">Changes to the Credit Karma Privacy Policy:</span><br>
    Credit Karma may update this policy at any time.<br><br>
    Credit Karma will promptly post any policy changes to this page.<br><br>
    If there are any material changes in the way we treat personal information Credit Karma will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your marketing preferences or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
