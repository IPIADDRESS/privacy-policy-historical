<p>
            </p>
<h3><strong>6. Access and correction</strong></h3>
<p>6.1 If The company holds personal information about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the information on request by the individual, except to the extent that:</p>
<p>(a) in the case of personal information other than health information”providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; or</p>
<p>(b) in the case of health information”providing access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual; or</p>
<p>(c) providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or</p>
<p>(d) the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or</p>
<p>(e) the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between the organisation and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or</p>
<p>(f) providing access would reveal the intentions of the organisation in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or</p>
<p>(g) providing access would be unlawful; or</p>
<p>(h) denying access is required or authorised by or under law; or</p>
<p>(i) providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or</p>
<p>(j) providing access would be likely to prejudice:</p>
<p>(i) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a prescribed law; or</p>
<p>(ii) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; or</p>

<p>(v) the preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of its orders;</p>
<p>by or on behalf of an enforcement body; or</p>
<p>(k) an enforcement body performing a lawful security function asks the organisation not to provide access to the information on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the security of Australia.</p>
<p>6.2 However, where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within the organisation in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, the company give the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct access to the information.</p>
<p>6.3 If the company is not required to provide the individual with access to the information because of one or more of paragraphs 6.1(a) to (k) (inclusive), the the company will, if reasonable, consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.</p>
<p>6.4 If the company charges for providing access to personal information, those charges:</p>
<p>(a) will not be excessive; and</p>
<p>(b) will not apply to lodging a request for access.</p>
<p>6.5 If the company holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, the organisation must take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date.</p>
<p>6.6 If the individual and the company disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the individual asks the organisation to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, the organisation must take reasonable steps to do so.</p>
<p>6.7 The company will provide reasons for denial of access or a refusal to correct personal information.</p>
<p>
            </p>
<h3><strong>7. Identifiers</strong></h3>
<p>7.1 The company will not adopt as its own identifier of an individual an identifier of the individual that has been assigned by:</p>
<p>(a) an agency; or</p>
<p>(b) an agent of an agency acting in its capacity as agent; or</p>
<p>(c) a contracted service provider for a Commonwealth contract acting in its capacity as contracted service provider for that contract.</p>
<p>7.2 The company will not use or disclose an identifier assigned to an individual by an agency, or by an agent or contracted service provider mentioned in subclause 7.1, unless:</p>
<p>(a) the use or disclosure is necessary for the organisation to fulfil its obligations to the agency; or</p>
<p>(b) one or more of paragraphs 2.1(e) to 2.1(h) (inclusive) apply to the use or disclosure; or</p>
<p>(c) the use or disclosure is by a prescribed organisation of a prescribed identifier in prescribed circumstances.</p>
<p>7.3 In this clause:</p>
<p>identifier includes a number assigned by an organisation to an individual to identify uniquely the individual for the purposes of the organisation’s operations. However, an individual’s name or ABN (as defined in the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999) is not an identifier.</p>
<p>
            </p>
<h3><strong>8. Anonymity</strong></h3>
<p>Wherever it is lawful and practicable, individuals must have the option of not identifying themselves when entering transactions with the company.</p>
<p>
            </p>
<h3><strong>9. Transborder data flows</strong></h3>
<p>The company may transfer personal information about an individual to someone (other than the organisation or the individual) who is in a foreign country only if:</p>
<p>(a) the company reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the National Privacy Principles; or</p>
<p>(b) the individual consents to the transfer; or</p>
<p>(c) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual and the company, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the individual’s request; or</p>
