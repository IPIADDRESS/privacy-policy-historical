<h3>Crescendo Networks Email Marketing Communication Policy</h3>

<p>We process your Personal Data only for specific and limited purposes. We ask only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. When we ask you for Personal Data, we tell you the purposes for which we will process that data. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some of these purposes include the following:<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may contact you occasionally to inform you of new services we will be providing, or special offers, events or articles we think will be of interest to you. <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may send you regular updates by e-mail or by post on Crescendo Networks organized or related events. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>We do not share, sell or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third parties, except under these limited circumstances:</p>
<p><br>
Personal Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for or on behalf of Crescendo Networks, or in connection with the business of Crescendo Networks for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to handle our mailings on our behalf.<br>
<br>
We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this Web Site, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. <br>
<br>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
