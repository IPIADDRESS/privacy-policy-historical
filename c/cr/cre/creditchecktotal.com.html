      <p><strong>WHAT IS OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU?</strong><br>

</p><ul>
<li>

<li>Billing information, such as credit card number, is required to process the payment for the products and services you order from us.</li>

E-mail addresses are collected and used to send you notifications, special offers and our latest e-newsletter via electronic mail.</li>
</ul>
We will also collect certain information arising out of your use of our web site, or augment the data we collect with other information from other online or offline sources.  We reserve the right to collect information about you and store it in connection with other online or offline information we may possess or obtain about you.<p></p>

<p><strong>DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?</strong><br> 
</p><p>
<strong>We do not share information with any non-affiliated third party except:</strong> (1) in select circumstances when a business partner refers you to us and you give us permission to share specific information, such as your name and email address, with that business partner on your order form, or (2) as permitted or required by law, such as inquires by law enforcement or to comply with Federal laws such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003) or the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA). </p>
<p>If you choose, we may disclose the information that we collect to our affiliated companies from time to time for marketing purposes and to enhance our products and services to better suit your needs. When identifying methods of improving our products and services or if we think a product may be of interest to you, we may arrange to extend select special offers of goods or services to you either directly or through affiliates. If you would like to opt-out of having your information shared with partners and/or affiliates, please refer to the section labeled "Offering You Choices - Marketing Options," below.</p>
<p>In order to provide the products you have requested, we may disclose the information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf such as the credit reporting agencies from which we obtain your credit report(s), credit card processors, e-mail communications management firms or call center providers. Our third party service providers are contractually limited to using the information received from ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. solely for the purposes of providing you with the services you requested.</p>
<p>Our Sites may contain links for other offers and services that we feel you may have an interest in. We believe these sites share a similar commitment to consumer privacy and urge you to review their privacy policy when visiting their sites. We cannot, however, be responsible for their privacy practices.</p>

<li>Affiliate sharing Opt-out Options: While placing an order for the purchase of a credit report or monitoring service, you may select to opt-out of receiving offers from our affiliated companies directly on your order form.

<p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br>
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those of our employees who need to know that information in order to provide products to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect your nonpublic personal information.</p>
<p>ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. protects your information over the Internet by using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs (Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with our web server via an encrypted session. We employ a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and ConsumerInfo.com, Inc. The 128 bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cyphertext to safeguard sensitive information during its journey across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination. Depending on which browser you use, you will know you are in secured area by "https" or a lock appearing in the lower right hand corner of your browser window. When you visit our Sites, you may move in and out of secured areas. Any time that you are on an order page or viewing your personal credit report, you will be in a secured area.</p>
<p><strong>
TRANSFERABILITY OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or portion of our assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by means of notice on our Sites for thirty (30) days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
