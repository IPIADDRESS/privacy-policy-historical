            <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">

                <li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
                <li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>
                <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>
                <li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise, and the resources that you access.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>IP addresses and cookies</strong></p>

            <p>We may collect information about your computer, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
            <p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

                <li>To recognise you when you return to our site.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site and the settings on your browser will be confirmation of your acceptance.</p>

            <p><strong>Where we store your personal data</strong></p>

            <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things,  the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.</p> By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.<p></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
