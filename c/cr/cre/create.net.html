            <p><strong>IP addresses and cookies</strong></p>

            <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
            <p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.
