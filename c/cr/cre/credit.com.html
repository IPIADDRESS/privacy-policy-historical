     <p>Credit.com is dedicated to protecting the privacy of our customers. </p>
<p>Credit.com Inc. has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software.  The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, www.credit.com.</p>

      <h3>What information we collect and how we collect it.<a name="1"></a></h3>
      <p>
	  We collect the following categories of NPPI: (i) information you provide such as your contact information; (ii) information about your transactions with us or our affiliates; (iii) information about your transactions with non-affiliated third-parties to whom your information is disclosed by us to fulfill a transaction you request, such as obtaining a personal loan or credit card; and (iv) information obtained from any consumer reporting agency, such as your credit history.</p>
      <p><a name="2"></a></p>
      <h3>Traffic data</h3>
      <p>We automatically track and collect traffic data. Traffic data is information that does not identify you personally but may include your IP address, ISP and other similar types of information that help us administer our site, and improve our service offerings. We use cookies and web-beacons to track traffic data and customer transactions for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>No NPPI information that identifies a customer or former customer is revealed in the collection and use of traffic data. Consequently, we do not adjust or alter our website's automatic tracking and data collection in response to a Do Not Track signal or request. We believe we can offer customers a more personalized experience when visiting our website when we are able to retrieve data from a customer's previous activity on our website. We do share anonymous traffic and transactional information with our affiliates and service providers on an aggregate basis for marketing, accounting and site-optimization purposes.

        <p>
            (ii) To affiliates and service providers who perform professional services for us, such as demographic analysis for marketing purposes and accounting or to assist us with marketing, advertising, product/service offerings and customer service fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use your NPPI only as necessary to provide these services to us. For example, we may provide your contact information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters or to provide you with notifications of our product/service offerings via email, phone or text message.
	    </p>
      </blockquote>
	  <p>
       Selected NPPI, such as your Social Security number, driver's license number, bank account or routing number, and debit or credit card numbers, expiration dates and security codes are immediately encrypted.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>What choices you have regarding the use of your information</h3>
      <p>
	  <strong>E-mail correspondence.</strong> You may opt-out of e-mails in one of two ways:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">

        <li>Click on the ‘unsubscribe hyperlink’ in the e-mail you receive.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	  When you unsubscribe, you will receive an e-mail confirming your decision to opt-out.
	  </p>
	  <p>
       <strong>Confirmations.</strong> You may not opt-out of these e-mail messages. They are designed to confirm your identity and your decision to enter into a transaction. Confirmation emails often contain important instructions about your transaction. If you do not wish to receive this confirmation e-mail do not sign up for services or products on this website.

Information entered on the Credit.com website will be automatically updated each time you apply for a new or different service.  In addition, we will deactivate your account when you send such a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@credit.com">privacy@credit.com</a>.  Please note that deactivation of your account will not necessarily result in the deletion of your NPPI.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and otherwise in accordance with our standard archival practices.

      <h3>Privacy policies and non-affiliated third-parties</h3>
      <p>We do not permit third parties to collect NPPI on our website, but our website does include links to third-party websites, services and products, and when you link to a third-party website, the third-party website's privacy policy applies. In addition, you authorize us to provide your NPPI to non-affiliated third parties when you request a financial product or service offered by a third party.
</p>
      <p>Because this privacy policy applies only to the Credit.com website it may be different than that of the non-affiliated third-parties to whom your NPPI is disclosed to process the financial product or service you request or authorize.

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Credit.com is a VeriSign® secured website and uses a VeriSign® SSL Certificate for encryption. Customer data is securely transmitted by Credit.com to non-affiliated third-parties as permitted by this privacy policy or by law and to service providers through a combination of encryption techniques and other privacy protection measures. Selected NPPI submitted through the Credit.com website such as your Social Security number, drivers license number, bank account or routing number, and debt or credit card numbers, expiration dates are encrypted.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Credit.com also maintains and enforces strict internal policies to protect NPPI from unauthorized access by employees or third-parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@credit.com">privacy@credit.com</a>.

      <h3>Terms Used in This Statement</h3>
	  <br>
      <h4>Cookies<a name="18"></a></h4>
      <p>Credit.com uses cookies, or small text files maintained by your web browser, to enhance your interaction with the website. Some cookies are stored on your hard drive. You may reject or refuse cookies and still visit our web site. However if you reject cookies you may not be able to access all of the services on our web site.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Some of the companies that offer products or services via our web sites, and some of the companies that send visitors to our web site pass cookies to your computer. Please be aware that we have no control over cookies passed to you from other companies' sites.
	  </p>
		<p>
If you request information or purchase a product or service, you will be requested to enter NPPI on our web site. Selected NPPI is linked to the cookie stored on your computer so it will be easier for you to complete a transaction on your next visit to our web site. If you complete another transaction, you may have to re-enter selected NPPI which is not linked to cookies stored on your computer.
	</p>
      <p><a name="19" id="19"></a></p>
      <h4>Encryption</h4>
      <p>
	  Credit.com uses encryption to secure selected NPPI such as Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, and credit card data. Encryption is a way to scramble data to make it unreadable to anyone other than the intended recipient. If it is intercepted by a third-party while traveling over a network it cannot be read. Only the persons sending and receiving the encrypted data have a key to unscramble the data and make it readable. Encryption provides privacy for email, discussion group postings, and other communications as they move over networks. Credit.com uses industry standard SSL, AES and RSA encryption.
	  </p>
      <p><a name="20" id="20"></a></p>
      <h4>Secure Sockets Layer</h4>
      <p>
	  Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard method for protecting web site communications by encrypting information thus making it unreadable to anyone except the holders of the keys used to read the information. Credit.com uses the SSL protocol to capture selected NPPI, such as your credit card numbers via the Internet.
	  </p>
      <p><a name="21" id="21"></a></p>
      <h4>SSL Certificate</h4>
      <p>
	  A SSL Certificate binds an entity to a pair of electronic keys that can be used to encrypt and sign digital information. A SSL Certificate makes it possible for you to verify that we have the right to use a given key, helping to prevent others from using phony keys to impersonate us. For more information about our certificate, click on the VeriSign® logo.
	  </p>
      <p><a name="22" id="22"></a></p>
      <h4>Third Data Sources</h4>
      <p> We use third-parties to verify the integrity of selected NPPI you provide so we can confirm your identity. </p>
      <p><a name="23" id="23"></a></p>
      
<h4>Web-beacons</h4>
      <p>
	  A web beacons is a tracking marker that is placed within a web page or in an e-mail message. Web beacons are invisible to your eye, and are used to monitor a computer which is accessing a particular web page or e-mail message and transfer the data to a server. Credit.com uses web beacons to:
	  </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Count website visits to  specific areas at the Credit.com website;</li>
        <li>Track and account for transactional information on the websites of non-affiliated third-parties or service providers;</li>
        <li>Collect aggregate transactional data for accounting purposes;</li>
        <li>Track statistics about:
	        <ul type="circle">
	          <li>The IP address of the computer that fetched the web beacon</li>
	          <li>The URL of the page that the web Beacon is located on</li>
	          <li>The URL of the web beacon</li>
	          <li>The time the web beacon was viewed</li>
	          <li>The type of browser that fetched the web beacon image</li>
	          <li>A previously set cookie value</li>
	        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>


      <h4>Behavioral Targeting</h4>
<p>We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
