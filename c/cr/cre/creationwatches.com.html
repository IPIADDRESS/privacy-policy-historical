<p>All such data collected is automatically deleted when it is no longer required.</p>

<p><strong>1.2. Justification, implementation and / or termination of a contract</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.2.1. Data processing on conclusion of the contract</strong></p>
<p>If you register with Redsol Pte Ltd.  or one of our Apps, or buy a product from our website, we will process the data necessary to successfully conclude the transaction. This includes:<br>
• Full name<br>
• Billing address<br>
• Delivery address<br>
• E-mail address<br>
• Billing and payment data<br>
• Telephone number</p>
<p>The legal basis for collecting the above information is Article 6 (1) (a) and (b) GDPR.</p>
<p>So long as we do not use your data for advertising purposes (see below 1.3.), 1e store the data collected for the execution of the purchase. The duration of such storage is dictated by necessity e.g. statutory or potential contractual warranty and guarantee rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after expiry of above period, information is retained to fulfil our legal obligation to the commercial and tax laws.</p>
<p>To process a purchase a product via our websites / app, the following additional data processing is required:</p>
<p>Your payment data will be encrypted and securely passed on to our payment service providers for processing of your payment. Information such as your delivery address, email and telephone number is passed on to our logistics and shipping partners so that they can send you (and us) intimation once the product is shipped and expected date of delivery.</p>
<p>The logistics partner(s) may contact you to ascertain suitable time of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>1.2.2. Creditworthiness and transmission to credit bureaus</strong></p>
<p>Redsol Pte Ltd. generally grants its customers the option of purchasing goods using insecure payment methods.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there are two types of payment mechanism offered:<br>
Secure, online and,<br>
Non-secure offline</p>
<p>To protect our business interests, Redsol Pte Ltd.  might in certain instances, check the creditworthiness of its customer before granting the option of using insecure payment methods.</p>
<p>Within this framework, Redsol Pte Ltd.  is entitled to use negative credit information, which it has collected for the respective customer. Furthermore, Redsol Pte Ltd.  is entitled to provide negative credit information about the respective customer to the other business associates of Redsol Pte Ltd. This is done in order to minimize the prospect of losses on account of fraud.</p>

<p>In cases where a customer opts to use insecure means of payment, Redsol Pte Ltd.  is entitled to use credit information obtained in the order to calculate probability of non-payment and fraud. This calculation is done via internal scoring and is based on a recognized mathematical statistical procedure. In particular, the data used in internal scoring results from a combination of the following data categories: address data, age, desired payment terms, order path, and assortment groups. As part of the internal scoring, only such data are used, which the customer has indicated to us. As part of the examination of whether an insecure payment method can be granted, we are also entitled to obtain credit information about you from an external credit agency. 
For the purpose of soliciting credit information, the following information is transmitted to the external credit reporting agency: first name, last name, postal address, date of birth.</p>
<p>As part of the credit check, we can decide by means of an automated process whether you are granted the desired insecure payment method (instalment / invoice payment). For example, when submitting a negative credit report by an information agency or when calculating an insufficient score within the scope of the internal scoring, a rejection of the desired payment method can be carried out automatically. You can assert the right for us to make a manual review of the automated decision. In addition, you have the right to make your own views and to challenge the decision.</p>
<p>The processing of your data as part of the credit check is carried out on the basis of Article 6 (1) (b) DSGVO and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. In principle, we have a legitimate interest in the execution of a credit check when selecting an insecure payment method (instalment / invoice purchase) by you.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.3. Use of data for fraud prevention purposes</strong></p>
<p>The information you provide in the context of an order can be used to verify that there is an atypical ordering process (for example, simultaneous ordering of a large number of goods to the same address using different customer accounts). In principle, there is a legitimate interest in the performance of such a review. The legal basis of the processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.4. Transmission of data to transport</strong></p>
<p>Service providers for the purpose of delivering ordered goods, we work together with logistics service providers / transport companies and / or shipping partners: to these the following data may be transmitted for the purpose of delivering the ordered goods or for their announcement: first name, last name, postal address, E-mail address, telephone number (e.g. for forwarding announcements). The legal basis of the processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.</p>



<p><strong>1.2.5. Transmission of data on outstanding claims to collection service providers</strong></p>
<p>If you fail to settle outstanding invoices / instalments despite a repeated reminder, we may forward the data required for the performance of collection to a debt collection agency for the purpose of fiduciary collection. Alternatively, we can sell the outstanding claims to a debt collection agency. He then becomes the debtor and claims in his own name. Redsol Pte Ltd. may cooperate with contracted debt collection service provider. The legal basis for the transfer of data in the context of fiduciary collection is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR; the transmission of data in connection with the sale of receivables is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.6. Transmission of data to partner companies</strong></p>
<p>You have the opportunity to use third-party offers on our platform. In these cases, you may conclude a contract directly with our partner to whom the data required for the performance of the contract (eg first name, last name, billing and delivery address, e-mail address, billing and payment data, date of birth, telephone number) are transmitted. Such advantages offered by our partners are recognizable as partner offers. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) (b), (f) GDPR.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.6.2. Items from other sellers</strong></p>
<p>In order to offer our customers an even larger and more attractive selection, Redsol Pte Ltd. cooperates with selected partners who offer their products and services on their own behalf and for their own account at Redsol Pte Ltd. online portal.</p>
<p>If you order a partner article, a contract may only be concluded between you and the partner. When ordering such an article the general terms and conditions and possibly the privacy policy of the partner apply. The general terms and conditions and privacy policy of the partner may in individual cases deviate from the general terms and conditions of Redsol Pte Ltd. . By sending your order or - for example, in the case of processing special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR) by express consent - you accept the privacy policy of the partner. In this case, Redsol Pte Ltd.  is not your contractual partner and, with regard to the processing of the data by the partner, is not responsible for the data protection law.</p>
<p>If you order several articles from different partners and Redsol Pte Ltd. , the respective terms and conditions and privacy policy of each seller apply to each article. Your data necessary for the transaction (first name, name, address, date of birth, telephone number and e-mail address) will be stored by Redsol Pte Ltd. and passed on to our partner for their own fulfilment of the contract. This may use your e-mail address for sending information about your order.</p>

<p><strong>1.3. Data processing for advertising purposes</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.3.1. Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We have a legitimate interest in using your information for marketing purposes. We use the following data for our own marketing and third-party marketing purposes: first name, last name, postal address, year of birth.</p>

<p>In addition, we are entitled to store additional personal data about you in compliance with legal requirements for your own marketing purposes as well as for the marketing purposes of third parties. The aim is to provide you with advertisements oriented solely to your actual or perceived needs, and not to bother you with useless advertising.</p>

<p>A transmission of the added data to third parties does not take place. In addition, Redsol Pte Ltd.  pseudonymizes / anonymizes personal data collected about you for the purpose of using the pseudonymized / anonymized data for its own marketing purposes as well as for marketing purposes of third parties (advertisers).</p>

<p>The pseudonymized / anonymized data can also be used to advertise online individualized, whereby the control of advertising by third party service providers and / or agencies can be done. The legal basis for the use of personal data for marketing purposes is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.2. Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (" Google "), for the purpose of designing and continuously optimizing our websites in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 1 (f) GDPR. Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you.

<p><strong>1.4.4. Google AdWords</strong></p>
<p>Our website uses the Google AdWords service. Google AdWords is an online advertising program provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>

<p>On the one hand we use the remarketing function within the Google AdWords service. The Remarketing feature allows us to show users of our website on other sites within the Google Display Network (on Google itself, so-called "Google Ads" or other websites) advertising based on their interests. For this, the interaction of users on our website is analysed, e.g. which offers the user was interested in, in order to be able to display targeted advertising to users even after visiting our website on other sites. Google stores a number in the browsers of users who visit certain Google services or websites on the Google Display Network. This number, referred to as a "cookie", records the visits of these users. This number is used to uniquely identify a web browser on a particular computer and not to identify a person; personal information will not be stored. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p>
<p>You may disable the use of cookies by Google by following the link below and downloading and installing the plug-in provided there: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline" ;="">www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a></p>

<p><strong>1.4.8.1. Onsite Targeting</strong></p>
<p>Our website uses cookie information to collect and evaluate ad serving optimization information. For example, this information may contain information about which products you have viewed on our websites / applications. The collection and evaluation is done exclusively pseudonym and does not allow us to identify you. In particular, the information will not be matched with personally identifiable information about you. On the basis of the information, we can show you on our site offers that are specifically geared to your interests, as they result from your previous user behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.8.2. Retargeting</strong></p>
<p>We also use retargeting technologies from external service providers, such as the Pixel of Facebook Ireland Limited. Retargeting allows us to make our online offer more interesting to you. In this way, we can specifically target those users of online advertising who have already taken an interest in our shop and our products on the websites of our partners. From studies we know that the display of personalized, interest-based advertising for the Internet user is more interesting than advertising, which has no such personal reference.</p>

<p>For this purpose, a cookie is set, with which interest data are collected using pseudonyms. On the basis of this information, you will be shown interest-based advertisements for our offers on the websites of our partners. No personally identifiable information will be stored and no user profiles will be merged with personally identifiable information about you.</p>

<p>You have the option to enable or disable the collection of data for the purpose of personalized advertising.  A cookie will then be set that permanently prevents the collection of data, unless you select this cookie in your browser or delete it using the "Delete all cookies" function. The contradiction can be repeated at any time.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.9. Advertising partners / third party cookies</strong></p>
<p>We work with advertising partners to make the online offer on our site even more interesting to you. For this purpose, cookies are set by our advertising partners when visiting our site (so-called third-party cookies). In the cookies of our advertising partners information is also stored using pseudonyms about your user behaviour and your interests when visiting our site. Partly also information is recorded, which resulted before the visit of our side on other sides. This information will be used to show you interest-based advertisements of our advertising partners. No personal data will be stored and no user profiles will be merged with personal data.</p>

<p>You can prevent the interest-based advertising of our advertising partners by a corresponding cookie setting in your browser.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.10. Opposition / opt-out option</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the deactivation methods already described, you can generally prevent the described technologies by setting a corresponding cookie in your browser. In addition, you have the option of deactivating preference-based advertising with the help of the preference manager available here.</p>

<p>The security of our customers' data is our top priority. Below we would like to give you some safety instructions.</p>

<p>Beware of so-called phishing and spoofing attempts.</p>

<p>In this scam mesh, unfortunately, the brand Redsol Pte Ltd.  is misused as a supposed sender. Specifically, this means that consumers receive fake emails on behalf of Redsol Pte Ltd. . These e-mails are often based on the Redsol Pte Ltd.  brand layout and may be difficult to distinguish from genuine e-mails from Redsol Pte Ltd.</p>

<p>The fraudsters want to exploit the trust between Redsol Pte Ltd.  and our customers and thereby steal sensitive data (e.g. login, customer information, payment information) or install malicious software (such as viruses or Trojans) on your computer or smartphone.</p>

<p>The creation of these e-mails and the shipping will not be done by Redsol Pte Ltd. , even if our name should be used as sender. Unfortunately, Redsol Pte Ltd.  cannot influence the sending of these illegal e-mails.</p>

<p>Here are some features that help you recognize emails from Redsol Pte Ltd.:<br>

• Redsol Pte Ltd. does not ask you for personal information by e-mail, nor does Redsol Pte Ltd.  ask you for confirmation of personal information via a link in an e-mail.<br>

• You will receive order confirmations and invoices from Redsol Pte Ltd. only for orders that you have actually made.<br>

• Redsol Pte Ltd. only sends e-mails with file attachments if you have requested them explicitly from us (eg operating instructions).<br>

• Mails from Redsol Pte Ltd. should have no spelling and grammatical errors, as they are always proofread before shipping.<br>

</p><p>How to properly handle spam, phishing and spoofing emails:<br>

• We recommend that you delete suspicious emails immediately.<br>

• Never open links and attachments in suspicious emails or disclose personal information.</p>

<p>Our tip and service for you: If you are ever unsure, just send us an e-mail to:  contact@creationwatches.com</p>

 

<p><strong>1.10.6.2. Important Notes on Protecting Your Data</strong></p>
<p>In today's connected world, unauthorized access to personally identifiable information is a reality that individuals and businesses face every day. That's a big challenge without question.</p>

<p>Since privacy is our highest priority, we invest in the security of our systems and constantly monitor them. Because when you buy online at the Website you entrust us with information about yourself. The security of this information is important to us. Since you too can do something to protect against the unauthorized access of third parties to your information, we would like to give you some advice on how to handle your information safely.</p>

<p><strong>How can I protect my personal information?</strong></p>

<p>Basically: Protect your customer account and also your computer, laptop or your mobile device with secure passwords and PIN codes that only you know.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other things I should consider?</strong></p>

<p>If you ever use a publicly accessible computer, always make sure that you log out after your visit to the Website.</p>

<p>If you receive unsolicited e-mails without concrete contact, asking you to provide the Website  passwords or giving details of payment details, please ignore this and contact us immediately at contact@creationwatches.com. We will investigate these incidents.</p>
