<b>overview </b>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and personalised 
experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose. 
creativepool.co.uk is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user 
experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and 
is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. The following reflects our commitment to you. 


<b>information about creativepool.co.uk visitors</b> 
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit, what 
services users access etc. We only use such data in the aggregate, ie. no personal information specific to a 
user will be included. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we 
can continually create a better overall experience for our users. If we share this information it will only be 
in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how creativepool.co.uk users, collectively, use our Site, so 
they may create a better overall experience for you, as well. 


<b>information about you specifically </b>
We will not ever pass on your personal information to any other party without your consent. You are under no 
obligation to agree to have any of your details shared. In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a 
service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as 
name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, bank account details etc. We may use that information to make 
you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site 
changes. You will always be given the opportunity to opt out of such activity. Any additional information we 
collect is purely to help us to make the Site a better user experience for our users, you will be informed at 
every stage why we are collecting data. 


<b>general information disclosure </b>
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to creativepool.co.uk, or any personal information 
that you provide, to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. We may record and share 
depersonalised aggregated information with our partners. If you input your information on a co-branded 
registration page creativepool.co.uk is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives, 
you should check their privacy policy to ensure your data is safe. 


<b>cv's</b>
By signing up with creativepool.co.uk you are required to put your CV online. This means that any registered 
employer will have access to your CV. You have control over how much of your personal contact information is 
available for viewing. A valid email address is the minimum contact information you must display. We use our 
best efforts to grant access to this database only to hiring employers. We are not responsible if some other 
third party evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your CV. You may 
remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the 
database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the 
retention, use, or privacy of CV in these instances. 


<b>reviews</b> 
creativepool.co.uk has an area on the Site where you can submit reviews. Any review that is submitted through 
this area is greatly appreciated and an important way for you to help us make creativepool.co.uk a better site. 
Any review becomes the property of creativepool.co.uk and we reserve the right to use the information as we see 
fit, including using it for marketing of the Site. We also reserve the right to contact you via email as a 
follow up to the information you have left. 


<b>your password</b> 
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. We do not recommend that you disclose 
your creativepool.co.uk password to any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose 
substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions 
taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password or account has been compromised for any reason, you should 
immediately change your password. 

 
<b>accessing, reviewing and changing your personal Information.</b> 
All the personal information you have provided to creativepool.co.uk can be reviewed and edited at any stage 
just by logging on to the Site using your username and password. We offer you the ability to automatically 
review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information 
yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your request because it is very 
difficult for us to authenticate your account manually. You must promptly update your personal information if 
it changes or is inaccurate. Once posted, you may not be able to change or remove any public postings made on 
the Site including our review and forum areas. 


<b>cookies</b>
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site. "Cookies" are small files placed 
on your hard drive that assist us in providing customised services. We also offer certain features that are 
only available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less 
frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies can also help us provide information which we tailor to your 
interests. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive 
at the end of a session using the Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, 
although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to 
re-enter your password more frequently while you are using the Site. 


<b>security</b>
creativepool.co.uk uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal 
identifiable information, including encryption, and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must 
be protected against loss and unauthorised access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such 
data from unauthorised access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not 
exist in may business or on the Internet. 


<b>children</b> 
Our services are not available to children and we ask that persons under the age of 18 do not submit any 
personal information to us. If you are under 18 years old, you cannot use this Site. This is less to do with 
content that is sensitive to younger viewers and more to do with the fact that anyone under 18 is highly 
unlikely to have the skill set required to join 
creativepool.co.uk.


<b>privacy commitment changes</b> 
If we decide to change our privacy commitment for creativepool.co.uk, you will be sent an email outlining any 
changes. We will also update the changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we 
might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or 
concerns about creativepool.co.uk's privacy commitment, please feel free to email us at 
<span class="emp"><a style="color:#9ed216;" href="mailto:privacy@creativepool.co.uk">privacy@creativepool.co.uk</a></span> 

Thank you for using creativepool.co.uk.
