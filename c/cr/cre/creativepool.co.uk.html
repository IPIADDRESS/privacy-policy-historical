<h3>Creativepool Privacy Statement</h3>

Creativepool's Privacy Policy 

Overview
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and personalised experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose. 
creativepool.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. 
We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. The following reflects our commitment to you.


information about creativepool.com visitors
In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit, what services users access etc. We only use such data in the aggregate, ie. no personal information specific to a user will be included. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users. If we share this information it will only be in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how creativepool.com users, collectively, use our Site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.


information about you specifically
We will not ever pass on your personal information to any other party without your consent. You are under no obligation to agree to have any of your details shared. In some instances, such as when you sign up to use a service, enter into a contest, or purchase a product, we may need more specific information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, bank account details etc. We may use that information to make you aware of additional products and services which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. You will always be given the opportunity to opt out of such activity. Any additional information we collect is purely to help us to make the Site a better user experience for our users, you will be informed at every stage why we are collecting data.


General information disclosure
We do not disclose information about your individual visits to creativepool.com, or any personal information that you provide, to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. We may record and share depersonalised aggregated information with our partners. If you input your information on a co-branded registration page creativepool.com is not responsible for the information that the partner company receives, you should check their privacy policy to ensure your data is safe.


CVs
By signing up with creativepool.com you are required to put your CV online. This means that any registered employer will have access to your CV. You have control over how much of your personal contact information is available for viewing. A valid email address is the minimum contact information you must display. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to hiring employers. We are not responsible if some other third party evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your CV. You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of CV in these instances.


Reviews
creativepool.com has an area on the Site where you can submit reviews. Any review that is submitted through this area is greatly appreciated and an important way for you to help us make creativepool.com a better site. Any review becomes the property of creativepool.com and we reserve the right to use the information as we see fit, including using it for marketing of the Site.

If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.

Accessing, reviewing and changing your personal Information.
All the personal information you have provided to creativepool.comk can be reviewed and edited at any stage just by logging on to the Site using your username and password. We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your request because it is very difficult for us to authenticate your account manually. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once posted, you may not be able to change or remove any public postings made on the Site including our review and forum areas.


Cookies
We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customised services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies can also help us provide information which we tailor to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session using the Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently while you are using the Site.


Security
creativepool.com uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including encryption, and where applicable Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorised access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist in any business or on the Internet. The internet is an open system and as such we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You should also be aware that there is a chance that your current employer may also have access to creativepool and therefore be aware of you being on the site. A final note that while every precaution has been by us to ensure the security of your information. Certain information that you provide may become publicly available - this is not our intention - and if highlighted to us we will do our uptmost to ensure that the situation is rectified as quickly and efficiently as possible. Any situation arising from such a scenario - which would only occur due to missuse of the site or a genuine error on our part will incur an aggregate liability for the Company to you for all claims arising from this situation is limited to Â£0.01.


Children
Our services are not available to children and we ask that persons under the age of 18 do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under 18 years old, you cannot use this Site. This is less to do with content that is sensitive to younger viewers and more to do with the fact that anyone under 18 is highly unlikely to have the skill set required to join creativepool.com.


Privacy commitment changes
If we decide to change our privacy commitment for creativepool.com, you will be sent an email outlining any changes. We will also update the changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about creativepool.com's privacy commitment, please feel free to email us at admin@creativepool.co.uk
