We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose.<br></p><p>Our services connect people across the globe to allow for a fully interactive network within the Creative industry.

When using any of our services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This will include any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable laws.
Throughout this Privacy Policy, the terms “we” or “us” refer to Creativepool Ltd (company reg 05707888). Creativepool Ltd is the “Controller” and “Processor” of your information under current data law.<br></p><p>As a website we are constantly improving our services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.

This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. If we do share this information with third parties it will only be in the aggregate, so that our external partners may understand how Creativepool users, collectively, use our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you too.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Information about Creativepool Members</b></u><br>A member of Creativepool is someone who registers on the site and creates a profile for either a Company or as an individual.<br></p><p>You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area.

A valid email address is the minimum contact information you must display. We use our best efforts to grant access to this database only to hiring employers. We are not responsible if some other third party evades security measures and gains access to the database, and, subsequently, your CV/Resume. You may remove your CV/Resume from our searchable database at any time.

Therefore, if your password or account has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. We do not know or store you password, but if you need to reset it you can do so here https://creativepool.com/privacy/.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Accessing, reviewing and changing your personal Information.</b></u><br></p><p>All the personal information you provide to Creativepool can be reviewed and edited at any stage just by logging on to the site using your username and password. We offer you the ability to review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the site and entering in the new information yourself https://creativepool.com/profile/manage/.

Creativepool will provide the data to you within 30 days of your request<br> <br></p><p>You can make any of the above requests by emailing dpo@creativepool.com<br><br></p><p><u><b>Account Closure</b></u><br></p><p>If you choose to close your Creativepool account, your personal data will stop being visible to others on our services immediately. Account information is deleted at the same except as noted below. However your data may still be indexed by search engines such as google and as such some of your information will appear in search results until such time as the search engine provider indexes the page again and updates it’s results.<br></p><p>We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.<br></p><p>Information you have shared with others will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Cookies</b></u><br></p><p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customised services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently while you are using the site. Cookies can also help us provide information which we tailor to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session using the site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently while you are using the site.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Your Device and Location</b></u><br><br></p><p>When you visit or leave our services, we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to next. We also get information about your IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, and/or ISP or your mobile carrier. If you use our services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Security</b></u><br></p><p>We monitor and try to prevent security breaches. <br></p><p>Creativepool implements security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS, encryption, and where applicable Secure Socket Layers. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us.There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorised access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access by users inside and outside the company. <br><br></p><p><u><b>Cross-Border Data Transfers</b></u><br></p><p>We process data both inside and outside of the United Kingdom and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Lawful Bases for Processing</b></u><br></p><p>At any time, you can withdraw consent you have provided by going to https://creativepool.com/privacy/ .<br></p><p>We will collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and “legitimate interests”.<br></p><p>Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@creativepool.com <br><br></p><p><u><b>Children</b></u><br></p><p>Our services are not available to children and we ask that persons under the age of 18 do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under 18 years old, you cannot use this site. This is less to do with content that is sensitive to younger viewers and more to do with the fact that anyone under 18 is highly unlikely to have the skill set required to join Creativepool.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages</b></u><br>
</p><p>Our services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.<br></p><p>When you share an article or a post publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere. Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).<br></p><p>When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Related services</b></u><br></p><p>We share your data across our different services and Creativepool-affiliated entities.<br></p><p>We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our services. We may combine information internally across the different services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our services be more relevant and useful to you and others. <br><br></p><p><u><b>Service Providers</b></u><br></p><p>We may use others to help us with our services.<br></p><p>We use others to help us provide our services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.<br><br></p><p><u><b>Legal Disclosures</b></u><br></p><p>We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.<br></p><p>It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to: <br>(1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; <br>(2) enforce our agreements with you, <br>(3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, <br>(4) protect the security or integrity of our Service (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); <br>or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Creativepool, our Members, personnel, or others. <br></p><p>We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.<br><br>You can find a wealth of information on Privacy and Data Protection on the ICO's website at https://ico.org.uk/</p></div>
