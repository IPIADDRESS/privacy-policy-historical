<h2>II. Provisioning of the Websites and Creation of Logfiles</h2>
<p>The provider of the Websites automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. Such information is needed to establish a connection to the Websites. The processed information is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>browser type and browser version;</li>

<p>The data is also stored in the log files of our system. These data are not stored together with other personal data of the user and is not combined with other data sources.</p>
<p>The legal basis for processing of the data is Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR. The logfiles are processed for technical and administrative purposes of establishing and maintaining a connection in order to guarantee the security and functionality of our Websites and to be able to prosecute any illegal attacks on it if necessary. We reserve the right to review this data at a later date if we become aware of specific indications of illegal use.</p>
<p>Our legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR results from the security interest mentioned and the necessity of a trouble-free provision of our Websites.</p>
<p>Data will be stored until 1 year from the moment of collecting for security reasons.</p>

<h2>III Cookies</h2>
<p>Some websites use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies are used to make our Websites more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser. Cookies contain a characteristic string of characters that allows the browser to be uniquely identified when you return to the Websites.</p>

</ul>
<p>Such data collected by cookies will be pseudonymised through appropriate technical measures. It is therefore no longer possible to assign the data to the calling user. The data is not stored together with other personal data of users.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They will automatically be deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit our Websites.</p>

<h2>VII. Know Your Customer</h2>
<p>On our Websites, we ask users to register by providing personal data in a know your customer process through the third-party software provider Fractal Blockchain GmbH ("Fractal") as a white-label solution. The process is carried out according to the relevant European Union law, notably Directives 2018/843/EU and 2015/849/EU and as well as Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU, and relevant Danish anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing legislation. We obtain this information from you for security and verification purposes to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>Fractal, on our behalf stores and processes the technical information of your device which you use for orders and communication - cell phone, tablet, notebook, personal computer, etc. (e.g. IP address) and login information (e-mail address, password).</p>
<p>Fractal is located in Germany, stores this data in secured servers in the EU and process this information in compliance with the applicable data protection law(s).</p>
<p>For more information, you can reach out to their person responsible for data protection at privacy@fractal.id, for support in the KYC journey support@fractal.id.</p>
<p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 (1)(c) GDPR and necessary for our performance of contract according to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. The participation in the know your customer process and the data processing necessary is essential to carry out pre-contractual measures and to conclude and execute the contract.</p>
<p>We clarify that the provisioning of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations, relevant EU and Danish anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing legislation) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by Fractal. The data subject may be obliged to provide us with personal data when concluding a contract with us. The non-provisioning of the personal data would lead to non-conclusion of contract and subsequently exclude the user from the use of services offered by the Company.</p>

<p>The data is entered into the know your customer input mask, transmitted to Fractal and stored with Fractal. The following data is processed during such process for natural persons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>first name, last name;</li>
    <li>CPR number (for Danish individuals) / ID or passport number;</li>
    <li>place of residence/address;</li>
    <li>verification of address against certain documents;</li>
    <li>photo from copy of ID or passport;</li>
    <li>birth date;</li>
    <li>email address;</li>
    <li>customer as a politically exposed person (PEP);</li>
    <li>origin of funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case the user is a legal entity, the following data is processed during such process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>company registration documentation;</li>
    <li>information on the ultimate beneficial owner, i.e. the natural person ultimately benefiting from the legal entity’s business activity (see information required for natural persons above).</li>
</ul>
<p>As assessed on a case-by-case basis, additional data may be asked of the User.</p>
<p>For all users participating in the know your customer process we only store a reference number provided by Fractal to indicate in our database that you carried out such know your customer process and link back to the data set processed by Fractal.</p>
<p>Data will be deleted as soon as the purpose for which it was collected and processed, and all commercial and tax law retention obligations are fulfilled.</p>

<p>It is possible to contact us via the following email address: info@crypto-bridge.org. The personal data of the user transmitted by email will be stored. Such data will not be passed on to third parties. The data will only be used for the processing of the conversation.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>The storage of data is necessary for communication with you being the legitimate interest in data processing pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. This is the case when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation ends when the circumstances indicate that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified. The additional personal data collected during the sending process will be deleted after the it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.</p>

<h2>IX. Integration Of Third-Party Services And Content</h2>

We make every effort to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address solely for sending the integrated contents. If a third party provider stores your IP address for other purposes, e.g. for statistical purposes, we have no influence on it and cannot provide you with any information in this regard due to a lack of knowledge.</p>
