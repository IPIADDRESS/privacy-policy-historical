      <p><font size="-1">Gmail is a free, search-based webmail service from Google. 
        With its unique search functionality, Gmail makes your mailbox and the rest 
        of the Internet easily accessible. We designed this innovative service with 
        both its usefulness and your privacy in mind. This policy describes the types 
        of personal information we may collect and how we use it to provide Gmail. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By using Gmail, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information 
        as described in this policy. If we make any significant changes to this policy, 
        we will notify you by posting a notice of such changes on the Gmail login 
        page. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">You should know:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <font size="-1"> 
        <li> We collect limited account information and store and maintain your account 
          and email messages on our secure servers. 
        </li><li> We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies 
          you for marketing purposes without your express permission. 
        </li><li> We serve highly relevant ads and other information as part of the service 
          using our unique content-targeting technology. No human reads your email 
          to target ads or related information to you without your consent. 
        </li></font><li><font size="-1"> You can update your account information and preferences at any time. 
        </font> 
      </li></ul>
      <p><font size="-1">To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
        at this time Gmail is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. 
        If you are under 13, please do not use the Gmail service.</font></p>
      <p><b>What types of personal information do we collect and how do we use
          it? </b></p>
      <p><font size="-1"><i>Account information.</i> When you register with Google, 
        we will request some personal information, including your first and last name, 
        a user name (which will be used for your email address) and password to create 
        your account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted 
        form. Just in case you forget your password, we also may ask you to choose 
        a secret question and answer and provide a secondary email address where we 
        can contact you to re-access your Google account. If you already have a Google 
        account, we may ask you for some additional information to enable an email 
        account. <br>
        <br>
        <i>Email contents and usage.</i> The contents of your Gmail account also 
        are stored and maintained on Google servers in order to provide the service. 
        Google's computers process the information in your email for various purposes, 
        including formatting and displaying the information to you, delivering targeted 
        related information (such as advertisements and related links), preventing 
        unsolicited bulk email (spam), backing up your email, and other purposes relating 
        to offering you Gmail.  Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of 
		recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of email may remain on our systems
		 for some time, even after you have deleted messages from your mailbox or after the termination 
        of your account. Google employees do not access the content of any mailboxes 
        unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having 
        technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain 
        our system, or to protect Google or the public. <br>
        <br>
        We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how 
        much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related 
        to your registration and use of Gmail. Information displayed or clicked on 
        in your Gmail account (including UI elements, ads, links, and other information) 
        is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible 
        service to you, such as improving the Gmail user interface, preventing fraud 
        within our advertising system, and better targeting related information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Google will never sell, rent or share your personal information, 
        including your Gmail address or email content, with any third parties for 
        marketing purposes without your express permission.</font></p>
      <p><b>Cookies &amp; log information.</b></p>
      <p><font size="-1"><i>Cookies.</i> A cookie is a small data file that is sent 
        to your computer when you first visit a website. As with most website cookies, 
        our cookies include an identification number that is unique to the computer 
        you are using. This identifier helps us better understand our user base and 
        how they are using our site and services. <br>
        <br>
        When you visit Google and create a Google account, we set and access cookies 
        on your computer. We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as recognizing 
        you when you visit the site, displaying the site according to your chosen 
        user settings for language, and maintaining the security of your account. 
        Google may share cookie information among its other services for the purpose 
        of providing you a better experience. For example, you may use your Gmail 
        account to access other Google services such as Google Groups or Google Answers. 
        We may also use the cookies to collect aggregated information about the use 
        of Gmail to maintain, analyze and improve the service.<br>
        <br>
        We believe our cookies improve the quality of our services. If you prefer, 
        however, you can reset your browser so that it refuses all cookies, or notifies 
        you when a cookie is being sent. Although you will still be able to use some 
        parts of Google, other parts of the site – including Gmail – may 
        not be available if you refuse cookies. <br>
        <br>
        <em>Log information.</em> When you use your Gmail account, we collect certain 
        information (the same information that most web sites log when they are accessed). 
        This information, contained in the "header" of your request to access 
        the Gmail page, usually includes the browser type you used, your Internet 
        Protocol address, and the date and time of day. In addition, we log the unique 
        ID provided by our cookie and the URL of the last site you visited.<br>
        <br>
        As a basic matter, we need this information to help us provide our services 
        to you. For example, we need to validate your identity in order to maintain 
        the security of your mailbox. We also need to know what Internet Protocol 
        address your query came from so we can send the appropriate pages back to 
        you. <br>
        <br>
        In addition, we log this information for internal business purposes. For example, 
        this log information helps us determine how well our services are working 
        so we can continually improve the quality of Gmail. The log information is 
        also important for security, audit, quality improvement, and other internal 
        business purposes. </font></p>
      <p><b>How we deliver targeted content to you.</b></p>
      <p><font size="-1"> We never share your personally identifying information with 
        any advertiser as part of this service, unless you specifically ask us to 
        do so. When you are logged into your Gmail account, Google will display targeted 
        ads and other relevant information based on the content of the email displayed. 
        In a completely automated process, computers process the text in a message 
        and match it to ads or related information in Google's extensive database. 
        No human reads your mail to target ads or other information without your consent. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Advertisers receive a record of the total number of impressions and clicks 
        for each ad. They do not receive any personal information about the person 
        who viewed the ad. If you click on an ad, Google will send a referring URL 
        to the advertiser's site identifying that you are visiting from Gmail. Google 
        does not send personally identifying information to advertisers with the referring 
        URL. Once you are on the advertiser's site, however, the advertiser may collect 
        personal information about you. Google does not control or take responsibility 
        for the privacy policies of other sites. <br>
        <br>
        Google may send you information related to your Gmail account or other Google 
        services. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be 
        given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. </font></p>
      <a name="disclose"></a><p><b>When we may disclose your personal information.</b></p>
      <p><font size="-1">As a standard email protocol, when you send an email from 
        your Gmail account, Gmail includes your email address and user name in the 
        header of the email. Beyond this, we do not disclose your personally identifying 
        information to third parties unless we believe we are required to do so by 
        law or have a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure 
        is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal 
        process or governmental request, (b) enforce the Gmail Terms of Use, including 
        investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise 
        address fraud, security or technical issues (including, without limitation, 
        the filtering of spam), (d) respond to user support requests, or (e) protect 
        the rights, property or safety of Google, its users and the public. </font></p>
      <p><b>Transfer of information.</b></p>
      <p><font size="-1">Personal information collected by Google may be stored and 
        processed in the United States or any other country in which Google Inc. or 
        its agents maintain facilities. By using Gmail, you consent to any such transfer 
        of information outside of your country. <br>
        <br>
        We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of 
        a transfer of ownership of Google, such as acquisition by or merger with another 
        company. In such an event, Google will notify you before information is transferred 
        and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </font></p>
      <p><b>Updating your information.</b></p>
      <p><font size="-1">You can change your Gmail account settings at any time in 
        the "Settings" section of your mailbox. <br>
        <br>
        You can terminate your account at any time, by going to the account information 
        page. We typically deactivate accounts within two business days of such requests. 
        You should be aware, however, that residual copies of information may remain 
        stored on our systems even after the deletion of information or the termination 
        of your account. </font></p>
      <p><b>How does Google safeguard your information?</b></p>
      <p><font size="-1">We pay close attention to security. First, we focus significant 
        time and resources to ensure that user accounts and information are not misused 
        by Google employees. A limited set of employees are authorized to access user 
        accounts, they are educated about the importance of maintaining user privacy, 
        and their access to user accounts is recorded. Our employees are also contractually 
        required to access accounts and log data only for quality, security, audit, 
        and other internal business purposes. Second, we implement technology and 
        procedures to try to make sure that external parties cannot access or modify 
        users’ personal information on our servers. These technologies and procedures 
        include industry standard methods as well as our own proprietary methods. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We hope you will enjoy using Gmail. </font></p>
