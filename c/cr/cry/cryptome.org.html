  John,
  </p><p>
  The e-mail you received is nothing more than a hoax.&nbsp; While the "FROM:"
  box shows it comes from our organization, if you look at the IP header
  information, you will see that it does not come from our organization. None
  of the e-mail is true.&nbsp; We do not have any personal information on anyone
  except those who are members of our organization, and we certainly do not
  keep any form of financial information.&nbsp; In fact, unless you are a member
  of our organization, we do not even have your contact information.&nbsp;
  We have determined that the e-mails used to further this hoax were gathered
  from various websites and spam lists.
  </p><p>
  Regrettably, it is easy to "spoof" someone on the Internet.&nbsp; It is very
  easy for an e-mail message to appear to come from President Bush or Bill
  Gates, when indeed they did not.&nbsp; That is the case here.&nbsp; We are
  in the process of implementing digital signatures for all official e-mails
  to assist in verifying what is legitimate e-mail and what is not.&nbsp; We
  believe the e-mail to be the work of a mentally-deranged individual acting
  without benefit of any ethics or scruples.
  </p><p>
  We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this might have caused
  you.&nbsp; 
  </p><p>
  Best regards,
  </p><p>
  Dorsey Morrow, CISSP<br>
  (ISC)² General Counsel

<p>
The message above may have been forwarded by a disgruntled member of
ISC<sup>2</sup>; Cryptome is not a member of either CISSP or ISC<sup>2</sup>.
</p><p>
This confirms that ISC<sup>2</sup> and CISSP, like
<a href="http://cryptome.org/aid-nia-db.htm">AID-NIA</a> and the TLAs, are
sleazy organizations violating customer trust while operating under guise
of security firms, an all too common deception of anybody selling "security"
and "intelligence" to gullible and fearful customers&nbsp;-- national, personal,
faith-based.
</p><p>
More vile behavior of CISSP from an insider:
</p><blockquote>
  <a href="http://cryptome.org/cissp-who.htm">http://cryptome.org/cissp-who.htm</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
And ISC<sup>2</sup>'s response:
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
See also recent US government intiative to combine all its databases in the
name of homeland security but more likely to be used for profitmaking by
the privatizing beneficiaries who operate the government's information systems:

</blockquote>
<p>
Don't believe privacy policy statements; none are trustworthy, for they are
deceptive cloaks of insecure systems. The stronger the privacy statement
the weaker the security of the information. The greater the claims of national
security the weaker the nation's protection. When national security providers
promise, "we welcome an investigation, which will show no failure," they
mean "we have you in our databases, fear's our product, pay and pray we won't
betray."

</p><p>
Dear Mr. Baratta,
</p><p>
A so-called "legal notice" has been sent to me with your return address on
it. This notice appears to be a fraud for I have had nothing to do with your
organization and have not given permission for your organization to gather
or sell my personal information.
</p><p>
The same notice has been sent to numerous persons over the pass several months
and none of the persons know what to make of its claims and inaccuracies.
</p><p>
The message may be a forgery and if so you should be aware that the notice
is damaging the reputation of ISC2 and you by its fraudulent intentions.
</p><p>
We have published the notice, other comments on it and this message at:

  </p><p>
  Greetings All.
  </p><p>
  I forward the message below as a warning to all. It has nothing to do with
  Rootsweb but in my opinion is another scam that unfortunately many unsuspecting
  recipients may succumb to. Despite the subject line I do not see this message
  as being a valid legal notice.
  </p><p>
  While they state they have sold my information I have given them no permission
  to either collect information to me, nor to sell that information to any
  third parties.
  </p><p>
  There is an impressive website at the address given but I still believe this
  to be a scam and would warn everyone not to send these jerks one penny.
  </p><p>
  Although the message gives a US mailing address I have no idea of what legal
  body a complaint regarding this might be sent to. If anyone else does feel
  free to forward this message to them.
  </p><p>
  Happy Hunting.

Privacy Policy</font>
</p><p>
The International Information Systems Security Certifications Consortium,
Inc.
[<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr>] has
created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment
to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination
practices for this website: www.isc2.org.
</p><p>
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> uses
your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer
our website.
</p><p>
This site contains links to other sites; www.isc2.org is not responsible
for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
</p><p>
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> does
not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except
when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary
basis. For example, such personally identifiable information may be gathered
from services and in connection with CISSP or SSCP Directory submissions,
CISSP or SSCP Forum submissions, CPE submissions, Item Writing requests and
other requests for information.
</p><p>
As
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> is an
organization based in the United States your personal data will be transferred
to and processed in the United States by
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> and third
parties acting on its behalf in accordance with and for the purposes set
out in this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish your personal data to be
transferred in this way, please inform us using the contact details below.
<b>Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold
or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval
of the user.</b> Regardless of any opt-out by the user,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> reserves
the right to contact such user regarding changes to matters relevant to the
underlying service and or/the information collected.
</p><p>
In some cases, such as the request to download online Study Guides,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> does
require the collection of home address and telephone numbers. It has been
our experience that residential contact information is more constant than
business contact information because of the mobility of professionals through
their careers. This information is used to contact individuals about upcoming
examinations and training seminars.
</p><p>
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> reserves
the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics
in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site.
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> will
provide only aggregated data from analyses to affiliated third parties.
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> is not
responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should
check the applicable privacy policy of such a party when providing personally
identifiable information.
</p><p>
Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose
personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, email address) on the
CISSP or SSCP Directory for the
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> sites,
that such information, along with any substantive information disclosed in
the directory, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties
and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.
Such activities are beyond the control of
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr>.
</p><p>
<b>Affiliated Third Parties</b><br>
Occasionally,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> contracts
and collaborates with third parties in order to provide services to CISSPs,
SSCPs, and candidates. From time to time,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> collaborates
with other security organizations and associations to promote its programs
as well as the programs of other organizations and associations. In such
cases,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> may provide
these organizations and associations with mailing information. Affiliated
third parties include those who have a contractual relationship with
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> and are
engaged in the training and education of Information Security (i.e. MISTI,
CSI,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> Institute),
sale of Information Security educational literature (Auerbach press), the
general promotion of Information Security (Information Systems Security
Association), or who provide direct support services to
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> (Schroeder
Measurement Technologies, Inc.)
</p><p>
<b>Other Data Collection</b><br>
Users should also be aware that non-personal information and data may be
automatically collected through the standard operation of
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr>'s Internet
servers or through the use of 'cookies.' Please click here for more information

</p><p>
<b>Opt Out</b><br>
Upon request,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> will
allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts at any time.
Additionally, upon request,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> will
use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information
previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such
activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon
a user's request,
<nobr>(ISC)<font style="font-size: 10px"><sup>2</sup></font></nobr> will
use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his
or her personal information from its database. However, it may be impossible
to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups
and records of deletions.
