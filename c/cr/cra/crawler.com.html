<h1>WEBSITE AND SERVICES PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p><b>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY USING ANY OF THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</b> </p>

At Crawler, we care about providing you with the tools and information to manage and protect your online privacy. We have therefore developed a policy to inform you about the types of information Crawler collects and what measures we have in place to protect that information. <br><br>

While we have made every attempt to make this policy as clear as possible, if you have any questions about this policy, contact us at:<br><br>

<b>THESE SERVICES ARE INTENDED FOR ADULTS ONLY.
CRAWLER INTENDS ITS SERVICES TO BE USED ONLY BY ADULTS. CRAWLER EXPRESSLY HAS NO INTEREST IN MARKETING THE SERVICES TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 13. </b><br><br>

<b>Information Collection</b><br><br>

If you visit the Crawler Web sites, performance and usage information (such as search term, time of day, browser type, default language setting, IP address, an anonymous unique ID, and a code which identifies the distribution source of the Software) will be transmitted to Crawler for evaluating both the Crawler Toolbar and the Crawler search services associated with it. This information will not personally identify you. If the search query is being generated as a result of a misspelled URL or search terms entered into the browser address bar, we also receive the misspelled URL address or search term.
<br><br>
Importantly, all information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. In addition, all information about search activity is evaluated only on an aggregated basis (excepted in response to a customer service inquiry or legal process), and we do not disclose any non-aggregated information to third parties, except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect someone's safety. 
<br><br>
Some of Crawler services require registration in order to create an account. The registration information typically asked for includes your name, email address and account password. This information is necessary to initiate as well as continually use the account. If personally identifiable information is required, we will inform you of the type of information collected and how it will be used. 
<br><br>

<b>About Cookies</b><br><br>

Cookies are small files that contain information that a Website uses for tracking purposes. Crawler uses cookies to track trends and patterns of how people search. This information helps us with improving the quality of our service to you. You can reset your browser to control cookies, however, Crawler may not function properly if cookies are refused.
<br><br>

<b>Sharing Information</b><br><br>

Crawler does not attempt to determine the identity of its users or correlate their email addresses with their Web usage paths or shopping information. Except as described below, Crawler does not intentionally disclose personally identifying information collected by our services to any third party without your consent. We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
We disclose any information we possess in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and such information might be used by the receiving party to determine your identity, your Web usage and online shopping behavior, or other things about you.
<br><br>
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as technical support services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to Crawler's databases and servers, which may contain personally identifying information about users. These parties are obliged to use the information according to our instructions and they are bound to this Privacy Policy and must apply appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
<br><br>
Any personally identifiable information that you provided in a Crawler account may be shared among all our services so that we can improve our services to you. We will not provide your account information to any third party except as described in this Policy or with your consent. By using Crawler services, you are consenting to the transfer of your information where it may be stored and processed by Crawler, LLC and its agents in facilities maintained in the United States and/or other countries. If Crawler, LLC ever experiences a transfer of ownership, personally identifiable information can be subject to a different privacy policy. If this is the case, there will be notification prior to any personally identifiable information being transferred. Crawler aggregates and analyzes the information it collects to improve its service and to prepare reports about aggregate web usage and shopping habits. Crawler may share aggregated information with others. An example of this would be the number of users who used a specific search term. 
<br><br>

<b>Security Measures</b><br><br>

We are committed to protecting the security of your personally identifiable information. Access to your information may be necessary and is restricted to those employees who need it in order to provide the service or for service development and improvement purposes. 

<br><br>Crawler uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data. These risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and Crawler therefore cannot guarantee complete security.
<br><br>
<b>Making Changes or Opting Out</b><br><br>

You may change to or opt out of having your personally identifiable information collected by Crawler at any time. Our services provide a means for updating your personally identifiable information, see the help pages for each service or you can make a request via email to <script type="text/javascript">document.write('<a href="mailto:contac' + 't@crawler.com">cont' + 'act</a>') </script><a href="mailto:contact@crawler.com">contact</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Website Links</b><br><br>

The Web changes constantly, and no technique can ever index all pages accessible on the Web. As a result, Crawler cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the websites or URLs to which Crawler's Service link or refer. The process of including websites in Crawler's Service is largely automatic. Crawler does not screen the websites included in the service, and these other websites are maintained by persons over whom Crawler exercises no control. 
<br><br>
For these reasons, Crawler assumes no responsibility for the content of any Website or URL included in the service and is not responsible for errors or omissions or for offensive or objectionable content contained on any Website or URL included in the service. These sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collecting data or soliciting personal information.
<br><br>

<b>Policy Changes</b><br><br>

Crawler may change this Privacy Policy at any time at its sole discretion. Notice of material changes to this Policy will be posted on Crawler’s Website or on the service before they become effective. You are responsible for reviewing the notice and any applicable changes.
