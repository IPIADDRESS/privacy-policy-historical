</p>
<h4>Information Collected Through Technology</h4>
<p>
	In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Taunton Applications ("Usage Information").  This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the Taunton Applications, all of the areas within the Taunton Applications that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use the this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Taunton Applications.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for your computer or other device used to access the Taunton Applications (any, a "Device").  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the Taunton Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.
</p>
<p>
	A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following: 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies.</strong>  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Site.  Cookies are stored on users' hard drives.  We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies."  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next.  Flash cookies, known as  local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Site may not function properly  For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to sign into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.  
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Web Beacons.</strong>  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.  
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong>  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Taunton Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>HTML5.</strong> We use HTML5 in the Taunton Press apps and mobile website for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser "cookies" file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.  
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Web Logs.</strong>  Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Taunton Applications.  We may track your movement within the Taunton Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types.  This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Taunton Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our Taunton Applications and usage and browsing habits.  We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Taunton Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.  We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications. 
</p>
<h4>Information You Provide About a Third Party </h4>
<p>
	If you send someone else a communication from the Taunton Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a subscriber to our publications, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Taunton Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
</p>
<h4>Information We Collect From Third Parties</h4>
<p>
	We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
</p>
<h4>Third Party Analytics Technologies</h4>
<p>
	We use third parties' analytic and other tools to better understand who is using the Taunton Applications, how people are using the Taunton Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the Taunton Applications and its content, and to help us serve more targeted content and advertising to you.  Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Taunton Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system and browser used and other web sites you may have visited.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices.  If you would like more information regarding which third party companies we use to provide these services who may be serving cookies or other tracking tools on our Taunton Applications or want to know more about your choices about not having this anonymous collected or used by these companies, <a href="#partners">please click here</a>.

	<strong>Third Party Advertising.</strong>  We also use third-party ad servers and ad networks to serve advertisements when you visit the Sites.  These companies and the advertisers themselves may use information about your visits on other web sites and our Sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  In the course of serving advertisements to our Sites, these third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the Sites.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of any advertisers on our Sites to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices.

</p>
<p>
	<strong>Your California Privacy Rights (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong><br>
	California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.  If you do not want us to send you emails regarding special promotions or offers or share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you emails about their products and services, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions that are located at the bottom of those emails or you can click <a href="http://reg.e.taunton.com/regp?aid=712205674&amp;n=2015" target="_blank">here</a> to manage your email marketing preferences.  If you do not want us to send you any offers from third parties through direct mail or share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you direct mail offers about their products and services, please write to us at the street address set forth at the end of this document or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@taunton.com">privacy@taunton.com</a>..  California customers may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to us at the address provided in the "Contact Us" section.
