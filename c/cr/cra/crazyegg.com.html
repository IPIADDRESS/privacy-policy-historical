<h1>Crazy Egg Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>At Crazy Egg we recognize that your privacy is important. We value your trust and confidence and are firmly committed to protecting the privacy of our clients and visitors to our website. Crazy Egg is equally committed to protecting the privacy of the information that it gathers. In particular, we want you to know that Crazy Egg is not in the business of selling or renting individuals' personal data to other companies for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The following documents describe the privacy practices of Crazy Egg. Below you can find detailed information on when and why we collect personal information, how we use it and the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others. We have provided information on how Crazy Egg handles the information it gathers about visitors to sites tracked by Crazy Egg ("Visitor Information") as well as the information it gathers from Crazy Egg clients who visit <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com">www.crazyegg.com</a> and use Crazy Egg to track their website ("Client Information").</p>
<p>If you have visited a site that uses Crazy Egg to track how visitors use their websites and would like information on how we use the information gathered, please see: Privacy Policy for Use of Visitor Information.</p>
<p>If you are a Crazy Egg client and would like to know how Crazy Egg uses your personal account information, please see: Privacy Policy for Use of Client Information.</p>

<h3>Crazy Egg Tracks Limited Information About Visitors</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg clients use Crazy Egg to track how visitors to their websites are interacting with their web pages. This way the Crazy Egg client may evaluate and, if necessary, modify its website to improve the functions of its website and ultimately, make it easier for visitors to use. Each Crazy Egg client tells us what types of data it would like us to collect on its behalf. This data may include how visitors navigate around a web page and the most commonly clicked links on a specific web page. Crazy Egg also collects certain technical information, such as the browser version and operating system used by the visitor.</p>
<h3>Crazy Egg Does Not Collect or Share Personal Visitor Information</h3>
<p>You never have to worry about Crazy Egg sharing your personal information with others. When you visit a website that is being tracked by Crazy Egg, none of your personal information, that is, your name, address, phone number or age, is collected by Crazy Egg. Even if you provide this type of information to the website you visit, it is not transferred to Crazy Egg for use in the Crazy Egg analytics process. Since Crazy Egg does not gather any personal information about visitors to its clients' websites, such information is never sold or shared with other individuals or companies.</p>
<h3>Crazy Egg Does Not Disclose Any Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg only shares the information it gathers with the specific client whose website it is tracking. This information is provided to the client in the form of reports and statistics, but never by identifying individual visitors or the behavior of individual visitors. While this information is never shared with third parties, Crazy Egg does reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.</p>
<h3>Crazy Egg Does Not Track Visitors Over Multiple Sites</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg does not collect information about visitor behavior over multiple sites and does not aggregate information from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors across multiple sites.</p>
<h3>Our Clients' Use of Crazy Egg</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg encourages its clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations, as we promise our clients that we will do ourselves. Crazy Egg also recommends that each client obtain all necessary consents from visitors to its website(s), post an online privacy policy that provides each visitor with notice of its data collection and use practices (including the client's use of Crazy Egg), and provide a link to the Crazy Egg privacy policy. Nonetheless, Crazy Egg cannot be held responsible for its client's use of Visitor Information that is not permitted under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Use of Cookies and Other Data Collection Methods</h3>
<p>It is Crazy Egg's policy to use cookies (a small text file that Crazy Egg stores locally on your computer for record-keeping purposes) only for more accurate traffic analysis. The cookie information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address nor does Crazy Egg link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, however, you may set your web browser to reject cookies. For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your privacy settings.</p>
<h3>How Crazy Egg Tracks Visitor Information</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg clients use customized Java script tracking code provided by Crazy Egg to track information about their website visitor's activity. This code contacts Crazy Egg's servers and triggers tracking of your activity while visiting the client website. This information is then stored on the Crazy Egg website for use in performing analysis and producing reports for Crazy Egg clients.</p>
<h3>Opting Out</h3>
<p>As a visitor to a Crazy Egg client site, you can deactivate our client's ability to analyze your web browsing and behavior, which will universally deactivate the ability to capture information about your activity on all Crazy Egg client sites (including the Crazy Egg websites). To opt out of receiving tracking cookies for all sites using Crazy Egg, please contact us at contact@crazyegg.com.</p>
<h3>For More Information</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this policy, our services, or your experience with Crazy Egg, please contact us through our website [email: privacy@crazyegg.com].</p>

<p>Please see the above information regarding Crazy Egg's collection and use of information gathered by Crazy Egg about visitors to clients' websites.</p>
<h3>All Visitor and Client Information is Confidential</h3>
<p>All the statistical information we compile for your website and personal information that we collect about you is considered confidential. Only your authorized agents and users may access this information, which is protected by usernames and passwords. For maximum protection, you should keep your password and username secret. Crazy Egg has implemented industry standard security mechanisms to protect this information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Examples of these security mechanisms include limited access, firewalls and SSL encryption to protect transmission of data. Crazy Egg software is designed to provide effective security. Nonetheless, Crazy Egg cannot be held responsible for unauthorized access to client accounts.</p>
<h3>Crazy Egg Limits Access to Your Information</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg will not access, modify, or otherwise divulge the statistical information we compile for your site except for the express purpose of generating reports which have been authorized by you or otherwise agreed to by you, or unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Crazy Egg; (3) enforce our agreements with clients and visitors; or (4) troubleshoot any service problems.</p>
<h3>No Site-Specific Data is Ever Divulged</h3>
<p>Crazy Egg aggregates certain broad categories of data across all the websites using Crazy Egg, such as Internet browser usage and screen resolution.</p>
<p>[Although it does not currently, in the future Crazy Egg may aggregate clientÃ­s analytic data with the analytic data of other Crazy Egg clients to compile reports regarding web usage in general, which may be provided to third parties. This information is presented only in an aggregate form, and in no event will we compile specific site data that identifies the client or clientÃ­s website visitors without client's permission.]</p>
<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>It is Crazy Egg's policy to use cookies (a small text file that Crazy Egg stores locally on your computer for record-keeping purposes) only for more accurate traffic analysis. The cookie information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address nor does Crazy Egg link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, however, you may set your web browser to reject cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use Crazy Egg. For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Your visitors can also reject cookies. If a visitor sets its browser to reject cookies, then Crazy Egg will consider each visit from that visitor as an unique visit.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>When clients register for use of the Crazy Egg service or for a trial version of Crazy Egg or when clients request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require the client to give us contact information (such as their name and e-mail address), and/or financial information (such as a credit card number). When a client registers for the Crazy Egg service, this personal information is temporarily stored in encrypted format in a session cookie. Crazy Egg never stores such information linked to a permanent cookie. This personal and financial information allows Crazy Egg to process and fulfill your request, register your account, check your qualifications for registration and to bill you for products and services.</p>
<p>Crazy Egg may also use personal information you submit to us for other communications such as to request additional information necessary to process or fulfill your order; to determine if you are satisfied with the Crazy Egg service; to inform you that an upgrade is available; or to contact you with information about Crazy Egg.</p>
<p>Crazy Egg may release personal information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Crazy Egg, our users, or others.</p>
<p>Like many companies that accept payment by credit card, Crazy Egg may share clients' personal information with qualified third parties in order to process your order or perform a credit worthiness check.</p>
<p>With the exception of the limited circumstances discussed above, Crazy Egg does not provide client personal information to third parties for any purpose.</p>
<h3>Access to Personal Information Stored at Crazy Egg</h3>
<p>At any time, a Crazy Egg client may view its personal information that is stored in the Crazy Egg database. If necessary, clients may correct this information by visiting their account preferences section.</p>
<p>Since Crazy Egg does not capture personal Visitor Information, a client will never be able to access individual Visitor Information.</p>
<h3>Opting Out of Use of Personal Client Information for Communications</h3>
<p>Because communications with our clients are necessary to adequately provide our services, clients cannot opt-out of receiving administrative e-mails related to their accounts. Such e-mail may include confirmation of a registration or purchase, or communication during the sales or support process.</p>
<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If Crazy Egg makes any material changes to the way in which it uses personal information, Crazy Egg will notify you by e-mail.</p>
<h3>For More Information</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this policy, our services, or your experience with Crazy Egg, please contact us through our website [email: privacy@crazyegg.com]</p>
<h3>Sample language for Client website:</h3>
<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.</p>
<p>In general, you can browse our website without giving us any personal information. We use Crazy Egg to analyze traffic to this website in order to understand our customer's and visitor's needs and to continually improve our site for them. Crazy Egg collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific visitor.</p>
