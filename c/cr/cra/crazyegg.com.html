		  <h1>Crazy Egg Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
  As used in this policy, "Crazy Egg" refers to all websites (including http://www.crazyegg.com), properties, and services owned or operated by Crazy Egg, Inc.
</p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy is part of Crazy Egg's Terms of Use and describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg.  Below you can find information about when and how we collect information from you or concerning your computer or device ("Information"), including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), how we use such Information, and the circumstances under which we may disclose such Information to others.
</p>
<p>
  By visiting the Crazy Egg website, visiting a Crazy Egg client website that provides notice of its use of Crazy Egg and/or this policy, or registering for our service, you acknowledge that you accept and consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies other than Crazy Egg, or to individuals whom Crazy Egg does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which Crazy Egg may disclose Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>I. INFORMATION OBTAINED WHEN YOU VISIT CRAZY EGG OR OUR CLIENT'S WEBSITES</h2>
<p>
<b>Crazy Egg's Collection and Use of Visitor Information</b><br>
Crazy Egg clients use Crazy Egg's code, software and service ("Service") to obtain information regarding how visitors to their websites are interacting with their web pages ("Visitor Information"). This allows Crazy Egg's clients to evaluate and, if necessary or beneficial, modify its website to improve the functions of its website and make it easier and more valuable for visitors to use. Please note that Crazy Egg itself uses the Crazy Egg Service to obtain insights into visitors' activities on http://www.crazyegg.com.
</p>

<p>
The data Crazy Egg collects may include customized data that varies from client to client but typically includes information about visitors' activities on the client's website, such as how visitors navigate around a web page and the most commonly clicked links on a specific web page.
</p>

<p>
Crazy Egg may also collect certain Information about a visitor's computer that may be furnished by the visitor's browser, such as:
</p><ul>
  <li>Browser Information </li>
  <li>Operating System Information</li>
  <li>Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)</li>
  <li>IP Address</li>
  <li>Page Accessed </li>
  <li>Geographic Location</li>
  <li>Time of Visit</li>
  <li>Referring Site, Application, or Service</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Crazy Egg's Service is not designed to collect Information that could be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address or phone number ("Personally Identifiable Information") when you visit a website that uses the Crazy Egg Service.  However, please be aware that Crazy Egg allows its clients to provide it with customized data that may, depending on the election of the client, contain Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
<b>Crazy Egg Does Not Collect Visitor Information Across Multiple Sites</b><br>
Crazy Egg does not collect or aggregate information about visitor behavior on multiple, different websites.
</p>

<p>
<b>Crazy Egg May Collect Information Contained in the "Referring URL" For The Last Website Visited</b><br>
If a visitor navigates to a website that uses the Crazy Egg Service from another website, Crazy Egg may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the client's website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request.  For example, if a user navigates to a website that uses Crazy Egg from a search engine, such as Google, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the Google search query, such as the terms the visitor was searching for before visiting the Crazy Egg client's website.  Crazy Egg may use information contained in the referring URL to analyze and provide information to its clients about the activities that led users to navigate to the client's website.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Crazy Egg's Disclosure of Visitor Information</b><br>
Except as disclosed in <a href="#section2">Section II below</a>, Crazy Egg never sells or shares any Visitor Information with individuals or companies other than the specific client on whose website Crazy Egg collected the Visitor Information.  
</p>
<p>
This Information is provided to clients in the form of aggregated reports and/or statistics that identify the collective behavior of visitors to the client's website, as opposed to the behavior or activity of specific or identified individuals.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Our Clients' Use of Crazy Egg</b><br>
Crazy Egg encourages its clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Crazy Egg also recommends that each client obtain any necessary consents from visitors to its website(s), post an online privacy policy that provides each visitor with notice of its practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure (including the client's use of Crazy Egg), provide a link to the Crazy Egg Privacy Policy, and provide a link to the <a href="/opt-out">Crazy Egg Opt-out</a>. Nonetheless, Crazy Egg has no control over its clients' activities or the disclosures made by its clients on their websites, and it cannot be held responsible for any client's failure to make these disclosures on its website or its use of Visitor Information that is not permitted under this Privacy Policy or otherwise.  For more details on the terms that apply to our clients' use of the Crazy Egg service, please see <a href="/terms">Crazy Egg's Terms of Use</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
It is Crazy Egg's policy to use first-party cookies (small text files that Crazy Egg stores locally on your computer) on client sites for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify visitors; assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences; diagnose problems with our servers; analyze trends; and otherwise administer Crazy Egg products and services.  Cookies placed by Crazy Egg on the computers of visitors to its clients' websites do not include Personally Identifiable Information such as name, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, nor does Crazy Egg link cookies to such Personally Identifiable Information in its servers or databases.  
</p>

<p>
If you do not wish to have Crazy Egg place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse all cookies, including first-party cookies, before accessing Crazy Egg or other websites that may use Crazy Egg.  Crazy Egg is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings.  Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features of the websites you visit may be unavailable.  In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser settings to reject all cookies, your activity on Crazy Egg client websites will still be recorded by the Service. However, if you reject all cookies, Crazy Egg will not be able to determine whether or not someone using that computer previously visited the website â€“ i.e. whether or not the visitor is a "unique" visitor.
</p>

<p>
For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie settings.  If you do not elect to set your browser preferences to refuse cookies, you consent to have cookies, including first-party cookies used by Crazy Egg, placed on your computer when you visit websites.
</p>

<p>
<b>How Crazy Egg Collects Visitor Information</b><br>
Crazy Egg clients use customized and proprietary JavaScript tracking code provided by Crazy Egg to collect and transmit Visitor Information to Crazy Egg's servers. When a user visits a website that uses Crazy Egg's Service, this code contacts Crazy Egg's servers and enables Crazy Egg to collect and analyze the user's activity while visiting our client's website. This information is then stored on Crazy Egg's web servers and databases for use in performing analysis and producing reports for the Crazy Egg client.
</p>

<p>
<b>Opting Out</b>
If you wish to opt out of Crazy Egg collecting Visitor Information when you visit Crazy Egg client websites, please see the <a href="/opt-out">Crazy Egg Opt-out instructions</a>. Please note that if you use a different computer or Internet browser than you used when opting out of Crazy Egg's Service, Crazy Egg will not be able to view the opt-out and will collect Visitor Information when you visit Crazy Egg client websites.  In these circumstances, you will need to revisit the link above in order to reset your opt-out decision, in order for it to be effective.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Client Information</b><br>
When individuals or companies register to use the Crazy Egg Service, register to use a trial version of Crazy Egg, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require Personally Identifiable Information, such as name, e-mail mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or website to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Information"). When a client registers for the Crazy Egg Service, some of these pieces of information may be temporarily stored in encrypted format in a session cookie (but are never stored or linked to a permanent cookie). Crazy Egg may use this information to process and fulfill your request, register your account, check your qualifications for registration and/or to bill you for products and services.  Crazy Egg may also use Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us to provide Crazy Egg's products and services, personalize and tailor your experience on Crazy Egg, operate our business, understand how clients are engaging with Crazy Egg, request additional information necessary to process or fulfill your order; determine if you are satisfied with the Crazy Egg service; inform you that an upgrade is available; or to contact you with information about Crazy Egg, including information about new or existing products and services or special offers.  For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and services to the email address associated with your account.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disclosure of Client Information to Third Parties</b>
Crazy Egg may disclose Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) collected from or concerning clients or potential clients ("Clients") to third parties in the circumstances described below and in <a href="#section2">Section II of this Privacy Policy</a>.  By registering for or accessing Crazy Egg's products or services, you consent to such disclosure.  This Policy does not apply to the policies or practices of any such third parties.
</p>

<p>
<b>Payment Processors</b><br>
Like many companies that accept payment by credit card, Crazy Egg relies on third-party payment processors to process financial payments, such as Authorize.net.  When you make payments to Crazy Egg to obtain or use Crazy Egg's products or services, Crazy Egg may share Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, address, and credit card information, with qualified third parties in order to process your order.
</p>

<p>With the exception of the limited circumstances discussed above and in Section II, Crazy Egg does not provide Clients' Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for any purpose.</p>

<p>
<b>Access to Personally Identifiable Information Stored at Crazy Egg</b><br>
At any time, a Crazy Egg client may view and/or modify their Personally Identifiable Information stored by Crazy Egg by visiting the account preferences section of their Crazy Egg account, accessible <a href="/account">here</a>.
</p>

<a name="section2"></a>

<h2>II. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO BOTH VISITOR AND CLIENT INFORMATION</h2>

<p>
<b>Disclosure of Visitor Information and Client Information to Service Providers and Law Enforcement/Legal Process</b><br>
nformation and/or Client Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) may be shared with certain third-party companies and individuals that help facilitate technical aspects of the Crazy Egg Service or perform functions related to the administration of Crazy Egg, such as Amazon's Web Services, which provides storage facilities for certain Visitor Information and Client Information collected and analyzed by Crazy Egg.  These third parties perform tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated not to disclose or use Visitor Information or Client Information for any other purpose. However, Crazy Egg is not responsible in the event that Personally Identifiable Information is disclosed at a result of a breach or security lapse at any such third party. 
</p>

<p>Crazy Egg also reserves the right to disclose any Visitor Information or Client Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) enforce, apply, or investigate breaches of the Terms of Use or other agreements; (iii) respond to public requests; or (iv) protect the rights, property, user experience, or safety of Crazy Egg, our employees, our users, or others.</p>

<p>
<b>Security and Protection of Visitor Information and Client Information</b><br>
Crazy Egg has implemented reasonable security mechanisms to protect Visitor Information and Client Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Examples of these security mechanisms include limited and password-protected access, firewalls, and SSL encryption to protect transmission of data. However, please keep in mind that no security system is impenetrable.  It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access Visitor Information and Client Information.  Crazy Egg cannot guarantee the security of such information and cannot be held responsible for unauthorized access to Crazy Egg client accounts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Policy Concerning Children Under Age of 13</b><br>
Crazy Egg does not knowingly or intentionally collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13 or from websites that are directed to children under 13.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Change of Control</b><br>
If Crazy Egg, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by another company or successor entity, Visitor Information and/or Client Information will be one of the assets transferred or acquired by the purchaser or successor.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any purchaser of or successor to Crazy Egg or its assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your information as set forth in this policy.
</p>

<p>
<b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b><br>
Crazy Egg retains the discretion to amend or modify this policy from time to time.  Use and disclosure of Information we obtain is subject to the later of: (1) the policy in effect at the time such Information is collected or (2) any subsequent policy to which you agree or of which you have notice, if you elect to use Crazy Egg or a Crazy Egg client site (including the Crazy Egg website) following such acceptance or notice.  If we make material changes in the way we use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information, we will notify you through one or more of the following means: a direct communication to your Crazy Egg account, a communication to the e-mail address associated with your account, or a clear and prominent announcement on the Crazy Egg website.  Your continued access to or use of Crazy Egg or websites that use Crazy Egg following notice of material changes to this Privacy Policy shall constitute consent to any amendments and/or modifications. 
</p>
