However, if  you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in  the cookies/Web beacons.</p><p>  <b>Managing cookies and Web beacons.</b>  By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies  and Web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other Web  site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent  the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However,  certain areas of our Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be  aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site  features.</p><h2>6. SECURITY</h2><p>  We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard the  information we collect online at the Sites. Despite the reasonable security measure that we have created, we  cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be used or disclosed in a  manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>7.

If the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide you with Thirty  (30) days notice prior to the effectiveness thereof by posting notice of the change in a prominent place on the  Site, such as presenting to you a click-through page immediately following your account login.
