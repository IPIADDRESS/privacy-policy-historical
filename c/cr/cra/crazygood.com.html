	<span style="margin-left: 50px;">&nbsp;</span><b>1.  CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b><br><br>

	Crazygood does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If Crazygood obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Crazygood will immediately delete such information from its database. Because Crazygood does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, Crazygood has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Crazygood has designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Act (COPPA). <br><br>
	
	<span style="margin-left: 50px;">&nbsp;</span><b>2.  INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES </b><br><br>

	<span style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;</span><b>(a) Traffic Data.</b>  Like most website operators, Crazygood automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of devices accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.  <br><br>

	<span style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;</span><b>(b) Cookies.</b>  A "<b>Cookie</b>" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. Crazygood uses Cookies to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the same informational messages repeatedly, and to store Your username so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Website. For additional information on Crazygood' uses of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, below.<br><br>
	
	IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. <br><br>
	
	<span style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;</span><b>(c) Personal Information.</b>  In order for You to use certain of the Services, You are asked to provide Crazygood certain information that personally identifies You ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) "Contact Data" (such as Your name, mailing address and e-mail address); (2) "Demographic Data" (such as Your age, gender, profession, education level, relationship status, religious affiliation, country, state, city and likes and dislikes,); and (3) "Financial Data" (such as Your credit/debit card number and expiration date). In each case, You will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not gather it surreptitiously.  You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to do so may prevent You from using certain of the Services. <br><br>
	 
	CRAZYGOOD DOES NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION. UPON YOUR CANCELLATION OF THE SERVICES, CRAZYGOOD SHALL DELETE FROM CRAZYGOOD'S SYSTEMS ALL OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ANY OTHER FILES OR INFORMATION THAT YOU MADE AVAILABLE TO CRAZYGOOD OR THAT OTHERWISE RELATE TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES. <br><br>

	<span style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;</span><b>(d) Information You Make Public.</b>  The Website contains features (e.g. public profiles, forums, and message boards) that permit You to upload, post, transmit, display, perform or distribute content, information or other, including Your Personal Information. Any information that You choose to disclose by means of such features becomes public information over which Crazygood is unable to exercise control. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Your Personal Information by means of such features, and You agree to assume all responsibility for doing so.   <br><br>

	<span style="margin-left: 50px;">&nbsp;</span><b>3.  INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES</b><br><br>

	<span style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;</span><b>(a) Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies</b><br><br>

By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Crazygood is able to better design the Website to improve Your experience, and to serve You more relevant and interesting content. From time to time, Crazygood may release Traffic Data and information gathered using Cookies in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. Crazygood does not attempt to link information gathered using Cookies to Personal Information.<br><br>

	<span style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;</span><b>(b) Personal Information</b><br><br>
