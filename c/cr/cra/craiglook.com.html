    <h1>User Information</h1>
    Craiglook maintains a database of user information.
    This information is used only by Craiglook to send automated email alerts. None of the information in users database
    is ever provided
    to any third-party.

    <h1>Usage Data</h1>
    All web servers have the ability to automatically collect certain information that a web browser provides. This
    collection ability is commonly referred to as a usage log or a traffic log.<br><br>

    Craiglook's web site collects detail information such as IP address, domain name, browser, date, time and page
