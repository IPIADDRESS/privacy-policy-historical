  <strong><br>

            <br>
            If you  wish to discontinue email correspondence at any time, simply follow the  instructions to “Manage Your Subscription” which appear in every email we send,  or contact us through the Contact Us page.<br>

            <br>
  <strong>COOKIES</strong><br>
            A cookie  is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that  the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user returns.&nbsp; Crane  &amp; Canopy uses cookies to help identify and track users, patterns of usage,  and access preferences.&nbsp; Crane &amp; Canopy also uses temporary “session”  cookies to make sure that you are remembered as you navigate through various  pages of the Site.&nbsp; If you do not want to have cookies placed on your  computer you can set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Site, with  the drawback that certain features of the Site may not function property  without the aid of cookies.<br>
  <strong><br>
  SERVER STATISTICS</strong><br>
            We  collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site.&nbsp; These  statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to access our  Site, page views, and navigational patterns.&nbsp; This type of information  helps us track “where” our users are coming from so that we can target strong  demographic areas and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our  users. In connection with this analysis, Crane &amp; Canopy also uses devices  called “web beacons” to help us identify when emails sent to you have been  received and read. We may also collect IP addresses and other information in  order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the Site.<br>
  <strong><br>
  PROTECTION OF OUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
            We use  reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help us  protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of data stored on our  system. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal  information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the  secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. Except as  specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to  limit access to your personal information to the employees, officers,  third-party contractors, and strategic partners of Crane &amp; Canopy who need  the information in order to perform their duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; While no system  is 100% secure, we believe that the measures we have implemented minimize the  risk of security breach to an appropriate level given the types of information  involved.<br>
  <strong><br>
  HOW WE USE YOUR  INFORMATION</strong><br>
            Crane  &amp; Canopy will use your personal information in an effort to improve your  shopping experience and provide you with information, products or services that  we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; For example, we may share the  personal information you provide to us as well as demographic information and  purchase history we collect with strategic partners, such as suppliers, in  order to select products that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp;  Within that framework, any of our employees, third-party contractors or  strategic partners whom are given access to your personal information will be  contractually obligated to keep such information confidential and to use the information  only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and for us.<br>
            <br>
            Except  as set forth above, Crane &amp; Canopy does not rent or sell personal  information to anyone, including third parties intending to use such  information for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; We may provide aggregate  statistics, which do not include personal information, about our customers,  sales, traffic patterns and related Site information to reputable third party  vendors.&nbsp; We may also disclose personal information we collect from you if  required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is  reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Crane &amp; Canopy,  third parties or the public at large.<br>
  <strong><br>
  INFORMATION POSTED TO  BULLETIN BOARDS, CHAT ROOMS OR OTHER PUBLIC FORUMS</strong><br>
            If you  use a bulletin board, chat room or any other interactive or publicly accessible  area of the Site, you should be aware that any personal information you submit  there can be read, collected or used by any person for any purpose. We are not  responsible for the personally identifiable or other information you choose to  submit in these forums.<br>
  <strong><br>
  EXTERNAL LINKS</strong><br>
            We may  provide links to the websites of other companies through our Site.&nbsp; We are  not responsible for how these other companies collect, use, disclose, or secure  the information that you provide them. If you choose to access a third party  website linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and subject to any terms  of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party websites.<br>
  <strong><br>
  COLLECTION OF INFORMATION  FROM CHILDREN</strong><br>
