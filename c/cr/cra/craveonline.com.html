<strong>Crave Online's Commitment To Privacy</strong>

<p>This policy governs the domains craveonline.com and cravelyrics.com.<br>
<span style="font-size: 10px;">If you catch one of our interns peeking in your windows, that's an entirely separate situation.<br>
That sort of thing would be handled by their parents. Or the authorities.</span>

</p><p>Crave is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. We invite all users to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p><strong>What Crave Does</strong></p>
<p>We operate a content portal that combines the best of entertainment and other interests in one place. We sell advertisements throughout out site on behalf of advertisers.</p>

<p>Crave Promotions: We develop customized online promotional campaigns such as sweepstakes and other incentive-style marketing campaigns.<br>
Crave Mail: Crave operates an e-mail newsletter that it sends to users that have registered to receive it.</p>

<p><strong>How Crave Products and Services Enhance User Privacy and Protect the Property of Advertisers and Web Publishers</strong><br></p>
<p>Crave serves ads throughout our site and those of our partners. The cookies that are employed across our represented websites serve a quantitative function and are not designed to collect and store data profiles on users. They are used to:</p>

<p>
• Report to advertisers and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign;<br>
• Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics;<br>
• Ensure that an advertisement displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination;<br>
• Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; <br>
• Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement;<br>
• Login registered Crave user accounts<br>
• Log anonymous visitors to our site for the purposes of identifying whether a visitor is a unique.
</p>

<p>Destruction timetable:<br>
user cookies ("users_uid") expire one year after the last time the user successfully logged in to their Crave account.<br>
anonymous cookies ("tracking_anonid") expire 6 months from the date of the last visit to Crave.</p>

<p>Crave does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above, nor do we merge personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information, or otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. Non-PII is collected by Crave through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed.</p>

<p>Crave Online Media thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to ad serving.</p>

<p><strong>What User Information Is Collected by Email and Promotions</strong></p>
<p>Crave Online Media collects two types personally identifiable information only through its Email and Promotions business lines.</p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")</strong></p>
<p>PII is personal information classified as personal to the online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. PII also includes other personal information such as birthdate, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information.</p>
<p>Crave's Email and Promotions divisions collect PII on an opt-in basis only. Crave Online Media will not collect any PII unless that user voluntarily provides it to us. If you do not want your personal information collected online, please do not submit it to surveys, promotions, sweepstakes, or subscriptions.PII is collected by Crave Online Media when online users respond to a survey and provide it, when they register for an email newsletter, register for a product or service online, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by Crave, its subsidiaries or its partners. Selected partners of Crave Online Media will share information with Crave Online Media about only their online consumers who have consented to the sharing of their information with third parties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each individual in the Crave Email database has answered positively to an "opt in" question, or they have voluntarily filled out an Internet survey card to receive email solicitation about products of interest. Crave Online Media and its partners communicate with these users frequently to verify their "opt in" status. Crave Online Media also provides users with an explicit opportunity to opt-out every time an email promotion is sent.</p>
<p>In all instances, prior to providing PII information to Crave's Email or Promotions divisions, each online user is given meaningful notice regarding the collection practice and a choice regarding the dissemination of such information. All users are informed about how Crave Online Media and its partners may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to Crave. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide PII or not to have such PII shared with others. Crave Online Media will not share this PII information with any partner company if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information.</p>
<p>Crave Online Media does not collect personal medical information or credit information, or information related to children, except in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>

<p><strong>How Crave Online Media Uses Collected Information</strong></p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is used by Crave Online Media in several ways, as follows:</p>
<p>Promotions and Email divisions use the PII to deliver permission-based direct marketing messages based on a user's expressed interests.</p>
<p>If an online user voluntarily submits its email address to Crave, or one of its partners, online, he or she may receive periodic emails from Crave Online Media with information on new services or products being offered by our company or by one of our partners.</p>
<p>Opting Out From Crave's List of Permissioned Email Addresses</p>
<p>If you are a member of our database and do not wish to receive such mailings, send an email to <a href="mailto:info@craveonline.com">info@craveonline.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>With Whom Collected Information Is Shared</strong></p>
<p>Crave Online Media shares the collected information only as set forth below. Crave Online Media does not sell or transfer the ownership of its PII or Non-PII. Crave Online Media provides its partners only with access to such information on a limited basis. Before any access is shared with a partner, Crave Online Media ensures that such partner publishes and adheres to strict privacy principles regarding the use of such information. Any such use is disclosed to the online user at the time such user submits information.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII): in cases where an online consumer has consented to have their information shared with third parties, Crave Online Media will make access to the information available to selected third party partners in accordance with clearly stated guidelines.</p>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII): Access to Non-PII is shared, in aggregated format, with Crave's Web site and advertiser clients who use the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, future campaign plans, and success of their advertising campaigns. At no time is this non-PII merged with PII. It is useless to any and all parties except as quantifiable data to our advertisers and clients who wish to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.<p></p>

<p>Opting Out From GNM Promotions Database</p>
<p>An online user may request removal of his or her PII information from GNM's Promotions database by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@craveonline.com">info@craveonline.com</a>.</p>
<p>Any consumer who prefers not to provide this information online, can send regular mail to the following address:</p>

<p>Privacy @ Crave Online<br>
12910 Culver Blvd Suite F<br>
Los Angeles, CA 90066</p>

<p>Once a request to opt-out has been received, Crave Online Media will deliver a confirming email message to the user that the user's PII has been successfully opted out of our database. If you do not receive this confirmatory email, then please contact us to ensure that your request was received and processed. </p>

<p><strong>Security and Access to Collected Information</strong></p>
<p>Collection from reliable sources: Crave Online Media collects information only from reliable third party partners that have strict and clearly stated privacy and data collection practices in place.</p>
<p>Protection of collected data: Crave Online Media maintains strict data security systems that ensure specific information will not be made available to any unauthorized person. All collected information is stored on our Web server or database but is not publicly accessible from our Web site. Crave Online Media uses a password protected security system to control access to information stored about its users. Crave Online Media also provides stringent physical security and only provides access to authorized personal.</p>
<p>Dissemination restrictions: Crave Online Media will provide access to collected PII data only to those partners that adhere to fair information practices for lawful, non-discriminatory purposes.</p>
