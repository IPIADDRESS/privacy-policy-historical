                            <h5 class="my-4">7. EXTERNAL LINKS ON WEBSITE </h5>

                            <p>The Website may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources. We have no control over
                            any websites or resources, which are provided by companies or persons other than Us. You acknowledge and agree that We are not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any
                            advertising, services/products or other materials on or available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that We are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 8. OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION </h5>

                            <p>Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to
                            help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. Finally, we may use your IP address to help protect our partners and ourselves from fraud. We will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology
                            becomes available. We will transfer information about you if We are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the site before information about
                            you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.   <br><br>We may release your personal information to a third-party in order to comply with a Court Order or other similar legal procedure, or when we believe in good
                            faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law; prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or violations of Our Terms of Use.
                            We may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with our Copyright Policy as mentioned in the Terms of Use as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation
                            of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, We may disclose name, address, country, phone number, email address and company name.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 9. CONFIDENTIALITY </h5>

                            <p>You further acknowledge that the Website may contain information which is designated confidential by Us and that you shall not disclose such information without our prior written consent. Your information is regarded as confidential and therefore
                            will not be divulged to any third party, unless if legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities. We will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited
                            mail. Any emails sent by us will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 10. OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION </h5>

                            <p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications
                            and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting and foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the
                            government, law enforcement agencies or third parties. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information
                            or private communications would always remain private. As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that
                            your personally identifiable information may be disclosed:   <br><br>
                            a. External Service Providers: There may be a number of services offered by external service providers that help you use our Websites. If you choose to use these optional
                            services, and in the course of doing so, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their private
                            policy.  <br><br>
                            b. Law and Order: We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose
                            any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements,
                            or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 11. ACCESSING AND REVIEWING INFORMATION </h5>

                            <p>Following registration, you can review and change the information you had submitted. If you change any information
                            we may or may not keep track of your old information. You can change your registration information such as: name and email ID. We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain circumstances,
                            such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored
                            ‘back up’ systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 12. CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD. </h5>

                            <p>When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you protect it against unauthorized access of your
                            account and information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out after using our services. You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another
                            Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
                            control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
                            You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of your account or access to your password even after changing it.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 13. OUR INFORMATION COLLECTORS. </h5>

                            <p>Except as otherwise expressly included in
                            this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other sites
                            throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since we do
                            not control the privacy policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 14. SECURITY </h5>

                            <p>We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
                            unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. We do not recommend transfer of sensitive information (such as credit
                            card number) and bank account details via the Site to other Users. Users are recommended to do so offline, on the phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
                            submitted to us, both during transmission and once We receive it. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard security procedures
                            are at your sole risk and discretion.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 16. ADVERTISING </h5>

                            <p>We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services about the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Website and other websites, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, date and time of each visitor request, referring site, browser type, language preference, links clicked and conversion information. The information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Website and other websites and better understand your online activity. We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms.  </p>

                            <h5 class="my-4"> 16. DISCLAIMER </h5>

                            <p>We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information (including sensitive information like credit card information and bank account number)
                            will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will
                            always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct
                            on and off the Site.  </p>
