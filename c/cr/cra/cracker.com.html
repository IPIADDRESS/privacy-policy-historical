<h2>Privacy</h2>

  <strong>Cracker Privacy Policy</strong>

<p><strong>Last Revised: Aug 25, 2015</strong></p>

<p>Cracker.com and its affiliates (collectively, the “Site”) respect your privacy. Here is our Privacy Policy for this Site: </p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Each time you access, use, post, submit a post or reply, or browse the Site, you signify your acceptance of the then-current Privacy Policy.  If you do not accept this Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Site and must discontinue use of the Site immediately. </p>
<p><strong>Liability for content</strong></p>
<p>The content of our sites is delivered with utmost diligence and care possible. However, the Site cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, integrity and actuality of the content. In cases of declaration of violation of rights, the Site will delete the concerned content at the soonest possible time. </p>
<p><strong>Liability for links</strong></p>
<p>Our site contains links to external websites over which we have no control. Thus, the Site cannot be held accountable for the content of those third party websites and the consequences that may arise from the existence of such links on the Site. The operator or provider of the mentioned content is the one responsible for their respective site content. The linked-to websites were reviewed concerning possible violation of rights at the point of publication. However, some illegal content may not be recognizable at the point of publication. A constant and permanent monitoring of the links included on the Site without concrete indication and necessity is deemed unreasonable and infeasible. But in cases of declaration of violation of rights, the Site will delete the concerned link(s) at the soonest possible time. </p>
<p><strong>Collection and processing of personal data</strong></p>
<p>Ads on the Site are obviously made available to the public. Our servers are located in the European Union. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you are consenting to the transfer and storage of that information to and on our servers in the European Union. </p>
<p>We collect and store the following personal information: </p>
• Email address, physical location/contact information and financial information (depending on the service used)<br>
• Computer sign-in data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site as well as ad data (Through cookies which you can disable on your browser. However, this is likely to affect your ability to use the site in terms of functionality).<br>
• Other information including your IP address and standard web log information.<br>
<p>We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication via e-mail) can lead to security issues. A complete protection of data against access of third parties is not possible.
</p><p><strong>Transfer of personal data</strong></p>
<p>Transfer or provision of personal data to a third party occurs only if the Site is lawfully obligated to provide information to authorities in relation to an ad that a user has posted, or if the user has given prior consent to the release of personal data. Otherwise, personal data will not be released, shared or sold to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes without prior permission from the user. </p>
<p><strong>Collection of Non-Personal Information Using Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We automatically receive and record non-personal information on our server logs from your browser as well as through other analysis of the Sites.  Non-personal information includes without limitation your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, cookie information (as described below), the pages you request, type of computer operating system you use (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you use (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer), the domain name of the Internet service provider, your activities while visiting the Site, and the content you accessed.  </p>

<p> “Cookies” are small text files that allow Web sites to store and retrieve information about you from your computer system. The Site does serve cookies to track individual site usage for later aggregation. But we do not use cookies in order to retrieve any information from your computer other than information originally sent in a Site cookie, such as a user code. We have no control over whether and how our advertisers use cookies that originate from their website. </p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information to agents and operators under confidentiality or similar agreements, including shippers, vendors, payment processors, and advertisers, who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information: (i) to provide products or services to you; (ii) to administer our business or the Site, including fulfilling and shipping orders; (iii) to provide customer service; (iv) to update account information; (v) to forward updates, announcements, and newsletters; (vi) to respond to your communications, and communicate with you about the Site and other activities related to the Site; (vii) in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or disposition of all or any portion of the Site’s business or operations (including without limitation in connection with bankruptcy or any similar proceedings); or (viii) as otherwise authorized by you.  </p>

<p><strong>Disclosure in Special Circumstances</strong></p>

<p>We may disclose also your name, email address, or other information about you, including personal information, if (i) required to do so by law, court order or subpoena, or as requested by other government, law enforcement, or investigative authority, (ii) we in good faith believe that such disclosure is necessary or advisable, including without limitation to protect the rights or properties of the Site, (iii) we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, or has breached an agreement, or if anyone else could be harmed by such activities or interference, (iv) if we determine an ad posted violates our Terms of Use or the rights of a third party, or (v) there is an emergency involving personal danger.  We may also provide information about you if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. </p>

<p>Please note that if you post any of your personal information on the Site, such information may be collected and used by others over whom the Site has no control. The Site is not responsible for the use by third parties of information you post or otherwise make public. </p>

<p>From time to time, we may send you information with announcements and updates about the Site and your account. You may elect to opt-out of ongoing e-mail communication from us, such as newsletters, subscriptions, account information, promotional materials, contest results, survey inquiries, etc. by using a simple “opt out” procedure. You need only reply to the communication with the word “unsubscribe” (without the quotation marks) in the body of your e-mail response and your name will be removed from that mailing list. However, if you opt-out of receiving our announcements and updates about your account, you may no longer have access to areas restricted to account members. </p>

<p><strong>Correction/Update of Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>If your personal information changes, you may review/correct/update your personal information previously provided at any time by sending us an email at support@cracker.com.

We store personal information using industry standard, reasonable and technically feasible, physical, technical and administrative safeguards against foreseeable risks, such as unauthorized access.  All commerce transactions that take place on the Site are processed through our secure server in order to make every reasonable effort to insure that your personal information is protected. </p>

<p>Please be aware that the Site and data storage are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond the Site’s control.  We cannot guarantee the security of the information on and sent from the Site.  </p>

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites or the content provided thereon.  We disclaim any responsibility for transactions conducted on those sites and cannot vouch for the security of the information submitted in those transactions. </p>

<p><strong>Policy Changes and Acceptance</strong></p>

<p>The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve.  We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy practices.  Each time you access, use or browse the Site, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.  </p>

<p>Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after Last Revised date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.  </p>
