Clients</h2> <p>Code42 provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business clients ("Clients") that facilitate services including backing up and restoring files and copying backup archives to external hard drives for the purposes of allowing Clients to restore archives for individuals ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, Code42 may obtain access to personal data about such Data Subject in the course of providing the services and solutions (such as when the Client purchases a service in which the backup archive is external hard drives for the purposes of allowing Clients to restore archives for individuals). In other specific instances, Code42 may also obtain access to data about our Clients' end users in the course of providing support services to the Clients ("End Users"). Such data may include email address, CrashPlan and SharePlan system configuration, log files and other information, depending on the particular Client and application at issue.</p> <p>Wherever we obtain access to personal data about Data Subjects or End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them. If you are an End User with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client's website to understand the privacy practices that apply to personal data that we may maintain about you.

In the event of a sale or transfer, Code42 will require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbors, or otherwise take steps to ensure that personal data is appropriately protected. Code42 may also disclose personal data where required or permitted by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or where Code42 believes that such disclosures are appropriate to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or in connection with a law enforcement request.</p> <p>Code42 will not sell, share, rent or trade your personal data with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy statement.</p> <h2>11.

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising; you will continue to receive generic ads that are not based on your specific interests.</p> <h4>Analytics / Log Files </h4> <p>As is true most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/ exit pages, operating system, date/ time stamp, and clickstream data. We may use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p> <h4>Local Storage Objects</h4> <p>We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p> <h2>13. User Forums</h2> <p>If you use a forum on this Web site, you should be aware that any personal data you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal data you choose to submit in these forums. You may remove your post along with your personal data you submit within these forums by contacting us <a href="mailto:privacy@code42.com">privacy@code42.com</a>.</p> <h2>14. Tell a Friend</h2> <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site and download CrashPlan. Code42 stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and inviting this friend to use you as backup destination and / or asking the friend's permission to back up to him or her. Emails sent with our "tell a friend" service will provide the recipient with the opportunity to opt-out of the future promotional messages sent by us.</p> <h2>15. Survey</h2> <p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and company size).</p> <p>We use third-party service providers for marketing purposes and to conduct surveys or contests; these companies are prohibited from using our participants’ personal data for any other purpose. We will not share the personal data you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties without your express permission.</p> <p>Information collected by our voluntary third-party surveys is used to market, validate and promote participant utilization of products and participant opinions of features and benefits of products and to customize the site. In some cases, with the customer’s permission, participant feedback collected in surveys is used as testimonial content on our site.</p> <h2>16. Single Sign-On</h2> <p>You can log in to our <a href="helpdesk.code42.com">http://helpdesk.code42.com/</a> site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p> <h2>17. Support</h2> <p>If you wish to upload a photo of yourself in the support section of the site, please be aware that this will be viewed by other users of the support section. If you wish to remove your photo you may do so at any time by logging into your support account and editing your profile.</p> <h2>18. Notifications via Twitter</h2> <p>If you wish to receive backup notifications via Twitter, you will be asked to sign in using your twitter credentials. When you click on "Authorize", you will be prompted to provide your Twitter PIN to allow CrashPlan to connect to Twitter. By proceeding, you are allowing the Code42 sites to access your information and you are agreeing to the Twitter Terms of Use in your use of Code42 sites. </p> <h2>19. Links to Other Sites</h2> <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Code42 site that you are visiting and be redirected to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal data by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Code42. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party Web site that is linked to a Code42 site, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personal data. </p> <h2>20. Social Media Features</h2> <p>Our Web site includes social media features, such as the "Share This" button that allows you to like us on Facebook or share our content on Twitter. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.</p> <h2>21.
