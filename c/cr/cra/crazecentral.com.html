However, you can open a new, separate account at any time or re-activate your previous account by following instructions we will give you at the time you close your account. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your choices about collection and use of your information</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</li>
	<li>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the Account Settings page associated with your account. You will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>
	<li>In certain places on our site we may ask for your phone number. In those places where we ask for your phone number, we will always tell you how your phone number will be used. Only to provide you a service you requested from us. We will not call you for marketing purposes. If you have provided your phone number but no longer wish to be contacted by phone by us, you can visit the Account Settings page associated with your account to let us know your wishes. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information-handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by e-mail as follows:</p>
