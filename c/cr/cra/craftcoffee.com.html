	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	
	<p>A cookie is a small data file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of the CraftCoffee service. CraftCoffee uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using CraftCoffee's services; display local product offerings; estimate and report CraftCoffee's total audience size and traffic; and conduct research to improve CraftCoffee's content and services. CraftCoffee cookies do not collect personal information, and CraftCoffee does not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or email address is.</p>
	
	<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
	
	<p>CraftCoffee may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the CraftCoffee Terms of Use. CraftCoffee may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with CraftCoffee's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as CraftCoffee in CraftCoffee's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, CraftCoffee may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. CraftCoffee may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.</p>
	
	<p>CraftCoffee is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may operate stores on the CraftCoffee website or sell items to you from the CraftCoffee website. CraftCoffee may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of CraftCoffee's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.</p>
	
	<p>CraftCoffee employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples could include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.</p>
	
	<p>CraftCoffee will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when CraftCoffee has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of CraftCoffee's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, CraftCoffee may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. CraftCoffee will transfer information about you if CraftCoffee is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, CraftCoffee will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the CraftCoffee web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
	
	<p>As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another CraftCoffee user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to CraftCoffee's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should be used for only CraftCoffee-related communications or for CraftCoffee-facilitated transactions. CraftCoffee has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any CraftCoffee user to your email or physical mail list.</p>
	

	

	
	<h2>Third Parties</h2>
	
	<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information CraftCoffee collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on CraftCoffee or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. CraftCoffee does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. CraftCoffee is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the CraftCoffee site. CraftCoffee encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
	
	<h2>Editing and Deleting Account Information</h2>
	
	<p>You can change your CraftCoffee Account Information at any time. CraftCoffee may send you certain communications relating to the CraftCoffee service, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your CraftCoffee account. You can delete your CraftCoffee account by emailing help@craftcoffee.com. Please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in CraftCoffee's records for some period.</p>
	
	<p>CraftCoffee limits access to personal information about you to employees who CraftCoffee believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Your CraftCoffee Account Information is password-protected.</p>
	
	<p>If your personally identifiable information changes you may correct or update it by making the change on your CraftCoffee account page. You may delete or deactivate your account by emailing Customer Support at help@craftcoffee.com. CraftCoffee will respond to your request within 10-20 business days.</p>
	
	<h2>Security</h2>
	
	<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. Your CraftCoffee account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) for registration CraftCoffee encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). CraftCoffee follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once CraftCoffee receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while CraftCoffee strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, CraftCoffee cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on CraftCoffee's Web site, you can email CraftCoffee at help@craftcoffee.com.</p>
	
	<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p>If this privacy policy is changed, CraftCoffee will post changes so that you are aware of those changes. CraftCoffee reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If CraftCoffee makes material changes to this policy you will be notified here, by email, or other places CraftCoffee deems appropriate.</p>
	
	<h2>Questions</h2>
	
	<p>If you have questions or suggestions you can contact CraftCoffee <a href="/contact">via our contact form</a> or by postal mail to Caffeinated Labs, Inc., Attn: Customer Support; 190 Bedford Avenue, Suite 303, Brooklyn, NY 11211. You can also reach us at 877-497-2278.</p>
