        expect to be notified of: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. What personally 
        identifiable information is collected </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. How the information 
        is used </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. With whom the information

        policy </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. This site's policy 
        on correcting and updating personally identifiable information </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. This site's policy 
        on deleting or deactivating your name from our database </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This policy went into effect on March 1, 2000, and was last updated on February 7, 2006.  Should this policy change, a notice will be placed on the home page of Crayola.com and will remain there for 30 days.  Please check back periodically for updates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How We Collect 
        and Use Your Information </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the ways in 
        which you interact with our site allow us to learn more about you. We 
        collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities 
        of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. We use your IP address, which is assigned to your computer by your <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">ISP</a>, 
        to help diagnose problems with our <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">server</a> 
        and to administer our Web site. Your IP address, HTTP protocol elements, and computer information are used to gather broad demographic information.  
        We use <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">cookies</a> to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your 
        Registration ID so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, 
        and for other purposes. We also track the number of people who view each 
        page to learn which features are the most popular. But in these, and almost 
        all other instances, we do not obtain personally identifiable information 
        about you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, it is only to improve your experience on our site. Examples of voluntarily submitting personally identifiable information include our polls, entering sweepstakes or contests, filling out the registration page, submitting a search, sending us feedback or posting in our <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">chat rooms</a> or <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">message boards</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more accurate this information is, the better we are able to customize your experience. Our site's registration form requires users to give us online contact information like your name and E-mail address.  This is for personalization purposes as well as a unique identifier that allows us to contact you if you receive our newsletter or to tell you that you have won one of the sweepstakes offers available to registered users.  Additional demographic and preference information (like birthday, profession, children in household, or reason for using Crayola.com) is to help us customize your experience and develop new features that are most relevant to our users. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners if the customer selects to receive such information. Your contact information is only used with your permission to provide you with information about us  and is never shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors unless specific permission to share information is given</font>. We require that any third parties with whom we share your information maintain this data in a confidential manner. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. </p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may share personal customer information with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers for the purpose of assisting us in delivering our website content, sending email about your Crayola.com registration or other information you have elected to receive, fulfilling customer orders; administering contests or sweepstakes, providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' shopping experiences; and completing credit card transactions. These third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose except providing these services on behalf of Crayola.com. We may also share personal customer information with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities related to the use of our site. We will have no legal liability for such disclosures. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Demographic and profile 
        data may be used for marketing and targeting purposes. Tracking how users 
        interact with our site helps us to develop new features and content. We 
        use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing 
        them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying 
        the content according to their preferences. This information is shared 
        with advertisers only on an aggregate basis, that is, never containing 
        any personally identifiable information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our online surveys 
        and contests ask users for contact information (like their email address). 
        We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about 
        our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The user's 
        contact information is only used to contact the user when necessary. However, 
        on particular pages where we ask for your personally identifiable information, 
        we may explicitly tell you that the data we are collecting on that page 
        will be shared with third parties, in which case those disclosures shall 
        override anything to the contrary in this policy. For example, before 
        you submit answers to questions we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion, 
        we will tell you that your answers will be shared with that advertiser. 
        Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out 
        section below. </font></p>
      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We display advertising on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads may collect anonymous preference and interest visitor information. This information is used to create anonymous interest profiles. This information does not include and is never merged with personally identifiable information (such as name, address or email address) or any information that is considered sensitive or controversial or that would compromise your privacy. These profiles are used to tailor site content, promotions and advertising and to perform market research. 
  </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the event of a 
        complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about 
        you from other users or third parties who may communicate information 
        to us about you in relation to that complaint. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Children's Guidelines 
        </b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Children's privacy 
        is of primary concern to us. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. WE DO NOT collect online contact information without parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to suspend participation in the activity. Without prior parental notification, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. WE DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from children.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. WE DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information from children.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. WE DO NOT give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. WE DO NOT require a child to provide us with more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cookies and Other 
        Tracking Methods </b></font></p>
      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">Cookies</a> 
  are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. 
  We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">ISP</a> 
  addresses for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you to store your password 
  without having to constantly re-enter it. Second, cookies can also help us to 
  tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests. 
  Third, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in 
  turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our 
  users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but 
  some parts of our site may not work properly if you do. Cookies that contain an identifier uniquely linked to you may relate to the information described above.

        to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in 
        these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution 
        when deciding to disclose your personal information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Security </b></font></p>
      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crayola makes every 
  effort to ensure the security of your personal information, and the secure transmission 
  of your information from your PC to our <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">servers</a>. 
  There are security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration 
  of the information under our control. This site uses <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">SSL</a> 
  (secure server software) that <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">encrypts</a> all 
  the personally identifiable information passing back and forth between your 
  PC and our server during registration and online purchase. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We understand that you might 
  be concerned about buying online. That is why your security at our site is as 
  important to us as it is to you, our customer. We use some of the best technology 
  available to ensure that your payment information is processed confidentially 
  and accurately. We use the VeriSign system and technology, which we believe 
  makes shopping at TheCrayolaStore.Com just as safe as your neighborhood store. 
  VeriSign features the industry standard <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">SSL</a> 
  (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, which scrambles your credit card 
  number and your other personal information to prevent the viewing of that data 
  by anyone other than The CrayolaStore.Com. TheCrayolaStore.Com also strives 
  to maintain the security of information stored on our servers to protect against 
  unauthorized access to your personal information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, no 
        data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. We 
        recommend that you never reveal your registration ID to anyone. You will never 
        receive a request from Crayola.com for your registration information in an 
        unsolicited phone call or e-mail. The privacy policy described here applies 
        only to Crayola.com, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web 
        sites to which we <a href="glossary_of_terms.cfm">link</a>, or which link 
        to us. Also, while Crayola hopes to provide a safe and secure online 
        experience, be very careful about sharing your personal information with 
        other people you might meet as a result of your visit to Crayola.com.
