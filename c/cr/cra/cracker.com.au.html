<p>This policy applies to cracker.com.au and explains how Cracker uses personal information collected through the Cracker website.
</p>

Cracker is exempt from complying with the Privacy Act in relation to its journalism activities.  Cracker has publicly committed to complying with the <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://redirect.fairfax.com.au/redir.cgi?from_site=cracker&amp;from_section=help&amp;to=http%3A//www.presscouncil.org.au/')">Australian Press Council Privacy Standards</a> for the use of personal information in the course of journalism.

<h3><a name="personal">What kind of personal information Cracker collects and how it is collected</a></h3><br>
<p>Cracker collects personal information from a variety of sources, including from members of the public, advertisers, prospective employees, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners.
</p>

<p>
In general, the personal information Cracker collects includes (but is not limited to) name, address, contact details, gender, occupation, in some cases membership of professional associations and, where relevant, financial information, including credit card information, banking details and income information.
</p>

<p>
<i>Personal Information you provide</i>:  We store the personal information you enter on the Cracker website or give to Cracker in other ways.  We obtain most personal information through the posting of ads or discussion forums via the Cracker website. You may provide information when you request or acquire a product or service from Cracker or its related companies, provide a product or service to Cracker, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, participate in forums or when you communicate with Cracker by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service or provide feedback).
</p>

<p>

<i>Automatic collection</i>: Cookies: We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'.  Cookies do not contain information by which Cracker can identify you.  They identify your computer to our servers.  You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies.   Cracker may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising which Cracker believes may be of interest, based on that information.  To disable your cookies, please refer to the help menu within your Internet browser.
</p>

<p>
<i>Indirect collection</i>: Cracker endeavours to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual.  In some circumstances Cracker may obtain personal information from a third party.  If you provide personal information about another person to Cracker, Cracker requires that you inform that person you have done so and provide them with a copy of this policy.
