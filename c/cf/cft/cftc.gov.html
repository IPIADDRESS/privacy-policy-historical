    <td><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Privacy Policy for the CFTC Website</font></b><font face="Arial"><p>The purpose of this policy statement is to describe how the CFTC handles
    information which we learn about you when you visit our website. The information we
    receive depends on how you use the website. You are not required to give us personal
    information to visit our website.</p>
    <p>If you visit the CFTC website to read or download information, such as press releases
    or publications, we will collect and store the following information: </p><ul>
      <li>the name of the domain (the machine or website) from which you access the Internet (for
        example, aol.com if you are connecting from an America Online account) and/or the name and
        Internet Protocol (IP) address of the server you are using to access the CFTC website.</li>
      <li>the name and IP address of the CFTC server that received and logged the request.</li>
      <li>the date and time the request was received.</li>
      <li>the information which you are accessing (for example, which page or image you choose to
        read or download).</li>
      <li>the name and version of the web browser used to access the web page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use the information collected to measure the number of visitors to the different
    sections of our website and to help us make the website more useful to visitors.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We do not enable "cookies." A "cookie" is a text file placed on
    your hard drive by a Web site that can be used to monitor your use of the site.</p>
    <p>If you complete a form or send a comment or e-mail, you may be choosing to send us
    information which personally identifies you. This information is used generally to respond
    to your request but may have other uses <i><b>which are identified on each form.</b></i>
    For example, if you send us a comment letter on a proposed regulation, that letter becomes
    part of the comment file and is available to the public. The comments are used to help
    CFTC and other members of the public evaluate proposed Commission actions. Other forms
    which you may choose to submit, such as Freedom of Information Act requests, contain
    information which is used by CFTC employees to track and respond to your request.
    Information provided on the enforcement questionnaire may be shared with other law
    enforcement agencies, if appropriate.</p>
