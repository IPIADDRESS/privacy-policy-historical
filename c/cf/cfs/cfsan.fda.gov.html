<h1>FDA/CFSAN Privacy Policy and Disclaimers</h1>

<p>
</p><blockquote>
Thank you for visiting the FDA/CFSAN web site and for reviewing our
Privacy Policy. Please note that:
<blockquote><b>
We collect no information about you, other than information
automatically collected and stored (see below), when you visit our
web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

<h2>Privacy Policy for The FDA/CFSAN VM Web Site</h2>
<!--
<P>This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit
to the "vm.cfsan.fda.gov" Web Site.</P>
-->
 
 
<dir>
<b>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</b><p>
When you visit the  "vm.cfsan.fda.gov" (aka "www.cfsan.fda.gov")
web site, if you do nothing
during your visit but browse through the web site, read pages, or
download information, we will gather and store certain information
about your visit automatically. This information does not identify
you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following
aggregated general information about your visit:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<li>the pages you visit,
</li><li>the date and time you access our site,
</li><li>
the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example,
aol.com, if you are coming from an America Online account, or purdue.edu
if you are connecting from Purdue University's domain),
</li><li>the Internet address of the website from
which you linked directly to our site, and
</li><li>your operating system and browser.
</li></ul><p>
We use this  information
</p><ul>
<li>to measure the number
of visitors to the different food and nutrition sections of our site,
</li><li>to help us make our site more useful
</li><li>to develop and code content pages so
that most people will be able to view the pages correctly.<p></p>
</li></ul>
<p><b>If You Send Us Personal Information</b>
 
</p><p>If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an
e-mail message or by filling out a form,
 we store the question and e-mail
address information so that we can answer the question that was sent
in, and send the answer back to the e-mail or other
 address or phone provided.  If you send us a comment, we relay the comment to the most appropriate program manager in the agency.
If enough
questions or comments come in that are the same, the question may be added
to our Question and Answer section, or the suggestions may be
used to guide the design of our Web site. Unless otherwise required by statute,
we do not identify publicly who sends questions or comments
into our web site.  </p>
 
<p><b>Children's Privacy</b>
 
</p><p>We collect no information from children under 13. If a child sends
us an e-mail inquiry or comment, we answer, then delete the e-mail from
our files.
 
</p><p><b>CFSAN Listservs</b>
</p><p>
If you subscribe to a CFSAN Listserv, CFSAN considers your e-mail address
confidential and it will not be released under FOI. For your convenience,
you can subscribe to other government and non-government Listservs
from our site. Each Listserv has its own privacy policy which you
should check prior to subscribing.
 
</p><p></p></dir>
 
 
<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<dir>
<p>FDA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal
information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement
or by statute. We will only use personally identifying information to
respond to you or to help us perform our public health duties. In those
cases, various people may see the personal information you provide in
order to look into the matter you inquired about.</p>
<p>We may enter the information you send into an electronic database,
to share with our attorneys and investigators involved in law
enforcement or policy-making. We may also share it with other government
agencies that have public health or consumer protection duties. FDA or
any of those agencies may contact you. In other limited circumstances,
including requests from Congress or private individuals, we may be
required by law to disclose information you submit.</p>
<p>Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If
you are worried because your communication is very sensitive, or
includes personal information such as your social security number,
you can send it by postal mail instead.</p>

<dir>
<b>Links to Other Sites</b>
