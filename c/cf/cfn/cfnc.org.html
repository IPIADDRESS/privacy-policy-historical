	        third parties, except with your express consent and at your direction.

	      <p><font class="bodyTextBold">Why We Collect Your Personal Identifying Information</font><br>
	        Pathways of North Carolina collects personal information from you for 
	        two reasons. The first reason is to enable Pathways of North Carolina 
	        to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection 
	        with the functioning of Pathways of North Carolina. The second reason 
	        is to perform a task, such as filling out a college application, requested 
	        by you. Data is requested and collected by Pathways of North Carolina 
	        only if it is needed either to enable Pathways of North Carolina to contact 
	        you or to perform a function requested by you. When the effective functioning 
	        of a Pathways of North Carolina module does not require personal information, 
	        none is collected, and those modules can be accessed without opening an 
	        account or providing any personal data. </p>
			
	      <p>When you log on to Pathways of North Carolina, your browser will automatically 
	        transmit to Pathways of North Carolina's server the IP address of your 
	        computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits 
	        the IP address of your computer, Pathways of North Carolina does not associate 
	        this IP address with any personally identifiable information regarding 
	        you. Pathways of North Carolina does not collect any personally identifiable 
	        information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.</p>
			
	      <p><font class="bodyTextBold">Minimum Age of 13 to Establish an Account</font><br>
	        Pathways of North Carolina will not collect any information from persons 
	        who are not yet 13 years old. If you are under 13 years of age, you will 
	        not be permitted to create an account on Pathways of North Carolina.</p>
	      <!--<p>This age requirement is in accordance with COPA, the Child Online Protection 
	        Act, which was approved by Congress in October 1998. For more detailed 
	        information on COPA, you may visit www.copacommission.org.</p>-->
	      <p>If you are 13 years of age or older, you are encouraged to create an 
	        account with Pathways of North Carolina and to explore and utilize all

	        during transmission over the Internet. Pathways of North Carolina uses 
	        40-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and

	        You may update, otherwise modify or delete from the data stored on Pathways

	        Carolina using standard word processing techniques. Please recognize that 
	        if you delete information, it will no longer be available on Pathways

	        from Pathways of North Carolina after you made the deletion the deleted 
	        information would no longer be accessible. Similarly, when accessed over

			<h4>Program Policies and Procedures for the Use and Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information</h4>
The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, through the Program Administrator
and other service providers for North Carolina's National College Savings Program, has
certain nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries obtained from
various sources. For example, from a Participant's Enrollment Agreement, the Authority knows the
Participant's name, address and social security number, and the corresponding information for
the Beneficiary of the Account established by the Participant. By the very nature of the Program,
the Authority also knows how each Account is invested, each Account balance, the frequency and
amount of the Contributions of each Account, and the nature of all Account withdrawals. The
nonpublic personal information the Authority has is protected by physical, electronic and
procedural safeguards. The Authority also limits access to all the nonpublic information to
persons who need to know that information to perform their Program services.
<p>The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is used to initiate and maintain
Account investments and otherwise to operate the Program. The Authority may disclose
the information collected, as described above, to a third party in order to market jointly
the programs and services that the Foundation administers on behalf of the Authority.
However, under these circumstances, the Authority will require that the third party,
as a condition of its contract with the Authority or the Program Administrator, maintain
the confidentiality of all nonpublic personal information. The Authority requires all of
these persons to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information about
Participants and Beneficiaries. The Authority may also share
information about Participants and Beneficiaries with the Participant's financial advisor
designated by the Participant on the Enrollment Agreement. The Authority does not otherwise provide nonpublic personal
information about Participants or Beneficiaries to third parties, except to the attorneys,
accountants or auditors who represent the Program or service providers thereto, and as
otherwise permitted or required by law.
