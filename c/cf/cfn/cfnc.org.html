				<p><font class="bodyTextBold">PATHWAYS OF NORTH CAROLINA?S PRIVACY
				POLICY AND ITS EXCEPTIONS </font><br>
				Except as set forth below, personally identifiable data you enter on
				Pathways of North Carolina is not made available or distributed to
				third parties, except with your express consent or at your express
				direction. In particular, Pathways of North Carolina (including the
				University of North Carolina General Administration (UNCGA) which
				administers the Pathways of North Carolina program) and Xap will not
				give, sell or provide access to your personal information to any
				company, individual or organization for its use in marketing or
				commercial solicitation or for any other purpose, except with your
				express consent, at your direction, as is necessary for the
				operation of this site, or pursuant to one of the exceptions listed
				below.</p>

				<p><font class="bodyTextBold">Exceptions to the privacy policy</font><br>
				There are limited exceptions to the Pathways of North Carolina
				privacy policy. When required by law to comply with any valid legal
				process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, regulation or
				court order, Xap or UNCGA will supply such information contained in
				your Pathways of North Carolina account as Xap or UNCGA reasonably
				determines, based on the advice of counsel, it is legally required
				to supply. In addition, Xap or UNCGA may release specific
				information relevant to special cases, such as a physical threat to
				you or others or an attempted breach of security on the Pathways of
				North Carolina site.</p>

				<p><font class="bodyTextBold">THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
				WE COLLECT</font><br>
				Pathways of North Carolina collects personal identifying information
				from you including, but not limited to, your name, date of birth,
				address, e-mail address, telephone number, grade level, parent?s
				e-mail address, such additional information as you choose to include
				in your user profile or are required to provide by the college and
				financial aid applications that you choose to complete, and
				information associated with activities you have undertaken on
				Pathways of North Carolina.</p>

				<p><font class="bodyTextBold">REASONS WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL
				IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</font><br>
				Pathways of North Carolina collects personal information from you
				primarily for three reasons. The first reason is to perform a task
				on Pathways of North Carolina, such as filling out a specific
				college admission application, requested by you. The second reason
				is to enable you to submit in a convenient and efficient manner
				information that is likely to be needed when you complete college
				admission, financial aid and other applications and forms made
				available through Pathways of North Carolina or undertake a
				scholarship search on Pathways of North Carolina, and the third
				reason is to enable Xap to respond to your questions or contact you
				when necessary in connection with the functioning of Pathways of
				North Carolina. When the effective functioning of a Pathways of
				North Carolina module does not require personal information, none is
				collected, and any such module can be accessed without opening an
				account or providing any personal data.</p>

				<p>When you log on to Pathways of North Carolina, your browser will
				automatically transmit to Pathways of North Carolina's server
				the IP address of your computer, type of browser you are using and
				certain other information relating to your computer and its use.
				Although your browser transmits this information, Pathways of North
				Carolina does not associate the IP address of your computer or any
				of this other information transmitted by your browser with any
				personally identifiable information regarding you. Pathways of North
				Carolina does not collect any personally identifiable information
				other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.</p>

				<p><font class="bodyTextBold">MINIMUM AGE OF 13 REQUIRED TO
				ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT </font><br>
				Pathways of North Carolina will not collect any information from
				persons who are not yet 13 years old. If you are under 13 years of
				age, you are not authorized to create an account on Pathways of
				North Carolina, but you can utilize those portions of Pathways of
				North Carolina that do not involve the collection of personal
				information from users.</p>

				<p>If you are 13 years of age or older, you are encouraged to create
				an account on Pathways of North Carolina and to utilize all of
				Pathways of North Carolina, which will help you plan, prepare and
				pay for your future education.</p>

				<p><font class="bodyTextBold">WAYS IN WHICH PERSONAL IDENTIFYING
				INFORMATION MAY BE USED </font><br>
				Pathways of North Carolina will use your personal identifying
				information to complete the following forms and surveys, to obtain
				information for you and to effect transactions on your behalf, in
				each case only upon your instructions to do so:</p>
				<p>
				</p><ul>
					<li>Complete applications for admission <br>

				address and any information that you submit on an application for a
				scholarship, grant or loan. We do not disclose any nonpublic

				or permitted by applicable federal or State law. Since the Authority

				<h4>Program Policies and Procedures for the Use and Disclosure of
				Nonpublic Personal Information</h4>
				<p>The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, through
				the Program Administrator and other service providers for the
				Program, has certain nonpublic personal information about
				Participants and Beneficiaries obtained from various sources. For
				example, from a Participant's Enrollment Agreement, the
				Authority knows the Participant's name, address and social
				security number, and the corresponding information for the
				Beneficiary of the Account established by the Participant. By the
				very nature of the Program, the Authority also knows how each
				Account is invested or allocated, each Account balance, the
				frequency and amount of the Contributions of each Account, and the
				nature of all Withdrawals. The nonpublic personal information the
				Authority has is protected by physical, electronic and procedural
				safeguards. The Authority also limits access to all this nonpublic
				information to persons who need to know that information to perform
				their Program services.</p>

				<p>The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is used to
				initiate and maintain Accounts and otherwise to operate the Program.
				The Authority may disclose the information collected, as described
				above, to third parties in order to market jointly and to administer
				the programs and services that the Program Administrator administers
				on behalf of the Authority. However, under these circumstances, the
				Authority will require that the third party, as a condition of its
				contract with the Authority or the Program Administrator, protect
				the confidentiality of all nonpublic personal information to the
				extent required by law and limit its usage to the extent necessary
				to perform services in connection with the Program. The Authority
				requires all of these persons to protect the confidentiality of
				nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries.
				The Authority may also share information about Participants and
				Beneficiaries with the Participant's consent. The Authority
				does not otherwise provide nonpublic personal information about
				Participants or Beneficiaries to third parties, except to the
				attorneys, accountants or auditors who represent the Authority or
				service providers thereto, and as otherwise permitted or required by
				law.</p>
