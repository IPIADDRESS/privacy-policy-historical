                    <li><strong>Saliva sample and bio-banking.</strong> To use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genome Service® testing kit, register an online account, and ship your saliva sample to our third-party laboratory.  Once received, your saliva sample will be identified by its unique barcode, along with your gender and your date of birth.  The barcode label identifies you to us but not to our third-party laboratory.  Unless you choose to store your sample with 23andMe (called “bio-banking”), your saliva samples and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, unless the laboratory’s legal and regulatory requirements require it to maintain physical samples.

                    <li><span id="jump-link-def-genetic-information"><strong>Genetic Information.</strong></span> Genetic Information refers to features of your DNA that distinguish you from other people (e.g. the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs at particular locations in your genome) and is generated when we analyze and process your saliva sample, or when you otherwise contribute or access your Genetic Information through our Services.  Genetic Information includes the 23andMe Results information reported to you as part of our Services, and may be used for other purposes, as outlined in Section 2 below.

                <li><strong>Information you choose to share with others</strong><br><br>
                <p>23andMe gives you the ability to share information with other individuals who have 23andMe accounts through (i) our community forums, (ii) relative finding features (e.g., “DNA Relatives”), and (iii) other sharing features (such information is “User Content”).  Please refer to your settings.  You may be required to opt-in to some of this sharing, but some features require an opt-out.  For example, we provide the ability to opt-in to our ancestry DNA Relatives Database where your information will be shared with potential relative matches.  Alternatively, if you were participating in the DNA Relatives Database you may opt-out or change the visibility of your profile data by visiting your Settings. Also, please note that certain types of your User Content may be viewable by other 23andMe users and once posted, you may not be able to delete or modify such content.
                </p>
                <p>You may decide to disclose your personal information to friends and/or family members, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals outside of our Services, including through third-party services such as social networks and third-party apps that connect to our website and mobile apps through our application programming interface (“API”). These third parties may use your personal information differently than we do under this Privacy Statement. Please make such choices carefully and review the privacy policies of all other third parties involved in the transaction.  For example, if you have enabled a 23andMe sharing feature with another person who downloads a third-party app that uses our API, your information may also be obtained by that third-party app developer and, potentially, by other users of that third-party app.
                </p>
                <p>In general, personal information, once shared or disclosed, can be difficult to contain or retrieve.  23andMe will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared personal information with others. Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the personal information of a 23andMe customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of each person within that account. It is incumbent upon all users to share personal information and account access only with people they know and trust. Users with multi-profile accounts (e.g., where family member accounts are linked) should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.

                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>General service providers.</strong> We share the information described above in Section 1 with our service providers, as necessary to provide their services to us.  Service providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services.  For example, we work with third-party laboratories and contractors to process and analyze your saliva sample for purposes of generating your <a href="#jump-link-def-genetic-information">Genetic Information</a>.<br><br>

                    <p>NOTE:  Our service providers act on 23andMe’s behalf. While we implement procedures and contractual terms to protect the confidentiality and security of your information, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and security of your information due to the inherent risks associated with storing and transmitting data electronically.<br>For example, to learn more about our third-party laboratories, <a class="toggle-collapsible-text" href="#">click here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="collapsible-text">When you purchase a testing kit from 23andMe, you are instructed to send a saliva sample to our third-party laboratory with a unique barcode label. The unique barcode identifies you to us but not to the laboratory.  We are also required to provide to the laboratory, your sex/gender and date of birth or age pursuant to clinical laboratory requirements such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).  No other <a href="#jump-link-def-registration-information">Registration Information</a> (such as your name, address, email, phone number or other contact information) is required or provided to the laboratory.  The receiving personnel at the laboratory will remove and discard your “sender information” from the packaging (e.g., name, address) before testing personnel receive the samples for processing.  Receiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are labeled only with the unique barcode.  Unless you choose to store your sample, DNA and saliva samples are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, provided that laboratory legal and regulatory requirements no longer require the actual samples to be maintained.  The laboratory securely sends the resulting <a href="#jump-link-def-genetic-information">Genetic Information</a> to us along with your unique barcode. <a href="#jump-link-def-genetic-information">Genetic Information</a> is stored securely on our servers; the laboratory also stores your <a href="#jump-link-def-genetic-information">Genetic Information</a>, but again, labeled only with the barcode.<br><br>

                    <li><span id="jump-link-def-targeted-advertising-service-providers"><strong>“Targeted advertising” service providers.</strong></span> We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web Behavior Information on our Service to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements (“ads”) to you. They use cookies and similar technologies (such as JavaScript, beacons, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Note that we do not share <a href="#jump-link-def-registration-information">Registration Information</a>, <a href="#jump-link-def-genetic-information">Genetic Information</a> or <a href="#jump-link-def-self-reported-information">Self-Reported Information</a> with these advertising partners.
                    <p>If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may be able to opt-out of many advertising networks by visiting <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed" target="_blank">here</a> (if you are located in Canada, click <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>; or if you are located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>).

                    <li><strong>Aggregate information.</strong> We may share aggregate information with third parties, which is any information that has been stripped of your <a href="#jump-link-def-registration-information">Registration Information</a> (e.g., your name and contact information) and aggregated with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual (“Aggregate Information”).  This Aggregate Information is different from “individual-level” information.  Individual-level <a href="#jump-link-def-genetic-information">Genetic Information</a> or <a href="#jump-link-def-self-reported-information">Self-Reported Information</a> consists of data about a single individual’s genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information.  For example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that “30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,” without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user.  We may provide such Aggregate Information in commercial arrangements with our business partners.  In contrast, individual-level Genetic Information could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or all of the Genetic Information about that user.  23andMe will ask for your consent to share individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you.
                    </li>
