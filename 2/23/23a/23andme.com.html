                <li><strong>"Self-Reported Information"</strong> is all information about yourself, including your disease conditions, other health-related information, personal traits, ethnicity, family history, and other information that you enter into surveys, forms, or features while signed in to your 23andMe account.  Self-Reported Information is included in 23andWe Research only if you have given consent as described in the applicable Consent Document.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"User Content"</strong> is all information, data, text, software, music, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other materials - <em>other than</em> Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information - generated by users of 23andMe Services and transmitted, whether publicly or privately, to or through 23andMe.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"Web Behavior Information"</strong> is information on how you use the 23andMe website (e.g. browser type, domains, page views) collected through log files, cookies, and web beacon technology.

    <strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
    <ul>
                <li>23andMe collects Personal Information from you for all purposes necessary to ensure the regular operation of your account and/or availability of our Services. These include, among other things, providing you with our Services; improving our Services and/or offering new products or services to you; informing you about events; inviting you to participate in specific research projects, contacting you to obtain testimonials or for other promotional purposes; performing quality control activities; conducting other R&amp;D; and, upon your consent, conducting 23andWe Research.
                </li>
                <li>We use Registration Information to enable your purchase, inform you when your Genetic Information is available to you, provide you with customer service, manage our Services, and authenticate your website visits and usage.
                </li>
                <li>We may disclose to third parties, and/or use in our Services, <strong>"Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information"</strong>, which is Genetic and Self-Reported Information that has been stripped of Registration Information and combined with data from a number of other users sufficient to minimize the possibility of exposing individual-level information while still providing scientific evidence.  If you have given consent for your Genetic and Self-Reported Information to be used in 23andWe Research as described in the applicable Consent Document, we may include such information in Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information intended to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  If you have given consent to participate in 23andWe Research, we may also allow research contractors to access your individual-level Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information onsite at 23andMe’s offices for the purpose of conducting scientific research, provided that all such research contractors will be supervised by 23andMe and subject to 23andMe’s access rules and guidelines.  Similarly, if you have consented to use of your individual-level data in the Research Portal feature, qualified researchers (who must comply with certain requirements) may access your individual-level Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information for the purpose of scientific research, which could lead to commercial use.  If you do not give consent for your Genetic and Self-Reported Information to be used in 23andWe Research or your individual-level Genetic and Self-Reported Information to be used in the Research Portal, we may still use your Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information for R&amp;D purposes as described above, which may include disclosure of Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
                </li>
                <li>Except as otherwise set forth herein, we will never release your individual-level Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information to a third party without asking for and receiving your explicit consent to do so, unless required by law.
                </li>
                <li>We use Web Behavior Information to track and monitor aggregate usage of our website, for R&amp;D, for quality control, to improve our Services, and/or to target advertising for our products and services, and if you have given consent to participate in 23andWe Research as described in the applicable Consent Document, your Web Behavior Information may be used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form for 23andWe Research intended to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. If you do not give consent to participate in 23andWe Research, we may still use your Web Behavior Information for R&amp;D purposes as described above, which may include disclosure of aggregated Web Behavior Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
                </li>
                <li>We give you the ability to share your Genetic Information with other 23andMe customers through sharing features.
                </li>
	</ul>

    <strong>Information Disclosure</strong><br>
    <ul>
                <li>We will not disclose your individual-level Personal Information to any third party, except under the following circumstances:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Partners or service providers (e.g. our contracted genotyping laboratory or credit card processors) use and/or store the information in order to provide you with 23andMe's Services.
                        </li>
            			<li>If you have consented for research, research contractors may access your individual-level Genetic and Self-Reported Information onsite at 23andMe's offices for the purpose of scientific research, provided that all such research contractors will be supervised by 23andMe and subject to 23andMe's access rules and guidelines.</li>
                        <li>If you have consented to use of your individual-level data in the Research Portal feature, qualified researchers (who must comply with certain requirements) may access your individual-level Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information for the purpose of scientific research, which could lead to commercial use.</li>
                        <li>We are required to do so by law or we do so in coordination with regulatory authorities (see the section below titled "Information Disclosure Required By Law").
                        </li>
                        <li>You have provided explicit consent for us to do so.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li> 
                </ul>

    <strong>Your Choices</strong><br>
    <ul>
                <li>Contribution of Personal Information other than Registration Information is voluntary and permission-based.
                </li>
                <li>Whether to give consent for 23andMe to use your Genetic and Self-Reported Information for 23andWe Research or the Research Portal is voluntary.
                </li>
                <li>Providing Self-Reported Information through surveys, forms, or features is voluntary.
                </li>
                <li>At your written request we will close your account. As a result, all Genetic Information will be removed from the account and will no longer be accessible.  23andMe will not use your Genetic Information in new research that starts thirty (30) days or more after account closure.  We cannot remove Genetic Information that has previously been used for published research or shared with external collaborators before account closure.  (See the section below titled "Account Closure and Correction of Personal Information".)
                </li>
                </ul>

    <strong>Additional Information</strong><br>

    <p><strong>Your Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>In the course of your relationship with 23andMe, we collect several types of Personal Information.  <strong>"Personal Information"</strong> is information that could be used to identify you, either alone or in combination with other information. We collect such information from you when you purchase our Services, create a personal account, complete surveys and forms, and/or when you communicate with us or request information from us.  Personal Information collected online or through our mobile application can be combined with Personal Information collected offline. We collect five primary types of Personal Information through our Service and website.
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>"Registration Information"</strong> is information that we collect from you when you purchase or sign up for our Services. Examples of such information include your name, credit card information, billing and shipping addresses, and contact information, such as email address and telephone number.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"Genetic Information"</strong> consists of your genotype, e.g. the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs at particular locations in your genome.  Genetic Information is generated when you purchase 23andMe's Service and your saliva sample is analyzed and processed or you otherwise contribute or access your Genetic Information through our Services.   Our instructions for sample collection and shipment clearly require you to send only your saliva sample to our third-party laboratory labeled with the unique barcode and no other identifier.  The unique barcode identifies you to us but not to the laboratory. We are also required to provide sex and date of birth or age to the laboratory pursuant to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) requirements.  No other Personal Information is required for the analysis.  To protect your privacy, receiving personnel at the laboratory will remove and discard any identifying information (e.g. name, address) included with saliva samples before testing personnel receive the samples for genotyping.  Receiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel only handle samples labeled with the unique barcode.  Unless you choose to store your sample, DNA and saliva samples are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, provided that laboratory legal and regulatory requirements no longer require the actual samples to be maintained.  The laboratory securely sends the resulting Genetic Information to us along with your unique barcode.  Genetic Information is stored securely on our servers; the laboratory also stores your Genetic Information, but labeled only with a sample barcode.  The laboratory conducting DNA extraction and analysis does not have access to your name, other Registration Information, or any other Personal Information except your sex and date of birth or age, as required by CLIA.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"Self-Reported Information"</strong> includes information you provide to us, including but not limited to information about your disease conditions (e.g. Type 2 Diabetes), other health-related information (e.g. pulse rate, cholesterol levels, visual acuity), personal traits (e.g., eye color, height), ethnicity, and/or family history (e.g. similar information about family members).  We collect this information from you if and when you enter the information into surveys, forms, or features while signed in to your account.  Self-Reported Information is included in 23andWe Research only you have given consent as described in the applicable Consent Document.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"User Content"</strong> is all information <em>other than</em> Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information generated by users of 23andMe Services and transmitted, whether publicly or privately, to 23andMe.  User Content may include data, text, software, music, audio, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or other materials.  For example, User Content includes posts made to the 23andMe community forums or emails to Customer Support.  User Content <em>does not</em> include Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information.
                </li>
                <li><strong>"Web Behavior Information"</strong> is information on how you use the 23andMe website (e.g. browser type, domains, page views) collected through log files, cookies, and web beacon technology. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>"Referral Information"</strong> is information that you provide when referring 23andMe Services to your friends and contacts as part of a 23andMe referral program.  This information can include your name, your email address, and the name and email address of the person you are referring our Services to.  If you chose to allow 23andMe to access your address book on your computer or mobile device, we will collect the contact information of the friends you select to enter the referral program.  When you make referrals using a social network such as Facebook or Twitter it may also include information from your profile that is made available to 23andMe when we connect to your social network to post the referral on your behalf. The information that 23andMe is provided during this process varies depending on the social network and your privacy settings, but can include information such as your name, profile picture, network, gender, username, user ID, age range, language, country, friends lists or followers and any other information you have permitted the social network to share with third parties. Additionally, we and our third party partner who administers our referral program may use cookies to identify you and your referred friends and to monitor the success of our referral program.
                </li>
                </ol>

    <p><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>23andMe collects Personal Information from you for all purposes necessary to ensure the regular operation of your account and/or availability of our Services. These include, among other things, providing you with our Services; improving our Services and/or offering new products or services to you; informing you about events; inviting you to participate in specific research projects, contacting you to obtain testimonials or for other promotional purposes; performing quality control activities; conducting other R&amp;D; and, upon your authorization, conducting 23andWe Research.</p>
          <p>23andMe may provide your Personal Information to our third-party service providers, which are companies and people that help us provide, understand and improve our Services.  For example, we may use service providers to help host our website, run our mobile application, send emails, implement our marketing campaigns, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, conduct surveys or polls, obtain testimonials, or otherwise help us run or improve our business.  In all instances, our service providers act on 23andMe’s behalf and we require by contract that they protect the confidentiality of any information they receive from us.</p>
          <p>We do not ask you for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or Services.  Below we will describe the additional ways in which we use subsets of Personal Information.</p>

    <p><strong>How We Use Registration Information</strong></p>
    <p>We use your Registration Information to authenticate your website and mobile application visits and usage; to enable your purchase; to communicate with you about information, services, and products that you have requested; and to manage and improve our website, mobile application, software, and Services.  We give you the opportunity to opt out of optional communications, either through our Service or by contacting our Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:hpa@23andme.com">privacy@23andme.com.</a></p>

    <p><strong>How We Use Genetic and Self-Reported Information</strong></p>
    <p>We use your Genetic and Self-Reported Information to provide you with 23andMe Services, customize the user experience, and enhance our features. <strong>IF</strong> you allow sharing, Genetic and Self-Reported Information may be displayed in other users' accounts.  Self-Reported Information is used to customize your user experience - for example, by adjusting reports of genetic risk to account for your reported behaviors or environmental exposures.
            </p>
            <p>If, and only if, you have given consent to participate in 23andWe Research as described in the applicable Consent Document, we may include your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information in Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information disclosed to third parties for the purpose of publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  23andWe Research is intended to advance genetic knowledge and to create, commercialize, or undertake activities toward the practical applications of this learning to the improvement of health care.  Towards the same goals, if you have given consent to participate in 23andWe Research, we may allow research contractors to access your individual-level Genetic and/or Self-Reported Information onsite at 23andMe’s offices for the purpose of conducting scientific research, provided that all such research contractors will be supervised by 23andMe and subject to 23andMe’s access rules and guidelines.  If, and only if, you have given consent to use of your individual-level data in the Research Portal, we may provide your individual-level Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information to qualified researchers for the purpose of scientific research and publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, which could also lead to commercial uses of such information.  When your Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information is being used for research purposes, pursuant to 23andWe Research, research onsite at 23andMe or via the Research Portal, it will never be combined with your Registration Information.
            </p>
            <p>If you do not give your consent to participate in 23andWe Research, 23andMe may still use your Genetic and Self-Reported Information for purposes such as quality control or other R&amp;D activities.  Genetic and Self-Reported Information used for such purposes may be included in Aggregated Genetic and Self-Reported Information disclosed to third-party research partners who will not publish the information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific/medical research or conduct or support the development of drugs or devices to diagnose, predict, or treat health conditions.
            </p>

    <p><strong>How We Use User Content and Web Behavior Information</strong></p>
    <p>23andMe uses User Content to provide our Services and improve the overall user experience.  For example, posts made to the 23andMe community forums are publicly displayed to other users.

                </p>
                <p>Web Behavior Information is collected through log files, cookies, and web beacon technology during a visit to the 23andMe website.  Web Behavior Information is used to improve our Services and the overall user experience, and if you have given consent to participate in 23andWe Research as described in the applicable Consent Document, your Web Behavior Information may be used and disclosed to third parties in aggregate form for 23andWe Research intended to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. If you do not give consent to participate in 23andWe Research, we may still use your Web Behavior Information for R&amp;D purposes as described above, which may include disclosure of aggregated Web Behavior Information to third-party non-profit and/or commercial research partners who will not publish that information in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.</p>
                <p><strong>Log Files.</strong>  When users visit our website or use our mobile application, 23andMe gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data (i.e. a list of pages or URLs visited). This information may be linked to a particular user’s profile ID or order number.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, identify and resolve issues, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  The 23andMe website also uses cookies. For information about cookies and how they are used on 23andMe’s website, please read our <a href="/about/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong>  A web beacon is a clear graphic image that is loaded by your web browser when it accesses a website and that records a user's visit to a particular web page.  We, or third parties that work for us, may place cookies and web beacons on our website, in our emails, and in our advertisements that appear on other websites or in emails sent by others that mention our products and services with our permission.   The purpose of our web beacons is to support operation of our website and to offer additional products and services through targeted advertisements.  For example, we may use beacons to determine when someone views a web page, count how many individuals visit our website after clicking advertisements placed on other websites, or count how many people have purchased products from our website after viewing an advertisement we placed.  Web beacons may also help us determine the effectiveness of an email campaign because the beacons can count the number of individuals who open an email or forward it to others.  We use this Web Behavior Information to better tailor our marketing to you and may also use this information to customize content on our website, enable a shopping cart, or conduct research.   Third parties only collect anonymous Web Behavior Information through the use of web beacons, allowing statistical analysis relating to the performance of our advertising.
                </p>
                <p>If you wish to disable web beacons, it is possible to prevent your browser from loading them, although there is not currently a standard method for doing so.
                </p>

    <p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
    <p>23andMe gives you the ability to connect with other individuals who have 23andMe accounts through our community forums, relative finding features, and other sharing features.

We recommend that you make such choices carefully.
                </p>
                <p>Personal Information, once released or shared, can be difficult to contain.  23andMe will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with a third party.  Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the Personal Information of a 23andMe customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of that person.  It is incumbent upon customers to share Personal Information only with people they know and trust.  Users with multi-profile accounts should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.
