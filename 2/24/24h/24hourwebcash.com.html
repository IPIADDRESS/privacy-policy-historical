This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and

provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.<br><br>
<b>ONLINE ORDERING</b><br><br>

merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but 
does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the customer 
provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVS (back of card) number, 
and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp;  You should consider all this information available 
to the website.&nbsp;  This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase 
Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.<br><br>
<b>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</b><br><br>
Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:  one, 
they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to the general
