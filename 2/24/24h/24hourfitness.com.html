            Welcome to 24HourFitness.com!  We want 24HourFitness.com to be your source for health and fitness information, products, services and tools.  We know that your privacy is important to you, so your privacy as you use our site is very important to us.  This privacy policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and what we do to protect it.  We hope that this privacy policy is straightforward and clear, but if you have any questions about it, please e-mail <a href="mailto:cpo@24hourfit.com">Chief Privacy Officer</a>. <p>
<b>Information We Gather</b></p><p>
<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i><br>
In order to become a member of 24HourFitness.com and have access to our members'
only areas, we ask you to register with our site and provide your e-mail address
and name. We also ask for your 24 Hour Fitness Club membership number (if you
are a member) in order to help us enhance your use of our site and clubs. This
Registration Information is personally identifiable information because it allows
us to contact you and distinguish you from other users.
</p><p>
You may also buy health products and club memberships on our site.  If you make purchases through 24HourFitness.com, we need to gather information relating to the sale, including what you are buying, how you are paying and where you would like the products shipped.  However, we will use that Transactional Information only to complete the transaction, to provide you with an order history and to facilitate future orders.  We may also use information about the transaction for aggregate reporting (where we summarize the data in a report that does not contain your personally identifiable information).</p><p>

If you are a member of 24HourFitness.com, you may enter contests.  If you enter a 24HourFitness.com contest, we record your entry and link it to your 24HourFitness.com Registration Information.</p><p>
We may receive additional personally identifiable information from you through communications with 24HourFitness.com.  If so, we will use that information to fulfill your request and for aggregate reporting before deleting it from our active system.  For example, if you e-mail 24HourFitness.com to ask about an article or tool, we will use that information to give you an answer, to make sure that you are satisfied with our answer, to have a history of our service to you and to make our service better by reporting your request, without any personally identifying information, in our customer service totals.</p><p>
<i>Other Information</i><br>
In order to maintain and improve 24HourFitness.com, we also gather some statistical data when you visit the site.  The exact information we collect may vary, but can include the date and time of an access to our site, the Internet Protocol address of a computer requesting a page, the pages requested, and computer and connection information such as browser type and operating system.  We do not associate this statistical information with your personally identifiable information.</p><p>
Also, if you respond to a poll, we will aggregate your responses with those of other 24HourFitness.com members but we do not associate your response with any personally identifiable information.</p><p>
<i>Public Information</i><br>
24HourFitness.com provides you with many ways to submit information to be posted on our site including participating in our forums and asking our experts a question.  In each of these circumstances, 24HourFitness.com gathers information from you.  Be aware that anything you submit to 24HourFitness.com through these services may be made public, so please remember not to include any information you want kept private.  Information submitted to forums or experts can be read, recorded and used by any third party or by 24HourFitness.com.
</p><p> <i>Cookies</i><br>
  Like many web sites, we use "cookies," which are stored on your computer and 
  contain small amounts of information sent by 24HourFitness.com to your computer 
  and read by 24HourFitness.com when you visit the different pages of our website. 
  For example, cookies allow us to remember your username and password as you 
  navigate around our site. Cookies also allow us to ensure that you may only 
  respond once per day to polls or contests. For more information about cookies, 
  please visit <a href="http://www.privacyfoundation.org/" target="blank">The 
  Privacy Foundation</a>.
</p><p><i>Activity Tags</i><br>
  Like many web sites, we use "activity tags" (also called "Spotlight 
  tags"). These invisible tags provide information to third parties about 
  the flow of users on our site and other web sites. 24HourFitness.com also receives 
  reports generated from that information. Information collected through the use of 
  activity tags on our site is never linked to any personally identifiable information 
  you provided to 24HourFitness.com. For more information about Activity Tags, 
  please visit <a href="http://www.privacyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The 
  Privacy Foundation</a>.
</p><p>
<i>Children</i><br>
24HourFitness.com is not designed for children.  We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.</p><p>
<b>How We Use That Information</b></p><p>
We do not rent, sell, transfer or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party, except as expressly stated below.</p><p>
As noted, we gather the information discussed above for purposes of providing and improving 24HourFitness.com for you. For example, we use the information to allocate system resources and communicate with you about updates and new features, among other things. </p><p>
As described above, we also aggregate information supplied by users during registration and information about their use of 24HourFitness.com to maintain our services and describe our user base to potential partners, investors and advertisers.  In providing this information, however, we do not reveal any personally identifiable information, only supply summary data about our community of users. </p><p>
There are some limited circumstances in which we may  need to disclose personally identifiable information about you, and we want you to know about them. </p><p>
We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit card payments, holding live chats, hosting message boards or other functions necessary for us to provide services to you.  We may need to share your personally identifiable information with these companies.  However, we will provide them with only the information necessary to perform their functions, and will not allow them to use that information for any other purposes. 
</p><p>
In the interest of enhancing our service, we form partnerships with other web-based
  services. Some of these partnerships include the sharing of some of your personal
  information with our partners in order to extend these services to you. We
  require that our partners respect your privacy and not disclose your information
  to other organizations without your consent, but beyond that, our partners'
  use of your information is governed by their privacy policies. You will be
  given the opportunity to opt out of joining any of our partner services at
  the time of registration. 
</p><p>
We may reveal user information if we believe that user is harming or interfering
  with other 24HourFitness.com users, anyone else, or violating (either intentionally
  or unintentionally) our User Agreement, or infringing any of 24HourFitness.com's
  rights, or trespassing on, damaging, or abusing any of 24HourFitness.com's
  property.
</p><p>
24HourFitness.com will reveal information, including personally identifiable information, to the extent it believes it is required to do so by law.  If we are asked by subpoena or other legal means to disclose any of your personally identifiable information we will, if permitted by law, attempt to notify you via the e-mail address you supplied during registration at least ten days before we respond to the request.</p><p>
24HourFitness.com may transfer any information, including any personally identifiable information, in connection with a sale of all or most of the assets of the company.  </p><p>
<b>Accessing and Changing Your Information</b></p><p>
24HourFitness.com is committed to ensuring that you have control over your Registration Information. You can change your password and other Registration Information using the <a href="/db/content.registered_home">eClub Member Home</a> page.</p><p>
<b>Data Security</b></p><p>
Your 24HourFitness.com account is password protected so that only you may use it.
