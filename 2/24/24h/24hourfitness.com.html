<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>1.1 <b>Questions. &nbsp;If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:cpm@24hourfit.com">cpm@24hourfit.com</a>, &nbsp;or contact us by mail at the following address:</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 Hour Fitness<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.O. Box 2689<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlsbad, CA 92018</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <b>Scope.</b> &nbsp;This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect from you offline (e.g., when you sign up at one of our facilities or clubs) and does not apply to information we collect at or through our Internet website. View our <a href="http://www.24hourfitness.com/company/policies/privacy/privacy_policy.html">Website Privacy Policy</a> for our information collection and privacy practices for information collected through our website, mobile website, mobile applications, and other electronic and digital means of communication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>2.1 <b>Information You Provide Us.</b> We collect information from you when you purchase a membership and other services from us. The information we collect includes personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, telephone number and email address. You may also provide non-personally identifiable information, for example, demographic information such as gender and date of birth, or the name of your employer or school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information we collect may include the following:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Name<br style="margin-left: 20.0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Home address<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Home / mobile telephone number<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Email address<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Gender<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Credit, debit or other payment account number and related information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Health-related information (as explained below)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Date of birth<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• For corporate sponsored program participants only: Name of Employer and employment verification<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• For health insurance related program participants only: Insurance Information<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• For school-related programs: name of School or Group &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• For children enrolled in Kid’s Club: we collect from the parent/legal guardian, the name, date of birth, parent/legal guardian contact information, list of known allergies, and physical description (hair and eye color)</p>
<p>Guests are asked to provide certain contact and demographic information.</p>
<p>We also collect a limited amount of fitness, physical activity and health related information from you if you sign-up for personal training services or our Fitness Consultation service. This information (such as whether you suffer from a heart condition, dizziness, high blood pressure, and knee or back problems) helps you determine your eligibility to participate in our personal training and Fitness Consultation programs. If you participate in our training or consultation/orientation programs, we may also obtain certain measurements, height, weight and age from you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 <b>Cardless Check-in System.</b> &nbsp;24 Hour Fitness has implemented a Cardless Check-In system in its locations. This allows members to check-in without their membership card, and by using a fingerprint scanner. By scanning your finger, we chart the distance between a few distinct points that are unique to you and come up with an identifying number based on those distances. <b>We do not store your fingerprints, nor can the data we store be re-created into a fingerprint image. Additionally, we do not sell, lease, rent, trade or otherwise transfer the data collected by the Cardless Check-In system to any third parties.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 <b>Other Sources.</b> We may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, commercially available sources, social networks, and other third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4 <b>Aggregated Information</b>. We may aggregate personally identifiable information. &nbsp;Aggregated information is not personally identifiable information because it does not identify and is not associated with you or any other user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 I<b>n-Club Wireless Access.</b> As a convenience to our members, internet access may be available in our facilities via wireless hotspots. &nbsp;Any such in-club wireless access is provided by 3rd parties and not by 24 Hour Fitness, and we do not collect any information in relation to your use of the in-club wireless access. &nbsp;We are not responsible for the 3rd party privacy, information or other practices.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3 <b>Other Purposes.</b> We may use non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. &nbsp;In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (such as associating your name with your employer if you are a participant in a corporate sponsored program), in which case we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information as long as it is combined. &nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3>4. How We Share Your Information</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1 <b>Our Third Party Service Providers.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;We may share your information with our third party service providers and agents who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, text messaging, credit card or other payment account processing, auditing and similar services. &nbsp;Contracts with our service providers require them to keep information confidential.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>4.2 <b>Advertising and Third Party Advertisers.</b> &nbsp;We may provide your personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, and a record of any transactions you conduct with us, to third-party advertising companies and their service providers to display online advertising that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;You can learn about these advertising practices and your choices in connection with them by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) consumer information page at www.aboutads.info and the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out page at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.</a> &nbsp;The DAA and NAI are self-regulatory organizations that provide educational content and opt-out tools to help Internet users learn about and exercise choice with respect to online interest-based advertising practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3 <b>Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm.</b> &nbsp;We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on 24 Hour Fitness. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to 24 Hour Fitness, our members or other individuals. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4 <b>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.</b> &nbsp;If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business to a third party, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to the new owner to be used consistent with this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.5 <b>Corporate and Insurance Programs.</b> &nbsp;If you have a corporate employer sponsored or health insurance sponsored membership, upon the request of your employer or insurance provider, as applicable, we may share usage statistics and information, including your name, date of birth, insurance identification number and how often you use one of our facilities.</p>
