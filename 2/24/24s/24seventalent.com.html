Policy”) for the sites operated by 24 Seven LLC and its affiliated entities (“24
Seven,” “we,” “us,” “our”) in the United States (the “US Sites”) and the United
Kingdom (the “UK Site” and together with the US Sites and various related
services collectively referred to herein as the “Sites”).&nbsp; The Sites include those located at <a href="http://www.24seveninc.com/" target="_blank">www.24seveninc.com</a><span class="MsoHyperlink">,</span>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.24seventalent.com/" target="_blank">www.24seventalent.com</a> and <a href="http://www.24seveninc.co.uk/">www.24seveninc.co.uk</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The US Sites are owned and
operated by 24 Seven LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with offices located
at 120 Wooster Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10012. &nbsp;The UK Site is operated by 24 Seven LLC and

registered office is at 5 New Street Square, London EC4A 3TW.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This Privacy Policy sets forth
our policies regarding the collection, use, disclosure, sharing, transfer,
and/or deletion of certain information relating to you and your use of the
Sites. Your use of the Sites signifies your understanding and acceptance of the
terms of this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;This
Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into, and made a part of, the applicable terms
and conditions of use of the Sites (the “Terms of Use”), which govern your use
of the Sites, in general.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">WE UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION IS TO YOU AND WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY. &nbsp;ANY INFORMATION GATHERED BY US ABOUT YOU ON
THE SITES WILL BE PROTECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AS
APPLICABLE. &nbsp;UNLESS WE HAVE YOUR CONSENT,
WE WILL NOT SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTY
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Age Requirement</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">You must have reached the age of
majority in the jurisdiction in which you live to have our permission to use
this site. &nbsp;Our policy is that we do not
knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information about
visitors that are under the age of majority.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We are in compliance with the
requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), and we do not
collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. &nbsp;Our website and services are all directed to
people who are at least 13 years old or older.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Collection and Use of Your Personal Information</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">You may visit the Sites without
providing us with any of your personal information, but some of the services
that we make available through the Sites require that you provide us with
certain personal information such as your name, physical address, e-mail and
Web site address(es) and phone number(s). &nbsp;In addition, we may ask you to provide us
information regarding your citizenship, your employment and career requirements
and preferences, your skills, experience, salary history and other similar
information. &nbsp;For example, you will not
be able to enjoy certain benefits we offer unless you become a member of our
talent pool by registering within our Sites (such site(s) of registration and
participation being referred to herein as the “Talent Site”) by providing the
personal information that we request in the&nbsp;<a href="http://24seveninc.com/en-us/sign-up/" target="_blank">registration</a>&nbsp;section.&nbsp;
If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular benefit
or activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity and/or gain such
benefit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">By providing us with your
personal information when you become a member of the Talent Site you expressly consent
to our using such information to: (i) provide you with services in connection
with our operations as an employment/recruitment agency, (ii) contact you about
your membership account or account activity (including, without limitation,
setting up interviews with our recruitment specialists or potential employers),
(iii) send you information about the benefits of the Talent Site membership
(including, without limitation, our and our affiliates' and business partners'
products and services, unless you have opted out of receiving any such
information), and (iv) in aggregated form only, to market and promote the Sites
and our business generally (for example, to inform current and potential
clients regarding the number of job seekers with specific technical abilities
who have posted their resumes on the Talent Site).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Rest assured that we only
collect, use and share that personal information that you voluntarily and
knowingly submit to us through the Sites.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Collection and Use of Technical (Non-Personally-Identifiable)
Information</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When you visit the Sites, we may
also collect technical information that does not, by itself, identify you as a
specific individual. &nbsp;This information
(sometimes referred to as “non-personally identifiable information”) may
include the address of the Web site that you came from before visiting one of
the Sites, which pages you visit on the Sites, which browser you use to view
the Sites and, if search functionality is available on the Site, any search
terms that you may have entered. &nbsp;We may
also collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address an IP address is a number that
is automatically assigned to your computer, so Web servers can automatically
identify individual computers by their IP address - to help diagnose problems
with our servers, administer the Sites, see where the traffic on the Sites is
coming from or identify you as the user of a particular computer. &nbsp;Such collection of information also applies to
your mobile device, such as its unique device identifier.&nbsp; We may also collect other non-personally
identifiable information via the Sites, such as the Site's usage activity and
preferences, also known as demographic or profile data. &nbsp;We may match information collected from you
through different means or at different times, and use such information along
with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. &nbsp;We do not intend to combine this technical
data with your personally-identifiable information, but we reserve the right to
do so. &nbsp;We will use the information that
you provide to us solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>How We Use “Cookies” and Other Technologies</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“Cookies” are small pieces of
information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you
visit their Web sites. &nbsp;Like many other
Web sites, we use cookies on the Sites, for example, to identify you as a
registered user of the Talent Site so that you do not have to re-enter your
personal information upon each visit. &nbsp;Most
Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security
settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;Like other Web sites, we may also use other
tracking technologies (for example, Web bugs, e-mail bugs, clear GIFs, Web
beacons, or tracker GIFs) in the Sites and in our communications with you to
enhance the functionality of the Sites and to make your interactions and other
activities more convenient and efficient.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>What We May Share With or Otherwise Provide to Third Parties</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We do not provide access to your
personal information to third parties except as set forth in this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If we believe that your
qualifications match certain job postings or general needs of our clients, we
may share your resume with them, but the resume we disclose to them will have
your name, address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address deleted and
replaced with the address and other contact information of 24 Seven.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In addition, we may provide third
parties with aggregate statistics about traffic patterns, and related site
information. &nbsp;This data reflects site
usage patterns gathered during our users' visits to the Sites, but it does not
contain behavioral, profile, or identifying information about any personally
identified individual user. &nbsp;By using the
Sites, you give us permission to collect information about the pages served to
you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site
statistics. &nbsp;If you become a registered
member of the Talent Site, you authorize us to use the information you provide
there to personalize the information we deliver to you and to use your
demographic information when calculating aggregate user data.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Except as provided above, or as
required by applicable law, regulations, or court order, or to protect or defend
our rights or the rights or well-being of our users, or if you are involved (or
are reasonably suspected to be involved) in any illegal activity, even without
a subpoena, warrant or court order, or in connection with the sale of
substantially all the assets of 24 Seven or its merger, reorganization,
consolidation or liquidation, or in connection with specific services that you
have requested from us and that we have agreed to provide but may be providing
through third parties, or pursuant to your express prior consent, we will not
share with or disclose to third parties the personal information we collect
from you through the Sites.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Postings and Public Areas</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">You are solely responsible for
the information and other content you post on or through the Sites. &nbsp;You understand that personal and other
information (such as your name, e-mail address, phone number) that you post on
or through public areas of the Sites, if any, are generally accessible to, and
may be collected and used by, others and may result in unsolicited messages or
other contact from others. &nbsp;We encourage
you to exercise caution when providing personal information about you on any
public areas of the Sites, if any such areas are made available.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If you elect to use our referral
service to inform a third party about the Sites, or if you otherwise provide a
third party's personal information to us or to the Sites, you warrant that you
have permission to do so and you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our
affiliates harmless from and against any claim, liability, cost and expense (including
attorney’s fees) arising in any way there from.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Third Party Advertisements; Links to Third Party Sites</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Sites may contain
advertisements placed by third parties on the Sites, or links to third party
Web sites. &nbsp;For example, many of the
benefits that you can access by becoming a member of the Talent Site are
available directly from such third parties. &nbsp;The personal information we collect from you
on the Sites is not shared by us with such third parties, unless we
specifically tell you otherwise on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;In order to take advantage of such benefits,
you will have to go directly to the Web sites of the companies that provide
such benefits, and provide them with whatever information they request and
whatever information you wish to voluntarily provide to them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Just like we do, the third
parties who place advertisements on the Sites may use cookies, Web beacons and
other tracking technologies to collect your information when you click on their
advertisements, and each of the linked third party Web sites have their own
information collection and use practices and policies. &nbsp;We have no control over what information such
third parties may track or collect, how they conduct their tracking or
collection, or how they use the information they track or collect, and we
assume no responsibility or liability for any tracking, data collection or
other activities of any such third parties. &nbsp;Before you provide them with your personal
information, please make sure that you have read and understood their privacy
policies (and that you are also familiar and understand their specific Web site
terms and conditions of use). &nbsp;YOU HEREBY
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT GOVERN ANY THIRD
PARTY'S PRIVACY PRACTICES.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Opting Out</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our users are generally given the
opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not
directly related to the Sites at the point where we ask for information.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Notwithstanding the above, your
option not to receive promotional and marketing material shall not preclude us
from corresponding with you, by e-mail or otherwise, regarding your existing or
past relationship with us (such as, for example, your Talent Site membership activity,
your request that we grant you an interview, or that we place you in a job, or
our responses to questions or inquiries you pose to us), and shall not preclude
us from accessing and viewing your personal information in the course of
maintaining and improving the Sites and generally conducting our
employment/recruitment business.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Special Offers, Newsletter</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Established members of the Talent
Site may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals,
other promotional announcements, surveys and our newsletter. &nbsp;Out of respect for the privacy of our users we
present you with the option to not receive these types of communications in the
future.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Service Announcements</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On rare occasions it is necessary
to send out a strictly service related announcement that is not promotional in
nature. &nbsp;For instance, if our service is
temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send users an e-mail. &nbsp;Generally, you may not opt-out of these
communications, though you may always deactivate (cancel) your Talent Site
membership, in which case you will no longer receive such service
announcements.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Security</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Any personal data you enter on
the Sites when becoming a member of the Talent Site, or through any other means

regarding your potential placement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We use a variety of safeguards to
protect your sensitive information from loss, misuse, alteration or
destruction. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the above,
due to the open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any

of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity and

Your personal Information</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If at any time you wish to find
out what personal information we hold about you in our databases, or you wish
to access, correct, change, update or delete that information, you may do so by
logging onto the Talent Site and following the instructions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Consent to Processing</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">By providing any personal

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We reserve the right to change
this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or
deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof.<a name="_GoBack"></a>
&nbsp;In the event our Privacy Policy should
change, we will post those changes on the Privacy Policy Web page, with a
notice thereof on the homepage of the applicable Site, and in any other places
we deem appropriate so you are always aware of what information we collect, how
we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In general, we will use
information in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which
the information was collected. &nbsp;If,
however, we decide to use or disclose your personally identifiable information
in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will
generally notify you via e-mail prior to such use or disclosure of any such
information. &nbsp;You will have the opportunity
to opt-out of any change in the use of your information by e-mailing us
at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:membership@24seventalent.com" target="_blank">membership@24seventalent.com</a>.
&nbsp;However, if you have opted out of all
communication with the Sites (including Talent Site), or deleted/deactivated
your membership account with the Talent Site, then you will not be contacted,
nor will your personal information be used or disclosed in this new manner. &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
above, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not
affect user information already stored in our database, we will merely post a
prominent notice on the Sites notifying you of the change. &nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that it is your
responsibility to review the Sites and this Privacy Policy periodically and to
be aware of any modifications. &nbsp;Your
continued use of the Sites following the posting of changes means your
acceptance of those changes.</p>
