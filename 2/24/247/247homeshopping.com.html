  <h3>(2) Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie consists of a piece of text sent by a web server to a web browser, and 
    stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time 
    the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to 
    identify and track the web browser. </p>
  <p>We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We 
    will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the 
    website; and when you link out from our web site to any affiliate web site, 
    including, mobile platforms and tablets (or any other App system). We will use 
    the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; 
    and when you go to third party affiliate sites to enable a clear purchase track 
    if a purchase takes place. </p>
  <p>Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. 
    Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until 
    they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
  <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics 
    generates statistical and other information about website use by means of 
    cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated 
    relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. 
    Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: 
    http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</p>
  <p>Our affiliates / advertisers / payment services providers may also send you 
    cookies. </p>
  <p>Our internal as well as external advertising services providers may send you 
    cookies for the purpose of enabling the service of advertisements based on your 
    previous visits to our website. </p>
  <p>We DONT publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website but 
    if we did and may do in the future then. These are tailored by Google to reflect 
    your interests. To determine your interests, Google will track your behaviour on 
    our website and on other websites across the web using the DART cookie. You can 
    view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using 
    Google's Ads Preference Manager, available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. 
    You can opt-out of the Adsense partner network cookie at: http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/ 
    or using the NAI's (Network Advertising Initiative's) multi-cookie opt-out 
    mechanism at: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. However, 
    these opt-out mechanisms use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your 
    browser your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is 
    maintained in respect of a particular browser, you should use the Google browser 
    plug-in available at: http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin. </p>
  <p>Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to 
    reject just third party cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can 
    refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and 
    selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies 
    will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, on 
    ours it will mean that we CAN NOT track any purchasing data and any revenues 
    received without a clear track will NOT be distributed to the client even though 
    any other data might support this purchase. </p>
