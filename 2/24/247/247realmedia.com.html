<h3>Information We Collect Through our Services</h3>
<p><strong>We do not collect PII.</strong></p>
<p>We do not collect the online user’s personally identifiable information ("PII") through our Services.&nbsp; PII generally refers to information such as an individual’s name, mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services</strong></p>
<p align="left">We offer a range of Services that allow advertisers and publishers to show online users the most useful and relevant ads online.</p>
<p align="left">We may collect non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII") regarding the user’s behavior and usage patterns on advertisements and sites operated by our clients to better customize the type of advertisements users see on various sites.&nbsp; Non-PII may include information such as the type of Internet browser used by an online user, the type of computer operating system used, the domain name of the website visited, as well as information related to websites and web pages a user is viewing when an advertisement is shown.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies and pixels.&nbsp; No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.&nbsp; A cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser.&nbsp; A pixel is a line of code which is used by a Web site or third party ad server to track a user’s activity.&nbsp; The use of a pixel allows us to record that a user has visited a particular webpage along with additional Non-PII that the website publisher or advertiser may choose to include with the pixel.</p>
<p align="left">We require our clients to comply with applicable laws governing online privacy and encourage them to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used.&nbsp; We require our partner web sites that are part of Web Alliance to inform users about their privacy and information collection practices via their privacy policies, including whether or not the web site is using our technology, and a way to opt out from our storing the users’ data related to their website visits.&nbsp; We encourage you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>

<br>
We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our customers.&nbsp; This Non-PII may be used by our customers to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites.&nbsp; This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.&nbsp; Further, all of our customers have warranted that they shall use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.<br>
<br>
We may disclose a user’s information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>User Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies</h3>

<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of data.&nbsp; This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use.&nbsp; Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential information.&nbsp; Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to protect your data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security by an outside party.</p>
