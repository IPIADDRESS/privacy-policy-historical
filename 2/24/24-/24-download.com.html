		<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		<strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong><br>
		Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard 
		technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") 
		and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site 
		is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may 
		include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our 
		Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web 
		site. </span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">How Do We 
		Use the Information That You Provide to Us? </span></strong></p>
		<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Broadly speaking, 
		we use personal information for purposes of administering our business 
		activities, providing the products and services you requested, to 
		process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing 
		and promotional efforts and improve our content and service offerings, 
		and customize our site's content, layout, services and for other lawful 
		purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your 
		needs. </span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Furthermore, such 
		information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally 
		identifiable information or business information will not be shared with 
		parties except as required by law. </span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Occasionally, we 
		may also use the information we collect to notify you about important 
		changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you 
		will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to 
		receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided on the 
		newsletter. <br style="">
		<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">What Are 
		Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an 
		anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's 
		computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part 
		of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site 
		can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences 
		allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web 
		site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies 
		sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. 
		However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the 
		configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have 
		your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site 
		will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. </span><b>
		<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">A cookie cannot 
		retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer 
		viruses. </span></b></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">How Do We 
		Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to 
		differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies 
		to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for 
		security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow 
		us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and 
		which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback 
		to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies 
		do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do 
		not intentionally store any personal information that your browser 
		provided to us in your cookies. </span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">IP 
		Addresses</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to 
		the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on 
		the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically 
		collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data 
		known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) 
		can be sent to you. </span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Sharing 
		and Selling Information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that 
		uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal 
		details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process 
		transactions or provide services that you have requested. </span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">How Can 
		You Access and Correct Your Information?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		You may request access to all your personally identifiable information 
		that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at 
		<a href="mailto:lists@24-download.com">lists@24-download.com</a> </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">What About 
		Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
		</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">We may 
		disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, 
		when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the 
		protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information 
		when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
		necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who 
		may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our 
		users and the Public. </span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">What About 
		Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to 
		or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. 
		Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to 
		information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.
		<br style="">
		<br style="">
&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Please remember 
		that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web site, our 
		Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on 
		any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our 
		Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please 
		read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Your 
		Consent</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma"><br>
		By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your 
		personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the 
		right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.

		<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">Please note that 
		your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the 
		United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States 
		may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or 
		citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and

		physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure 
		the information we collect online. </span></p>

		code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners 
		and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of 
		monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </span>

		<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma">A Special Note
