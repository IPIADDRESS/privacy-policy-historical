We have adopted this privacy policy to explain how we collect, store, and use the information collected in connection with the Site. THIS PRIVACY POLICY SUPPLEMENTS THE PRIVACY DISCLOSURES PROVIDED TO YOU WITH YOUR GAME AND/OR BY YOUR CONSOLE MANUFACTURER. All of these policies and disclosures are collectively referred to in this document as the “Privacy Policy”. </p>    <p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seal located on this page to your right confirms that 2K is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and 2K has been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our site and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB. </p>  <p>Whenever you visit a Web site that displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of:</p>                                <p>1. The scope of this Privacy Policy<br>2. How information is collected<br>3. Exactly what personal information may be collected<br>4. The consequences, if any, resulting from your refusal to provide personal information<br>5. Whether 2K uses cookies, tracks IP Addresses or uses other passive means to collect information<br>6. Who, if anyone, is collecting your personal information and how it will be used<br>7. With whom, if anyone, will your personal information be shared<br>8. What choices you have with regard to the use of your personal information<br>9. How you can opt-out of data display via the Site and access, change, or delete the personal information 2K collects and maintains<br>10. What about links to other parties<br>11. Whether and how information is collected from Children under 13<br>12. How 2K ensures data security, quality, and integrity<br>13. Where information is stored<br>14. What other terms apply<br>15. How to ask questions or file a complaint </p>      <p><strong>What does this Privacy Policy apply to?<br></strong>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site located at <strong>www.2ksports.com</strong>. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other 2K web sites (even those that are referenced on, or linked to through, the Site) or websites maintained by other companies or organizations. </p>      <p>By using and submitting personal information to the Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on the Site and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change. Your continued use of the Site will signify your acceptance of these changes. </p>      <p><strong>How does 2K collect information?<br></strong>In connection with its games and the Site, 2K collects information from you in three ways. </p>    <p>1. When you play certain 2K games (such as NHL 2K9 or NBA 2K9), information about your game play may be collected and transmitted to 2K through Xbox LIVE, PLAYSTATION®Network, or any other internet connection method using the hardware on which you play such games (collectively and individually your “Internet Connection”). Information about game play may be collected while you are offline and transmitted to 2K when you next make an Internet Connection whether or not you are currently logged into your Internet Connection from your console, handheld, computer, or other gaming platform. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>2K may use such information in connection with the Site as set forth in this Privacy Policy whether or not you register on or use the Site. </p>    <p>2. You may choose to voluntarily provide us with various personal information and non-personal information through your use of the Site. </p>    <p>3. We may automatically collect certain non-personal information from you in connection with your use of the Site. </p>        <p>The Site uses the Microsoft Windows Live ID service, which provides authentication for online sign in, to associate your Site account with your Xbox LIVE Gamertag. </p>        <p><strong>What information does 2K collect?<br></strong>If you make an Internet Connection, 2K may receive information regarding your game play and console usage without any additional notice to you or actions taken by you. 2K will not receive personal information such as your name and address but may receive other information such as your Playstation ID or Xbox Live ID, Game achievements, Game scores and performance, Internet Protocol (IP) address, other console use information, or other information and statistics regarding your usage of the games. </p>    <p>When you register and use the Site, you may voluntarily provide, and 2K may collect, personal and non-personal information in the form of website registration data (name, address, email, etc), Xbox Gamertag, and other data necessary to fulfill your requests, participate in game-specific services, and participate in special services such as newsletter subscriptions, “email this page” features, technical support, demos, downloads, polls, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions. &nbsp;2K may also collect and display information that could indicate your presence online. &nbsp;2K may also passively collect certain information about your use of the Site, such as the pages you visit and the features you use (see “Cookies” below). </p>      <p><strong>A Special Note about our Message Boards and Chat Rooms<br></strong>Whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on a message board or chat room, that information can be collected and used by other people. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these services, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you post in these areas. </p>          <p><strong>E-mail Correspondence<br></strong>We may provide e-mail addresses or forms to which visitors can send us questions or comments, or which visitors can use to request customer support. In the process of receiving and responding to such requests, we may collect personal information about you, such as your e-mail address or any other personal data contained in the body of your e-mail message. By allowing you to send us these requests, we are not attempting to solicit personal information from you. We only use the information for the purpose of responding to your questions and/or comments or to provide customer support. In most cases, your message is deleted immediately after we've resolved your inquiry; however, in some instances, hard copies of your requests may be kept on file for our records or for quality control purposes. If we have actual knowledge that the person with whom we're communicating is a child, we delete the child's e-mail address and message immediately after responding.<strong> <br></strong></p>      <p><strong>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?<br></strong>Your refusal to submit personal information may limit your ability to participate in some activities on the Site. However, as described above, the Site may nonetheless post game play boards that contain certain information as a result of your use of the games. </p>          <p><strong>Does 2K &nbsp;use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?</strong><br>2K may use cookies and similar tracking devices on the Site. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user's computer. Cookies generally do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit (such as the user’s use of various features on the service). You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain portions of the Site. </p>    <p>2K may also keep track of your Internet Protocol (IP) and computer MAC addresses for various reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A computer MAC address identifies one specific piece of hardware. </p>        <p>Other information that may be passively collected by 2K includes log files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These entries are generated anonymously and enable 2K to assess overall online activity and a user’s browsing habits, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. </p>      <p><strong>Who is collecting my information and how will it be used?<br></strong>When you submit information on the Site, or information is automatically collected as described in this Privacy Policy, that information is received by 2K. 2K uses the submitted information to send you promotional materials, to provide you with access to our services, to fulfill product orders, and to respond to questions or technical problems. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. &nbsp;Members of the Site may be automatically entered into contests as a result of their membership and/or use of certain services. Check <strong>www.2ksports.com/team2k</strong> frequently for details regarding contests. Potential winners may be required to fill out certain documents to claim a prize and any potential winner may refuse to do so which will forfeit the prize. Check the contest rules for details. </p>    <p>The Site by its very nature is an open community where information is publicly posted for other people to see. Therefore, 2K will post certain information automatically on the Site in public portions of the site, such as your Screen Name/ ID/Gamertag, PLAYSTATION®Network ID, and game play statistics. &nbsp;However, we will not post information that we know directly and clearly identifies you (such as your real name or email address) unless you provide that information voluntarily for such use. As with other game play information services, game play and “leader” boards hosted by the Site may appear nested in third-party webpages via frames or widgets. </p>    <p>We may match information automatically collected through your use of the games with information collected through the Site. This combined information may then appear on public portions of the Site. </p>    <p>From time to time, 2K may employ vendors to perform services on 2K's behalf. These vendors provide internal support to 2K by operating some of the services we provide you. Although these vendors, not 2K, may collect, use or maintain the information in connection with the Site, 2K still requires that they adhere to 2K’s stated privacy policies and that they not share your personal information with third parties.&nbsp;  </p>        <p><strong>With whom does 2K share my personal information?</strong><br>2K does not share your personal information with any third parties, except to fulfill a request you have made. &nbsp;In the event we offer services or promotions where your information is separately collected and used according to the privacy policy of a third-party, we will inform you of that at the time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or promotion. &nbsp;We also may share your information with third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event involving all or a portion of 2K, 2K’s customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign. </p>    <p><strong>How you can control the collection, use, and/or display of data by 2K<br></strong>If you do not want 2K to send you communications such as newsletters or promotional offers, you may opt-out from receiving these communications at the time your personal information is collected or later by contacting us:</p>          <p>By phone at <strong>646-536-2842</strong> (in the USA)<br>Via email at <strong>privacypolicy@take2games.com</strong> (subject “Unsubscribe”); or,<br>By regular mail at <strong>Take Two Interactive Software, Inc., 622 Broadway, New York, New York 10012.</strong> </p>    <p>In addition, along with every communication sent to you, 2K gives you the opportunity to discontinue receiving future communications. </p>    <p>If you want to delete your account registration information from the Site, please use these same methods to contact us and put “Account Deletion” in the subject line of your email. </p>    <p>If you do not want your game play information to publicly appear via the Site, then you should visit <a href="http://www.2ksports.com/community/user/editaccount.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.2ksports.com/community/user/editaccount.cfm</a> and follow the instructions to opt out of our game play information services. Please note that, even if you opt-out of participation in the Site, your game play information may still appear on game play boards hosted by Microsoft or Sony (including copies of those boards hosted on the Site) and 2K will continue to collect and store information regarding your usage of its games for internal purposes.&nbsp;    </p><p><strong>How do I access, change, or delete my personal information?<br></strong>If for any reason you wish to view, correct or delete the personal information collected about you, please send an email to<strong> privacypolicy@take2games.com</strong>, or write to us at&nbsp; <strong>Take Two Interactive Software, Inc., Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator</strong>, <strong>622 Broadway, New York, New York 10012</strong>. We will review, update or remove information as appropriate.&nbsp;  </p>      <p><strong>What is 2K’s policy regarding links to other sites?</strong><br>You should be aware that while you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend reading the privacy policy of the website you link to before you submit any of your personal information. </p>      <p><strong>Does 2K collect personal information from children under 13?</strong><br>2K does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years old. We encourage parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet.&nbsp;      </p><p><strong>What safeguards does 2K use to protect my personal information?<br></strong>To protect your personal information, 2K maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. The Site has security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Personal information collected by 2K is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public (e.g., locked rooms). To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal information, 2K maintains information collected online behind a firewall-protected server and uses SSL encryption for purchases made through our online store. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite our reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your information. By using our services, you assume this risk.&nbsp;      </p><p><strong>Storing and/or Exporting Data to the United States<br></strong>All data collected or received by 2K in connection with the Site is collected in or exported to the United  States of America and stored on servers located in the United States. By using our services, you expressly consent to us exporting such data to, and storing such data in, the United   States. The laws of the United States shall govern the use of such data and not the laws where you may be located.&nbsp;      </p><p><strong>Other terms<br></strong>Use of the games may be subject to other terms, conditions and disclosures prescribed by 2K, Microsoft, and/or Sony, including the Limited Software Warranty; License Agreement and Privacy Disclosure that accompanied the purchase of the game, terms and conditions that appear on the Site, other terms and disclosures which are made available to you by 2K, and the terms, conditions, and disclosures made available to you by Microsoft and/or Sony in connection with the use of their consoles and online services. All such terms, conditions and disclosures are incorporated by reference into this Online Privacy Statement.&nbsp;        </p><p><strong>How do I ask a question or file a complaint?</strong><br>Any questions or complaints about this Online Privacy Statement can be resolved by contacting our Privacy Policy Administrator at 646-536-2842; via email at <strong>privacypolicy@take2games.com</strong>; or, by regular mail at <strong>Take Two Interactive Software, Inc., Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator</strong>, <strong>622 Broadway, New York, New York 10012</strong>. </p>    <p>2K is a licensee of the ESRB's Privacy Online Program. If you believe that we have not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact ESRB at <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/contact.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.esrb.org/privacy/contact.jsp</a> </p>            <p>ESRB<br>Attn: Privacy Online Program<br>317 Madison   Avenue, 22nd Floor<br>New York,  NY 10017<br>212-759-0700<br>privacy@esrb.org</p>&nbsp;
