          <td><p align="justify">Your privacy on the Internet is important to 
              us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users 
              of 21food's network of sites and services, we believe you should 
              fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture 
              and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what 
              information we gather and how we use it. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> 21food collects information from our users at 
              several different points on our web sites. Wherever we collect personal 
              information, we include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 
              When you register with one of our sites or sign up to receive one 
              of our newsletters, 21food may ask for your contact information 
              (such as your email address) and your demographic information (such 
              as your zip code, industry, and job function). We use demographic 
              information to tailor your experience at our web site, showing you 
              content and advertisements that we think might interest you. 21food 
              may also ask for such information at other times, such as when you 
              request information or when you decide to purchase products or services 
              from 21food and/or our customers and suppliers. The information 
              collected by 21food may be used in a number of ways. For example, 
              21food will share broad aggregated demographic information with 
              our partners and advertisers. An example would be where 21food provides 
              partners and advertisers with information about the percentage of 
              men or women who visit our sites, or about the types of industries 
              that users come from. 21food's goal in collecting personal information 
              is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized web experience 
              possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the 
              right audience. By knowing a little about you, 21food is able to 
              deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better 
              service, to you. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Newsletter Subscription</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> We may send new registrants and subscribers a 
              welcoming email. We ask our new subscribers in the welcoming email 
              to then confirm their new subscription to the newsletter as a way 
              of protecting them from unwanted emails. New members receive newsletters 
              and product updates from 21food only if they follow the confirmation 
              instructions in the welcoming email. If new members do not wish 
              to receive such newsletters and updates, they do not need to take 
              any action. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Promotion and Direct Mail</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> Our web sites provide you with the choice to receive 
              promotional emails from 21food. If you choose to receive promotional 
              emails from 21food, you will be giving 21food permission to access 
              your information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing 
              or promotional purposes. We will not share your information with 
              our partners unless you have opted in to receive promotional emails 
              from such partners. If you have chosen to receive such emails and 
              later change your mind, you can remove yourself from this distribution 
              list via a link in the communication or by unsubscribing at this 
              site. 21food and/or its partners may also send direct mailings to 
              your postal address from time to time. If you do not want to receive 
              direct mailings from 21food and/or its partners, you can remove 
              yourself from this distribution list by notifying us through the 
              link set forth below. In addition to 21food, agents working on behalf 
              of 21food under confidentiality agreements, and certain suppliers 
              who are in contract with 21food, may send you carefully selected 
              e-mails or direct mailings about products and services that may 
              be of interest to you. 21food does not control or monitor the newsletter 
              and/or direct mailings or product updates sent by these suppliers. 
              If you do not wish to receive the promotional e-mails or direct 
              mailings set forth above, please click here to opt-out. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Orders</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> If you make a purchase through our site, the information 
              obtained during your visit to the site, and the information that 
              you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, 
              is used for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble 
              processing an order, this contact information is used to get in 
              touch with the user. In addition, this contact information is provided 
              to third party suppliers and/or fulfillment agents that service 
              your orders and requests. Credit card information will be shared 
              with third parties only as necessary in order to provide the products 
              and services you order. Your contact information may also be provided 
              to the suppliers of content for free downloads of white papers, 
              software or other resources from any 21food websites. These third 
              party suppliers, fulfillment agents and merchants have separate 
              privacy and data collection practices, and 21food has no responsibility 
              or liability for these independent policies. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Links</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> This web site may contain links to other sites. 
              Please be aware that 21food is not responsible for the privacy practices 
              of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
              leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
              web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
              privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this

            <p align="justify"> If a user elects to use our referral service for 
              informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's 
              email address. 21food will automatically send the friend an email 
              inviting them to visit the site. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> When our registration/order form asks users to 
              enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social 
              security number), that information is encrypted and is protected 
              with the best encryption software in the industry. We use secure 
              servers to protect all of your personal information, including your 
              name, address, email and credit card information. It is generally 
              considered safer than giving your information over the phone. We 
              process your credit card number over our secure server that is the 
              industry standard. Whenever we transmit any credit card information, 
              we use a completely secure transmission method. In order to further 
              protect your personal information, we store your credit card number 
              in a separate location from your registration information. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Site and Service Updates</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> We also send the user site and service announcement 
              updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, 
              which contain important information about the service. We communicate 
              with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues 
              relating to their account via email or phone. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Notification of Changes; Conflicts</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we 
              will post those changes here so our users are always aware of what 
              information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
              if any, we disclose it. This page reflects the most up-to-date version 
              of our privacy policy, and thus takes precedence over information 
              provided in P3P documents and other documents. </p>
