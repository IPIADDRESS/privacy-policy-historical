          <p class="lm">How We May  Use Information</p>
          <ol>
            <li>General: We use your Collected  Information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically  analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to  customize our Site's content, layout and service specifically for you. We may  use your Collected Information to service your Account with us, including but  not limited to investigating problems, resolving disputes and enforcing  agreements with us. We do not sell, rent, trade or exchange any personally-identifying  information of our Users. We may share certain aggregate information based on  analysis of Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers or  potential Users. We may use your Collected Information to execute marketing  campaigns, promotions or advertising messages on behalf of third parties;  however, in these circumstances, your Collected Information will not be  disclosed to such third parties unless you respond to the marketing, promotion  or advertising message.</li>
         
            <li>Registration Information: We may use  your Registration Information to provide services that you request or to  contact you regarding additional services about which 21Food.com determines  that you might be interested. Specifically, we may use your email address,  mailing address, phone number or fax number to contact you regarding notices,  surveys, product alerts, new service or product offerings and communications  relevant to your use of our Site. We may generate reports and analysis based on  the Registration Information for internal analysis, monitoring and marketing  decisions. </li>
         
          <li>Publishing Information: All of your  Publishing Information will be publicly available on the Site and therefore  accessible by any internet user.

You should exercise caution when deciding to  include personal or proprietary information in the Publishing Information that  you submit to us. </li>
         
            <li>Statistical Information: We use  Statistical Information to help diagnose problems with and maintain our  computer servers, to manage our Site, and to enhance our Site and services  based on the usage pattern data we receive. We may generate reports and  analysis based on the Statistical Information for internal analysis, monitoring  and marketing decisions. We may provide Statistical Information to third  parties, but when we do so, we do not provide personally-identifying  information without your permission.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="lm">Disclosure of Information</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to disclose your  Collected Information to relevant authorities where we have reason to believe  that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be infringing or threatening to infringe, or who may  otherwise be causing injury to or interference with, the title, rights,  interests or property of 21Food.com, our Users, customers, partners, other web  site users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
          <p>We also reserve the right to disclose  Collected Information in response to a subpoena or other judicial order or when  we reasonably believe that such disclosure is required by law, regulation or  administrative order of any court, governmental or regulatory authority.</p>
          <p>If we have reason to believe that a User is  in breach of the Terms of User Agreement or any other agreement with us, then  we reserve the right to make public or otherwise disclose such User's Collected  Information in order to pursue our claim or prevent further injury to 21Food or  others.</p>
          <p class="lm">Co-Branded  Relationships </p>
          <p>We have established relationships with  other parties to offer you the benefit of other products and services which we  ourselves do not offer. We offer you access to these other parties either  through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from our Site, or through offering  "co-branded" sites in which both ourselves and these other parties  share the same uniform resource locator, domain name or pages within a domain  name on the Internet. In some cases you may be required to submit information  for purposes of registering or applying for products or services provided by  such third parties or co-branded partners. The privacy policy of such other  parties may differ from ours, and we may not have any control over the  information that you submit to such third parties or co-branded sites. We  therefore encourage you to read that policy before responding to any offers,  products or services provided by such other parties. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="lm">Cookies</span></p>
          <p>We use "cookies" to store  specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. It is not  uncommon for websites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users.  A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and  stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can be sent to your computer's  hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer. If you do not  de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access  our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in  turn we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.  Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to access your  Registration Information, Publishing Information or Payment Information so you  do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by  Users; research visiting patters and help target advertisements based on User  interests; assist our partners to track User visits to the Site and process  orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. </p>
          <p>You can determine if and how a cookie will  be accepted by configuring your browser's which is installed in the computer  you are using to access the Site. If you desire, you can change those  configurations in your browser. By setting your preferences in the browser, you  can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is sent, or you can  reject all cookies. If you reject all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling  function in your browser, you may be required to re-enter your information on  our Site more often and certain features of our Site may be unavailable. </p>
          <p class="lm">Minors</p>
          <p>The Site and its contents are not intended  to be targeted to minors under applicable law and we do not intend to sell any  of our products or services to minors. However, we have no way of  distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Site and so we carry out  the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a minor has provided us  with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or  guardian should contact us to remove the information. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="lm">Security  Measures</span></p>
          <p>We employ commercially reasonable security  methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure  correct use of information. </p>
          <p>As a Registered User, your Registration  Information, Publishing Information and Payment  Information (if any) can be viewed and edited through your Account which  is protected by Password. We recommend that you do not divulge your Password to  anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited  phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you share a computer with others,  you should not choose to save your log-in information (e.g., User ID and  Password) on the computer. Remember to sign out of your Account and close your  browser window when you have finished your session. </p>
          <p>No data transmission over the Internet or  any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while  we try to protect your information, no web site or company, including  ourselves, can absolutely ensure or guarantee the security of any information  you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. </p>
          <p class="lm">Changes to  Privacy Policy</p>
          <p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be  communicated through our posting an amended and restated Privacy Policy on 21Food.com  Site. Our posting the amended and restated Privacy Policy will make such new  Privacy Policy immediately effective. You agree that all Collected Information  (whether or not collected prior to or after the new policy became effective)  will be governed by the newest Privacy Policy then in effect. If you do not  agree to the new changes in our Privacy Policy, you should contact 21Food.com  in writing (at the address set out in the Notice provision of the Terms of Use  Agreement) and specifically request that 21Food.com return and/or destroy all  copies of all or part of your Collected Information in 21Food.com's possession.  This Privacy Policy was last amended on August 23,  2006. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="lm">Correcting  Your Information </span></p>
