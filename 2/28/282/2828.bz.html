This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of the 2828.bz site ("Site") and the collection, use, transfer and processing of your Collected Information by 2828.bz and those affiliates

The Information We Collect Registration Information: At the time you register to become a Registered User of the Site, you will be asked to complete a registration form which requires you provide information such as your name, address, phone/fax number, email address and other personal information as well as information about your business ("Registration Information.") Publishing Information: If you submit any information to 2828.bz to be published on the Site through the publishing tools, including but not limited to Company Profile, Product Catalog, Trade Leads, then you are deemed to have given consent to the publication of such information ("Publishing Information"). <br> <br>

Statistical Information: In addition, we gather aggregate statistical information about our Site and Users, such as IP addresses, browser software, operating system, pages viewed, number of sessions, unique visitors and so forth. ("Statistical Information"). <br><br>

Registration Information: Publishing Information, Payment Information, Statistical Information and any information 
we may collect from you through the use of cookies (see Section 5 below), or any other means, shall collectively be 
referred to as "Collected Information". 
<br> <br>

We May Use Information <br>

General: We use your Collected Information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout and service specifically for you. We may use your Collected Information to service your Account with us, including but not limited to investigating problems, resolving disputes and enforcing agreements with us. We do not sell, rent, trade or exchange any personally-identifying information of our Users. We may provide your Collected Information to our affiliates and service providers under contract (such as customer care) to support the operation of the Site and our services. We may share 
certain aggregate information based on analysis of Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers or potential Users. We may use your Collected Information to execute marketing campaigns, promotions or advertising messages on behalf of third parties; however, in these circumstances, your Collected Information 
will not be disclosed to such third parties unless you respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising message. 

<br> <br>
Your Collected Information may be transferred, stored, used and processed outside your home jurisdiction. 
In case of a merger with or transfer of business to another business entity, we will transfer your Collected Information 
to the entity which acquires the business (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined 
entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your Collected Information). <br> <br>


Registration Information: We may use your Registration Information to provide services that you 
request or to contact you regarding additional services about which 2828.bz determines that you might be interested. 
Specifically, we may use your email address, mailing address, phone number or fax number to contact you regarding

We may generate reports and analysis based on the Registration Information for internal analysis, 
monitoring and marketing decisions. <br>
 <br>


Publishing Information: All of your Publishing Information will be publicly available on the Site 
and therefore accessible by any internet user. Any Publishing Information that you disclose to 2828.bz becomes public 
information and you relinquish any proprietary rights (including but not limited to the rights of confidentiality and copyrights) 
in such information. You should exercise caution when deciding to include personal or proprietary information 
in the Publishing Information that you submit to us.

to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide personally-identifying information without your permission.

<br> <br>
Disclosure of Information
We reserve the right to disclose your Collected Information to relevant authorities where we have reason to 
believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may 
be infringing or threatening to infringe, or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with, 
the title, rights, interests or property of 2828.bz, our Users, customers, partners, other web site users 
or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.

<br> <br>

We also reserve the right to disclose Collected Information in response to a subpoena or other 
judicial order or when we reasonably believe that such disclosure is required by law, regulation or 
administrative order of any court, governmental or regulatory authority.

<br> <br>


If we have reason to believe that a User is in breach of the Terms of User Agreement or any other agreement with us, 
then we reserve the right to make public or otherwise disclose such User's Collected Information in order to
pursue our claim or prevent further injury to 2828.br or others.

<br> <br>
Cookies
We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. It is not uncommon 
for websites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is 
sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive 
only if you access our Site using the computer. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the 
same computer to access our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we may have 
knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage. Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to access 
your Registration Information, Publishing Information or Payment Information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather 
statistical information about usage by Users; research visiting patters and help target advertisements based on User interests; 
assist our partners to track User visits to the Site and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. 

<br> <br>

You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your browser's which is installed in the 
computer you are using to access the Site. If you desire, you can change those configurations in your browser. 
By setting your preferences in the browser, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is sent, 
or you can reject all cookies. If you reject all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your browser, 
you may be required to re-enter your information on our Site more often and certain features of our Site may be unavailable. 

<br> <br>
Minors
The Site and its contents are not intended to be targeted to minors under applicable law and we do not intend to sell any of our products or services to minors. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Site and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information. 

<br> <br>
Security Measures
We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and 
ensure correct use of information. 

<br> <br>
As a Registered User, your Registration Information, Publishing Information and Payment Information (if any) can be 
viewed and edited through your Account which is protected by Password. We recommend that you do not divulge your 
Password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. 
If you share a computer with others, you should not choose to save your log-in information (e.g., User ID and Password) 
on the computer. Remember to sign out of your Account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. 

<br> <br>
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, 
while we try to protect your information, no web site or company, including ourselves, can absolutely ensure or 
guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. 


<br> <br>
Changes to Privacy Policy 
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated through our posting an amended and restated Privacy Policy 
on our Site. Our posting the amended and restated Privacy Policy will make such new Privacy Policy immediately effective. 
You agree that all Collected Information (whether or not collected prior to or after the new policy became effective) 
will be governed by the newest Privacy Policy then in effect. If you do not agree to the new changes in our Privacy Policy, 
you should contact 2828.bz in writing (at the address set out in the Notice provision of the Terms of Use Agreement) 
and specifically request that 2828.bz return and/or destroy all copies of all or part of your Collected Information
