                      <strong><u>PRIVACY POLICY</u></strong><br>
                    Thank you for visiting!  We appreciate the opportunity to interact with you on the Internet and are committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we might collect about you when you visit our Site, how we may use that information, how we disclose it to third parties, and the choices you have regarding our use of and your ability to correct that information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                      <strong><u>What Information We Collect and How We Use It</u></strong><br>

                    Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You may however, voluntarily provide the following Personally Identifiable Information:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Contact information, such as name, email address, and physical address.
                      <br>
                      <br>

                    We will maintain a record of your Personally Identifiable Information that will be sold or transferred to third parties that we believe offer products, services, and/or opportunities that are consistent with your expressed interests. Note that if you voluntarily provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, you consent to our sale, transfer, and use of your information.
                    <br>
                      <br>
                    <br>
                      <strong><u>Aggregate Information:</u></strong> Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") or the Web site that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.<br> 

                      <br>
                    We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong><u>Marketing</u></strong><br>
                    We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to direct to you information, offers, products, and/or services from us and/or a third party. Your Personally Identifiable Information may, therefore, ultimately be used for marketing purposes by us and/or any one or more the third parties with which we work.<br>
                    <br>
                      <strong><u>Sharing Your Information</u></strong><br>

                    As disclosed above, we may sell or transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with other related entities and/or business partners that provide services to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>This Private Policy only applies to the Personally Identifiable Information that you disclose on the website. The Privacy Policy does not apply to third parties, such as companies to whom we sell, transfer, and/or share your Personally Identifiable Information. Since we are unable to control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies. We are not responsible for any information you provide to third parties.</strong>
                    <br>
                    
                     <br>
                     <strong>Some third parties may be licensed to use our trademarks or service marks. The use of our trademarks or service marks is for reference or display purposes only. </strong> Note that if you voluntarily provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, you understand and agree that we are not responsible or liable for any information you choose to provide to third parties in the future.<br>
                     From time to time, we may release or share with our corporate family Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use, to investigate unlawful activities, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. We may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

                      <br>
                    This site or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or their respective assets could be acquired.

However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your Personally Identifiable Information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, we cannot promise, and you should not expect that your Personally Identifiable Information or private communications will always remain private. Moreover, this Privacy Policy only addresses the information that we collect from you.<strong> This Private Policy does not apply to the Personally Identifiable Information that you disclose to others, such as bidders, buyers, or sellers on the Site or any other sites throughout the Internet. Since we are unable to control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties to whom you elect to disclose your information. </strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                      <strong><u>Your Choices</u></strong><br>
                    Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.  <br>
                    <br>

                      <strong><u>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</u></strong><br>
                    We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our Site is accurate and reliable for its intended use. However, after your information is sold to third parties, we can no longer access or review or correct your information. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                      <strong><u>Protecting Your Information</u></strong><br>

                      <strong><u>Use of Information Obtained from Site</u></strong><br>
                    We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your Personally Identifiable Information once we sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties.

                      <strong><u>Use of Cookies On This Site</u></strong><br>
                    A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a Web site to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes.

Accepting a cookie does not provide access to your computer or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other than the information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, nor can they be used to deliver a virus.<br>
