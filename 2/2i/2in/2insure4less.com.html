</div><p><strong><span class="heading">Why do we collect your information?</span></strong> We help consumers shop for insurance and various other  products by connecting consumers with insurance agents or other vendors, as applicable. By clicking "<em>Get My Quotes</em>" and seeking a quote request,  you authorize and agree that we may use the information you share with  us to help match you with insurance providers or other vendors (as  applicable) through introducing you to insurance agents, insurance  companies, and/or other vendors, as applicable, who also assist us  and you in finding insurance agents, insurance companies, discount  program representatives and/or other requested products or services,  as applicable (we refer to all of these as "<em><span class="term">Providers</span></em>",  and we sometimes refer to both consumers and Providers as our "<em><span class="term">users</span></em>")  to help you obtain free quotes for insurance, discount health plans  or other products or services, as applicable.  Insurance companies  establish their rates using a variety of criteria. Since we deal  with many Providers, the more detailed information you provide to us,  the more accurate a quote our Providers may help you locate.   By clicking "Get My Quotes" you also agree to this  Privacy Policy and consent to your receipt of insurance quote reminders  and special promotions via email from: member@myinsurancequotefinder.com. If you no longer wish to  receive promotional emails from us you may opt-out at any time by  using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email  communication or contact us at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=unsubscribe@allwebleads.com" target="_blank">unsubscribe@allwebleads.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">Newsletters</span> </strong>If you elect to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and  email address to send the newsletter to you.  If you no longer wish to receive  our newsletter, you may opt-out at any time by following the instructions included in each newsletter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="bigheading">INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">What do we collect and how do we use it?</span></strong> By clicking "Get My Quotes" and requesting an insurance quote,  you acknowledge and agree that up to eight (8) Providers may contact you  using your information to provide your requested quote or to obtain  additional information needed to provide your requested quotes where  permitted by law. You further acknowledge and agree that each Provider  that receives your quote request from this website or our affiliates may  confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may  include your credit score and driving record. You acknowledge that you  have read and understand the Terms and Conditions of Use of this website  and agree to be bound by them. We are not responsible, and shall not be  held liable, if a Provider or other third party to whom we have forwarded  any of the information you submitted to us violates our Privacy Policy  or such third party's own privacy policy (if any), or otherwise  violates the law.</p>
<p>Our users may from time-to-time provide us with personally  identifiable information. Personally identifiable information  generally means any information that may be used to identify an  individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address,  telephone number, and email address.</p>
<p>Examples of personally identifiable information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and Last Name</li>
<li>Postal Address</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Driver's License Number*</li>
<li>Date of Birth</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* While not required, this information may be helpful in processing your request to receive insurance or other quotations.</em></p>
<p>Certain of our users requesting quotations for health insurance may also be asked to provide certain personal health information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major Health Conditions</li>
<li>Prescription Medications you or a family member may be taking</li>
<li>Whether or not you have been hospitalized in the past 5 years</li>
<li>Whether or not you have been treated by a doctor for a major health condition in the past year</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We process personally identifiable information as described herein and also for such purposes as:</p>
<ul>
<li>To deliver our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
<li>To conduct research and analysis in order to maintain and improve our products and services;</li>
<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our system and network;</li>
<li>To aid us in developing new services;</li>
<li>To alert you to product updates, special offers, updated information and other new services. (You may opt-out of these communications if you so choose.)</li>
<li>To contact you in response to your requests for information; and</li>
<li>To provide you quotes from up to 8 Providers who may contact you using the information you provide or to obtain additional information needed to provide quotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we may aggregate information we receive from you and from our  other users and may use or disclose such aggregate information to third  parties in a manner that does not disclose any individual user's  personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><span class="heading"><strong>Affiliate Sign up</strong> </span> If you wish to register as an affiliate we collect your name, company name,  email address and phone number. We use this information for contacting  potential affiliates to determine the potential for a business relationship.  We do not disclose this information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES</span></strong><br> AS STATED ABOVE, BY CLICKING "GET MY QUOTES" AND SEEKING A QUOTE REQUEST, YOU AUTHORIZE AND AGREE THAT A PROVIDER MAY OBTAIN ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR REQUESTED INSURANCE QUOTE OR POLICY INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSUMER AND/OR CREDIT REPORTS, OR DRIVING RECORDS, MAY BE ORDERED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR QUOTE REQUEST. THESE REPORTS MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY ASSIST PROVIDERS IN DETERMINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR INSURANCE, DISCOUNT HEALTH PLANS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND RATES THAT YOU MAY BE CHARGED. CONSUMER REPORTS MAY ALSO BE USED FOR UPDATES, RENEWALS, OR EXTENSIONS OF ANY INSURANCE YOU MAY OBTAIN. A PROVIDER MAY ALSO OBTAIN AND USE A CREDIT-BASED INSURANCE SCORE CONTAINED IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT. THIS INFORMATION MAY BE COMBINED BY A PROVIDER WITH INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US, AND BY CLICKING SUBMIT AND SEEKING A QUOTE REQUEST, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR WRITTEN PERMISSION TO OUR PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN YOUR CREDIT REPORT.</p>
<p><strong><span class="bigheading">USAGE TRACKING</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">Usage Data Generally</span>.</strong> Like many internet companies, we track website and service usage data to  improve the services we offer and the security of your interaction with  the site. We collect user traffic patterns throughout our website. This  information is collected to help improve website flow and usability. In  addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to  our website from the reports and emails we send to our users. This is  done to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to  discourage fraudulent use and to improve the security of our site and  your interaction with the site.</p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">Cookies</span>. </strong>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The  cookie will enable us to relate your use of this website to information  that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personally  identifiable information a cookie can contain is information that you  yourself supply. We do not store personally identifiable information in cookies.   A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created  by other websites that are not owned by us. We may use cookies to track  user traffic patterns (as described above). In addition, we may use encrypted  cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs onto any  portion of our website requiring a login. You can refuse cookies by turning  them off in your browser. If you have set your browser to warn you before  accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.  Some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by our third-party partners or affiliates is not  covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access to or control  over these cookies.  Further, we and our partners, subsidiaries or  affiliates may use session ID cookies to make it easier for  you to navigate our site(s).</p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</span></strong> Some of our third-party advertising partners employ a software  technology called clear gifs (also called Web Beacons or Web Bugs)  that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what  content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique  identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the  online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored  on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on  web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.   We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to any user's  personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">User Access</span>.</strong> We make a good-faith effort to enable you to update personally  identifiable information you have provided to us and to enable you  to request deletion of any of your information. If you wish to delete  or update any of your personal information please email us at information@allwebleads.com .  Please understand that while we are able to delete or update the information  that we have received from you, this does not necessarily mean that information  about you that has already been shared by us with other Providers may, at the same  time, be updated or deleted by such other Providers. So, in some cases it may be  necessary for you to contact other third parties who may have received your  information and separately request updates to or deletions of your information.  We may decline to process user requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,  require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be  extremely impractical, or where information is required to be retained by us, either by  law or for legitimate business purposes. Further, if you are a marketing affiliate,  you may login to your account at any time to correct, update or delete inaccuracies in your personal information.</p>
<p><strong><span class="bigheading">INFORMATION TRANSFER AND SHARING POLICY</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">Generally</span>. </strong>When you begin to provide personally identifiable information to us,  you do so for the purpose of our sharing this information with Providers  to provide you with the quotes you requested, and this information then becomes  subject to each Provider's own privacy policy (if any). Federal and state laws  provide limitations on the information practices of financial institutions such  as insurance companies. Providers and others to whom we may forward your personally  identifiable information may contact you with a quote by email, telephone, postal mail,  or other forms of communication as permitted by law and you agree to receive such  contacts when you submit your information, regardless of the presence of your phone  number(s) on any local or national no-call or similar no solicitation list. Except  as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information  collected from you on this website with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Please understand that because we are in the business of helping consumers and Providers  identify one another, if you are a consumer and you do not permit us to share your personally  identifiable information with a Provider, we will be unable to assist you and certain of our  services and offerings will be unavailable to you. We expect our Providers to whom we forward  your information to follow applicable laws and abide by the restrictions we impose on their  use of your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong><span class="heading">Other Usage and Offerings</span>.</strong> As our business grows, from time to time we may seek to make available  additional offerings and services including those that may not be insurance-related.  In doing so, we will strive to give our users choices about whether or not you would  like to continue to receive future promotional or marketing communications from us  either directly or on behalf of others whose offerings we think may be of interest to you.  In identifying which offerings we think may be of interest to you, we may use and analyze  information you have provided to us.

Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you  transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission,  we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server  software and firewalls as part of our efforts to protect your information from  unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note  that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed,  altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.

<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and we expect that most such changes will be minor.  When we make changes, we will also revise the "revised date" on the Privacy Policy.  If we should decide to change this Privacy Policy in a manner that we believe would cause us  to use or share your previously provided personally identifiable information in a way that we  think is materially broader or less privacy-friendly from what we have told you here,  we will make reasonable efforts to obtain your consent.  To do this we may notify you on our  homepage or this policy, by email or using other means and technology we think are appropriate  given the changes. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay  informed about how we are protecting the personally identifiable information we collect.
