<span class="bigheading">OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</span>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></span>.
We want to make your experience online satisfying and
safe. This site is owned and operated by All Web
Leads, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively "<span class="term"><strong>Company</strong></span>,"
"<span class="term"><strong>we</strong></span>" or "<span class="term"><strong>us</strong></span>")
headquartered in Austin, Texas. We understand that you value your
privacy. This privacy policy ("<span class="term"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></span>")
governs information that you provide to us and information that we
gather from your use of this website, and it tells you how we may
collect, use, and share this information.
</p>
<p>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, or unless we are given permission by you, 
we will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties.
</p>
<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Why do we collect your information?</strong></span>
We help consumers shop for insurance and various other 
products by connecting consumers with insurance agents or other vendors,
as applicable. By clicking "Get My Quotes" and seeking a quote request, 
you authorize and agree that we may use the information you share with 
us to help match you with insurance providers or other vendors (as 
applicable) through introducing you to insurance agents, insurance 
companies, and/or other vendors, as applicable, who also assist us 
and you in finding insurance agents, insurance companies, discount 
program representatives and/or other requested products or services, 
as applicable (we refer to all of these as "<span class="term"><strong>Providers</strong></span>", 
and we sometimes refer to both consumers and Providers as our "<span class="term"><strong>users</strong></span>") 
to help you obtain free quotes for insurance, discount health plans 
or other products or services, as applicable.  Insurance companies 
establish their rates using a variety of criteria. Since we deal 
with many Providers, the more detailed information you provide to us, 
the more accurate a quote our Providers may help you locate.  
By clicking "Get My Quotes" you also agree to this 
Privacy Policy and consent to your receipt of insurance quote reminders 
and special promotions via email from: name@myinsurancequotefinder.com. If you no longer wish to 
receive promotional emails from us you may opt-out at any time by 
using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email 
communication or contact us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@allwebleads.com">unsubscribe@allwebleads.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Newsletters</strong></span>
If you elect to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and 
email address to send the newsletter to you.  If you no longer wish to receive 
our newsletter, you may opt-out at any time by following the instructions included in each newsletter.
</p>



<span class="bigheading">INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</span>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>What do we collect and how do we use it?</strong></span>

By clicking "Get My Quotes" and requesting an insurance quote, 
you acknowledge and agree that up to eight (8) Providers may contact you 
using your information to provide your requested quote or to obtain 
additional information needed to provide your requested quotes where 
permitted by law. You further acknowledge and agree that each Provider 
that receives your quote request from this website or our affiliates may 
confirm your information through the use of a consumer report, which may 
include your credit score and driving record. You acknowledge that you 
have read and understand the Terms and Conditions of Use of this website 
and agree to be bound by them. We are not responsible, and shall not be 
held liable, if a Provider or other third party to whom we have forwarded 
any of the information you submitted to us violates our Privacy Policy 
or such third party's own privacy policy (if any), or otherwise 
violates the law.
</p>

<p>
Our users may from time-to-time provide us with personally 
identifiable information. Personally identifiable information 
generally means any information that may be used to identify an 
individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, 
telephone number, and email address.
</p>

<p>

Examples of personally identifiable information may include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>First and Last Name</li>
	<li>Postal Address</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
	<li>Phone Number</li>
	<li>Driver's License Number*</li>
	<li>Date of Birth</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>* While not required,
this information may be helpful in processing your request to receive
insurance or other quotations.</em>
</p>
<p>
Certain of our users requesting quotations for health insurance may also be asked to provide certain personal health information, such as:
</p><ul>
	<li>Major Health Conditions</li>
	<li>Prescription Medications you or a family member may be taking</li>
	<li>Whether or not you have been hospitalized in the past 5 years</li>
	<li>Whether or not you have been treated by a doctor for a major health condition in the past year</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We process personally identifiable information as described herein and also for such purposes as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>To deliver our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
	<li>To conduct research and analysis in order to maintain and improve our products and services;</li>
	<li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our system and network;</li>
	<li>To aid us in developing new services;</li>
	<li>To alert you to product updates, special offers, updated information and other new services. (You may opt-out of these communications if you so choose.)</li>
	<li>To contact you in response to your requests for information; and</li>
	<li>To provide you quotes from up to 8 Providers who may contact you using the information you provide or to obtain additional information needed to provide quotes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Further, we may aggregate information we receive from you and from our 
other users and may use or disclose such aggregate information to third 
parties in a manner that does not disclose any individual user's 
personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Affiliate Sign up</strong></span>
If you wish to register as an affiliate we collect your name, company name, 
email address and phone number. We use this information for contacting 
potential affiliates to determine the potential for a business relationship. 
We do not disclose this information to third parties.
</p>



<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CONSUMER REPORT PRACTICES</strong></span><br>
AS STATED ABOVE, BY CLICKING "GET MY QUOTES"
AND SEEKING A QUOTE REQUEST, YOU AUTHORIZE AND AGREE THAT A PROVIDER MAY
OBTAIN ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO PROVIDE YOU WITH
YOUR REQUESTED INSURANCE QUOTE OR POLICY INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
CONSUMER AND/OR CREDIT REPORTS, OR DRIVING RECORDS, MAY BE ORDERED IN
CONNECTION WITH YOUR QUOTE REQUEST. THESE REPORTS MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION THAT MAY ASSIST PROVIDERS IN DETERMINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY
FOR INSURANCE, DISCOUNT HEALTH PLANS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND
RATES THAT YOU MAY BE CHARGED. CONSUMER REPORTS MAY ALSO BE USED FOR
UPDATES, RENEWALS, OR EXTENSIONS OF ANY INSURANCE YOU MAY OBTAIN. A
PROVIDER MAY ALSO OBTAIN AND USE A CREDIT-BASED INSURANCE SCORE
CONTAINED IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT. THIS INFORMATION MAY BE COMBINED BY A
PROVIDER WITH INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US, AND BY CLICKING SUBMIT AND
SEEKING A QUOTE REQUEST, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING YOUR
WRITTEN PERMISSION TO OUR PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN YOUR CREDIT REPORT.
</p>

<span class="bigheading">USAGE TRACKING</span>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Usage Data Generally</strong></span>.
Like many internet companies, we track website and service usage data to 
improve the services we offer and the security of your interaction with 
the site. We collect user traffic patterns throughout our website. This 
information is collected to help improve website flow and usability. In 
addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to 
our website from the reports and emails we send to our users. This is 
done to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to 
discourage fraudulent use and to improve the security of our site and 
your interaction with the site.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Cookies</strong></span>.
We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The 
cookie will enable us to relate your use of this website to information 
that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personally 
identifiable information a cookie can contain is information that you 
yourself supply. We do not store personally identifiable information in cookies.  
A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created 
by other websites that are not owned by us. We may use cookies to track 
user traffic patterns (as described above). In addition, we may use encrypted 
cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs onto any 
portion of our website requiring a login. You can refuse cookies by turning 
them off in your browser. If you have set your browser to warn you before 
accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. 
Some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
</p>
<p>
The use of cookies by our third-party partners or affiliates is not 
covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access to or control 
over these cookies.  Further, we and our partners, subsidiaries or 
affiliates may use session ID cookies to make it easier for 
you to navigate our site(s).
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></span>
Some of our third-party advertising partners employ a software 
technology called clear gifs (also called Web Beacons or Web Bugs) 
that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what 
content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique 
identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the 
online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored 
on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on 
web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to any user's 
personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>User Access</strong></span>.
We make a good-faith effort to enable you to update personally 
identifiable information you have provided to us and to enable you 
to request deletion of any of your information. If you wish to delete 
or update any of your personal information please email us at information@allwebleads.com . 
Please understand that while we are able to delete or update the information 
that we have received from you, this does not necessarily mean that information 
about you that has already been shared by us with other Providers may, at the same 
time, be updated or deleted by such other Providers. So, in some cases it may be 
necessary for you to contact other third parties who may have received your 
information and separately request updates to or deletions of your information. 
We may decline to process user requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, 
require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be 
extremely impractical, or where information is required to be retained by us, either by 
law or for legitimate business purposes. Further, if you are a marketing affiliate, 
you may login to your account at any time to correct, update or delete inaccuracies in your personal information.
</p>


<span class="bigheading">INFORMATION TRANSFER AND SHARING POLICY</span>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Generally</strong></span>.
When you begin to provide personally identifiable information to us, 
you do so for the purpose of our sharing this information with Providers 
to provide you with the quotes you requested, and this information then becomes 
subject to each Provider's own privacy policy (if any). Federal and state laws 
provide limitations on the information practices of financial institutions such 
as insurance companies. Providers and others to whom we may forward your personally 
identifiable information may contact you with a quote by email, telephone, postal mail, 
or other forms of communication as permitted by law and you agree to receive such 
contacts when you submit your information, regardless of the presence of your phone 
number(s) on any local or national no-call or similar no solicitation list. Except 
as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information 
collected from you on this website with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. 
Please understand that because we are in the business of helping consumers and Providers 
identify one another, if you are a consumer and you do not permit us to share your personally 
identifiable information with a Provider, we will be unable to assist you and certain of our 
services and offerings will be unavailable to you. We expect our Providers to whom we forward 
your information to follow applicable laws and abide by the restrictions we impose on their 
use of your personally identifiable information.
</p>


<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Other Usage and Offerings</strong></span>.
As our business grows, from time to time we may seek to make available 
additional offerings and services including those that may not be insurance-related. 
In doing so, we will strive to give our users choices about whether or not you would 
like to continue to receive future promotional or marketing communications from us 
either directly or on behalf of others whose offerings we think may be of interest to you. 
In identifying which offerings we think may be of interest to you, we may use and analyze 
information you have provided to us. If you choose not to receive such marketing 
communications, you may still receive certain relationship or transactional communications 
from us as described herein. We do not plan to sell, rent or transfer your personally 
identifiable information for non-insurance related purposes to any third parties unless 
or except in connection with the merger, sale or reorganization of our business 
as set forth elsewhere in this policy.
</p>


<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Vendors and Suppliers</strong></span>.
We may provide personally identifiable information to or permit access 
to personally identifiable information by our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, 
vendors and service providers for the purpose of verifying data or where such 
access is incidental to their assisting us such as phone number verification 
services and email service providers. We expect that these parties will only 
process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with 
this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Protecting Our Legal Rights and Other's Rights</strong></span>.
We do not otherwise share personally identifiable information about website 
users with third parties unless we believe using or sharing such information is 
appropriate to carry out a user's request or if we have a good-faith belief that 
access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably 
necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or 
enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our <a href="terms.php">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>, 
including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent 
or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect 
against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of the Company, 
its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as 
required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our 
rights and/or comply with a legal or judicial proceeding or court order.  
</p>


<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Merger or Sale of Company</strong></span>.
If we should ever file for bankruptcy or have our assets sold 
to or merged with another entity, information that we receive from you 
through this website may be treated as an asset of the Company and may 
be transferred to the fullest extent permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
<span class="heading"><strong>Promotions and Programs</strong></span>.
From time to time, you may be given the opportunity to 
participate in sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, or other promotions 
and programs offered by us, either alone or with promotional partners. 
Participation in these promotions or programs may require you to submit 
additional information about yourself, including personally identifiable 
information. Our use and sharing of your information, including personally 
identifiable information, collected through a promotion or program will be 
governed by the official rules or agreement governing that promotion or program, 
as well as by this Privacy Policy. The terms of those rules or that agreement 
will supersede any conflicting provisions of this Privacy Policy.

</p>

<span class="bigheading">MARKETING AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS</span>

<p>
When you submit information to us, you agree to receive email, fax, and 
other forms of communications from us and those to whom you have authorized 
us to forward your personally identifiable information. If you would like to 
opt-out of receiving promotional or marketing material from us in the future,  
please click the following link: <a href="http://AllWebLeads.awlusc.com/dab4ad6f24c51694c2d892f5d8608944">UNSUBSCRIBE</a>: 
or by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each promotional or marketing email communication.  
Your decision to opt-out shall not preclude us from communicating with you regarding your existing or 
past relationship with us and shall not preclude us, including our employees, contractors and other 
representatives, from accessing and using the information you have provided in a manner 
that is not personally identifying (such as in aggregate or anonymous form). 
If you do not wish to receive further communications from any person or entity (such as a Provider) 
to whom we have forwarded your information with your permission, you must contact them directly.
</p>


<span class="bigheading">AFFILIATED WEBSITES, OTHER WEBSITES, AND ADVERTISEMENTS</span>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to websites and services that are owned and operated by 
All Web Leads, Inc. We do not exercise control over the websites of third parties

for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable 
privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or

</p>

<span class="bigheading">CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS/REVIEWS</span>

<span class="bigheading">AUTHORIZED USERS</span>

This website is hosted in the United States and is intended exclusively for

</p>

<span class="bigheading">SECURITY</span>
<p>
No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you 
transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, 
we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server 
software and firewalls as part of our efforts to protect your information from 
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note 
that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, 
altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. 
By using our site, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
</p>

<p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter 
sensitive information (such as social security number, Driver's license number, 
national ID, personal health information) on our registration forms, we encrypt that 
information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically 
so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this website or providing 
personally identifiable information to us you agree that we can communicate with you 
electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your

<span class="bigheading">CHANGES AND UPDATES</span>
<p>
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and we expect that most such changes will be minor. 
When we make changes, we will also revise the "revised date" on the Privacy Policy. 
If we should decide to change this Privacy Policy in a manner that we believe would cause us 
to use or share your previously provided personally identifiable information in a way that we 
think is materially broader or less privacy-friendly from what we have told you here, 
we will make reasonable efforts to obtain your consent.  To do this we may notify you on our 
homepage or this policy, by email or using other means and technology we think are appropriate 
given the changes. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay 
informed about how we are protecting the personally identifiable information we collect. 
Your submission of a quote request and/or other use of this website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
