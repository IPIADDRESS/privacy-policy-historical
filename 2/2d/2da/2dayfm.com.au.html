              This Privacy Policy applies to the collection of Personal Information 
              by or on behalf of Austereo Pty Ltd, Consolidated Broadcasting System 
              (WA) Pty Ltd, Perth FM Radio Pty Ltd and all other members of the 
              Austereo Pty Ltd group of companies (“Austereo”).
            <p>On some occasions we may conduct a promotion or other activity 
              which has its own specific Privacy Policy. In this case, notice 
              of that policy will be provided at the time any Personal Information 
              is sought and that policy will apply to that promotion or activity 
              and will override this policy to the extent of any inconsistency.</p>
            <p>INTRODUCTION<br>
              Austereo operates a number of broadcast radio stations throughout 
              Australia. Through our varied operations, we gather information 
              for a variety of reasons, for example to enable us to improve the 
              nature of the services we provide and to facilitate the running 
              of various competitions.</p>
            <p>We collect personal information from you in various ways, for example, 
              when you enter competitions, advertise with us, supply goods or 
              services to us or send us your comments or other correspondence. 
              For the purposes of this Privacy Policy all parties we deal with 
              are referred to as “Individuals”. The personal information 
              we collect from you may include your contact details, buying habits, 
              opinions, product preferences, transactional details or other information 
              which may lead you to be identified (herein referred to as “PI”).</p>
            <p>We are committed to the protection of PI in a manner which is fair 
              and unobtrusive. We meet the standards set out in the Privacy Act 
              1988 (Commonwealth) (“the Act”) and the National Privacy 
              Principles (“NPPs”) regarding the way in which we will 
              collect, hold, use and disclose PI and respond to your requests 
              to access and/or correct it. This policy sets out how we handle 
              your PI and the rights and obligations that we both have in relation 
              to that information.</p>
            <p>This policy may be reviewed from time to time so it is best to 
              read it at any time you are proposing to supply us with PI. By using 
              our website or providing PI, you agree to be bound by the terms 
              of this Privacy Policy and consent to any use of PI that is in accordance 
              with this policy. Any proposed use of PI that is not covered by 
              this policy will be disclosed at or prior to the time of collection 
              and where practicable, your consent will be obtained.</p>
            <p>ANONYMITY<br>
              In accordance with the NPPs, you may deal with us on an anonymous 
              basis where practical. However, as a provider of a wide range of 
              services, we find that it is often necessary to collect PI from 
              you during the course of transactions, for example, to facilitate 
              the running of a competition.</p>
            <p>CONSENT<br>
              Wherever practical, we will obtain your express consent when collecting 
              PI. In some situations, we will interpret your actions as indicating 
              your consent to the collection of PI. For example, this may occur 
              when you have provided PI for a particular purpose and that purpose 
              cannot be achieved without using your PI.</p>
            <p>WHY WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
              We collect PI for a number of reasons, including:</p>
            <p>• to provide you with our products or services; <br>
              • to administer our relationship with you; <br>
              • to facilitate the running of trade promotions and other 
              competitions (see below); <br>
              • to facilitate the running of listener loyalty programs such 
              as the Freq Club;<br>
              • to monitor activity on our websites, for the purpose of 
              maintaining the security of those websites;<br>
              • to compile Individual and listener databases to enable us 
              to market goods and services more accurately;<br>
              • to provide advertisers with information to assist them in 
              their decision making processes and marketing of goods and services; 
              <br>
              • for internal administrative purposes, such as procedural 
              assessments, risk management, staff training, accounting, billing 
              and product and service reviews; and <br>
              • to identify and inform you about other products or services 
              that may be of interest to you.</p>
            <p>If our relationship with you is not solely one of broadcaster-listener, 
              we may use your information in other ways, for example, to assess 
              goods or services that you supply or to pay your account.</p>
            <p>COMPETITIONS<br>
              If you provide us with PI as part of an entry into a competition 
              then we will use that information to contact you in connection with 
              the competition and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
            <p>Depending on the nature of the competition or offer, we will ask 
              for your personal details such as your name, address, email address, 
              age, telephone number/s and/or gender. Sometimes in relation to 
              a particular competition we may also seek additional information.</p>
            <p>PI collected during competitions will be governed by the terms 
              set out in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise stated in the conditions 
              of entry for the competition, or an alternate Privacy Policy applies.</p>
            <p>CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING ALL REQUIRED INFORMATION<br>
              We may not be able to provide a complete service to you if PI is 
              not provided upon request. For example, providing incomplete information 
              could render a competition entry invalid.</p>
            <p>HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
              We primarily collect PI directly from you through written and/or 
              verbal means of communication. However, PI may be collected in a 
              variety of ways, including:</p>
            <p>• competition entry forms;<br>
              • application forms;<br>
              • participation in the Freq Club or other listener loyalty 
              programs;<br>
              • email;<br>
              • posted mail;<br>
              • websites (including in some instances cookies);<br>
              • online transactions;<br>
              • networking functions (eg business cards);<br>
              • in person;<br>
              • over the telephone;<br>
              • credit card details via credit card purchases;<br>
              • public surveys;<br>
              • employee applications and surveys;<br>
              • business contacts (eg contractual documents);<br>
              • information collected from third parties (eg marketing databases);<br>
              • information collected from public sources (eg telephone 
              directories); and<br>
              • other forms of written and verbal communication.</p>
            <p>We may also obtain details about you or your business from sources 
              that are publicly available such as websites, journals, legal directories 
              and phone books. We will only collect information about you from 
              third parties in rare circumstances, for example where one of your 
              friends indicates to us that one of our services or products may 
              be of interest to you. If we do collect PI in this manner, it will 
              only comprise of your name and contact details and we will endeavor 
              to make you aware of the collection of this information, the third 
              party’s contact details and this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We may also collect anonymous information through the use of cookies 
              on our website. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored 
              on your computer’s hard disk. Most web-browsers are set to 
              accept cookies but you can set your web-browser to refuse cookies. 
              Cookies themselves do not identify users personally but they do 
              allow the tracking of an Individual’s use of a website. Cookies 
              have become commonplace.</p>
            <p>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE HOLD ABOUT YOU<br>
              We only hold information about you that is relevant to our relationship 
              with you. Generally, the PI we hold will include (where relevant) 
              your name, contact details, membership/card/account number/s, records 
              of correspondence, subscription and payment details, type of business 
              and billing statements.</p>
            <p>If our relationship with you is not solely one of broadcaster-listener, 
              we may collect other information that we consider necessary in the 
              circumstances, such as the nature of the products or services that 
              you supply, quotes that you provide, your credit details and, if 
              you are a non-profit organisation that we have agreed to assist, 
              how you make use of the products or services that we provide you.

              Sensitive information includes information about your race or ethnic 
              origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, 
              trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual 
              activity or orientation. We rarely ask for sensitive information, 
              but may do so occasionally as part of competition, promotion or 
              survey, for example. We will not ask for sensitive information unless:</p>
            <p>• you have consented;<br>
              • the collection of the information is specifically authorised 
              by law;<br>
              • the collection is necessary to lessen a serious or imminent 
              threat to the health or safety or any person; or<br>
              • the collection of the information is necessary for the establishment, 
              exercise or defence of a legal claim.</p>
            <p>HOW WE HOLD YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
              Depending on the circumstances, we may hold PI in hardcopy or electronic 
              form, or both. Generally, we keep hardcopies of all correspondence 
              that we enter into and maintain details about Individuals that we 
              interact with in our electronic database/s. </p>
            <p>HOW WE SECURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
              We hold all hardcopy and electronic records of PI in a secure manner 
              to ensure that it is protected from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, 
              modification or disclosure. PI held in hardcopy form is, wherever 
              practical, kept under lock and key. Pl held in electronic form is, 
              wherever practical, password protected and/or encrypted.</p>
            <p>Our staff follows strict information handling procedures and only 
              those whose tasks require use of your information are able to access 
              it.</p>
            <p>We regularly de-identify and/or destroy PI in a secure manner, 
              for example by using shredding machines and/or secure disposal units, 
              once it is no longer needed or required to be kept by law. <br>
              Where possible and practical, we endeavour to comply with recognised 
              Australian and international standards relating to information security.</p>
            <p>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
              We will only disclose your PI in certain, limited circumstances.</p>
            <p>In general, only our officers, employees or contractors who require 
              the information in order to perform their functions may access PI. 
            </p>
            <p>We will only disclose PI to parties other than our officers, employees 
              and contractors where:</p>
            <p>• that disclosure is required to give effect to the purpose/s 
              for which we collected the PI, for example, to provide you with 
              a service you have requested, and we believe that you would reasonably 
              expect us to use the information; or<br>
              • you have consented to that disclosure; or<br>
              • we believe that the disclosure may lessen a risk of harm 
              to the health or safety of any person; or<br>
              • we believe that the disclosure is required to protect our 
              rights or property or any other user of our services; or<br>
              • we believe an unlawful activity is being undertaken and 
              the PI is disclosed as part of our investigation into or reporting 
              of suspected unlawful activity; or<br>
              • we are required by law to disclose the PI; or <br>
              • the disclosure is required for the investigation of a possible 
              breach or enforcement of a criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary 
              penalty, or for the protection of public revenue. </p>
            <p>Generally, disclosure of PI will only be made for a purpose that 
              is directly related to the product or service that we are providing 
              you. This may include disclosure to organisations that provide us 
              with professional advice, such as solicitors and accountants, and 
              to contractors to whom we outsource functions, such as mailing houses, 
              collators, electronic network administrators or debt collection 
              agencies. However, where possible, we take contractual measures 
              and, in all other circumstances, all reasonable measures with our 
              contractors to ensure that they comply with the standards set out 
              in the Act and the NPPs. Where practicable and appropriate, we require 
              our contractors to perform their work in-house and do not permit 
              them to disclose PI that we have disclosed to them to their sub-contractors 
              (if any).<br>
              The only other circumstances in which disclosure of PI may occur 
              are those which are expressly permitted under the Act. For example, 
              where the disclosure takes place with your consent or where we are 
              legally required to disclose the information, such as under a court 
              order or Australian taxation laws.<br>
              Overseas Transfers of Information<br>
              We will only transfer your Personal Information overseas if the 
              transfer is to yourself, to one of your authorised representatives, 
              or with your express consent.</p>
            <p>If obtaining your consent is not practical, then the information 
              may still be transferred if, as part of the agreement for the transfer 
              of that information, the other organisation agrees to comply with 
              the privacy obligation we owe to you. </p>
            <p>PI may be transferred to our majority shareholder Village Roadshow, 
              for the purpose of providing you with information regarding upcoming 
              offers and opportunities offered by Village Roadshow.</p>
            <p>PI may be transferred to Fairwest Direct Inc (“Fairwest”) 
              and Level 3 Communications Inc (“Level 3”) in the United 
              States of America in order to facilitate the listener loyalty program 
              known as the Freq Club. By participating in the Freq Club, you consent 
              to the transfer of your PI overseas. Fairwest and Level 3 do not 
              have permission to use, sell, transfer or access PI in any way except 
              in connection with facilitating the Freq Club. Our agreement in 
              relation to the Freq Club requires that all third parties adhere 
              to the NPPs in every respect.</p>
            <p>We will not send your information outside of Australia in any other 
              circumstances, unless we have your consent.</p>
            <p>Aggregated Information<br>
              The demographic make-up of our database is researched on an aggregated 
              basis to see how successfully we are reaching our target audience 
              and providing services and items of interest to them.</p>
            <p>We will not sell your name or contact details to a third party 
              without your permission, but we may provide advertisers with general 
              information concerning, for example, the demographic make-up of 
              our listener base and/or traffic to our website. This information 
              does not enable you to be identified as it is aggregated.</p>
            <p>OTHER SITES<br>
              Please note that our website contains links to other websites which 
              are not administered by us. If you click on a link to another website 
              and subsequently leave our website, our Privacy Policy will no longer 
              apply, and we suggest that you refer to the privacy policy relating 
              to the other website. </p>
            <p>ADVERTISEMENTS<br>
              Advertisers or sponsors on our websites may collect information 
              when you view or click on their advertisements. We do not have any 
              control over this data collection.</p>
            <p>YOUR RIGHT OF ACCESS<br>
              You may request access to your PI at any time by written request 
              to Austereo’s Privacy Officer by mail at GPO Box 107.1 Adelaide 
              South Australia 5000, or by email to privacy@austereo.com.au.</p>
            <p>We may impose a reasonable charge for providing access to Personal 
              Information in accordance with the Act.</p>
            <p>When we may withhold access to PI<br>
              Access to PI may be withheld in several circumstances, including 
              where:</p>
            <p>• providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat 
              to the life or health of any person;<br>
              • providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the 
              privacy of others;<br>
              • the information is subject to confidentiality where the 
              person who provided the information to us did so expressly on the 
              condition that it remain confidential;<br>
              • the request is vexatious or frivolous;<br>
              • the information relates to current or anticipated legal 
              proceedings between Austereo and the person and the information 
              would not be required to be discovered to a court;<br>
              • we are in commercial negotiations with the person and the 
              information would reveal our intentions or otherwise prejudice those 
              negotiations;<br>
              • providing access would reveal information relating to our 
              commercially sensitive decision making processes;<br>
              • providing access would be unlawful or we are required by 
              law to withhold access; or<br>
              • providing access could prejudice the investigation, detection 
              or prosecution by Austereo or by a government body of possible unlawful 
              activity or serious or improper misconduct, or is likely to cause 
              damage to the security of Australia.<br>
              Where we are unable to provide you with access to PI, we will provide 
              written reasons and may instead, at our discretion, choose to give 
              you a summary of that information. We may also consider, at our 
              discretion, whether the provision of access to an independent third 
              party will meet both of our requirements. </p>
            <p>YOU MAY CORRECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
              We regularly monitor the quality and accuracy of PI that we maintain 
              and, where practicable, update that information. In addition, you 
              may request that your PI be updated at any time. </p>
            <p>If your PI is out-of-date or otherwise incorrect, please contact 
              Austereo’s Privacy Officer with your written advice regarding 
              the inaccuracy of the information and we will endeavour to correct 
              it for you wherever possible. </p>
            <p>In the unlikely event that we disagree about the accuracy of the 
              information such that we are unable to change it, you may provide 
              us with a statement that you dispute its accuracy and we will associate 
              the statement with your information in such a manner that it will 
              be brought to the attention of each person who uses that information. 
            </p>
            <p>YOUR RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT<br>
              If you are not satisfied with the manner in which we have handled 
              your PI, you may lodge a complaint in writing with Austereo’s 
              Privacy Officer. We will inform you as to who will handle your complaint.</p>
            <p>PROMOTIONAL INFORMATION<br>
              We would like to send you promotional information about goods and 
              services that we believe may be of interest to you. However, we 
              understand that you may not wish to receive such material. You will 
              have an opportunity to “opt in” and/or “opt out” 
              (as applicable) in connection with promotions except in some cases 
              where you would be notified that opting in was a condition of participation. 
              If this is the case, please inform our Privacy Officer and we will 
              promptly remove your name from our mailing list. </p>
            <p>DIRECT MARKETING<br>
              PI collected for direct marketing purposes will only be collected, 
              used or disclosed with your consent as provided for in this Privacy 
              Policy. </p>
            <p>In circumstances where we cannot practicably obtain your consent, 
              we may still engage in direct marketing to you, but will:</p>
            <p>(a) advise you that you can be taken off the mailing list at any 
              time following receipt of a request from you to that effect; and</p>
            <p>(b) display our contact details clearly in each direct marketing 
              publication.</p>
            <p>You may be removed from any Austereo mailing list at any time. 
              Simply send a written request to Austereo’s Privacy Officer.</p>
            <p>WE MAY NEED TO CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME<br>
              Due to changing business circumstances and legal requirements, we 
              may need to amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, 
              we will publish the revised policy on our website/s. Any action 
              that was undertaken prior to the policy change will continue to 
              be regulated by the policy as it existed at the time the action 
              was taken. </p>
            <p>FURTHER INFORMATION<br>
              Further information about privacy may be obtained from the Office 
              of the Federal Privacy Commissioner of Australia at: http://www.privacy.gov.au.</p>
