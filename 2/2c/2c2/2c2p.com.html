We also         collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access         your 2C2P account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized         transactions.     </p>     <p>         <u>Information About You From Third Parties</u></p>     <p>         In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify with third         parties the information you provide.</p>     <p>         <u>Additional Verification</u></p>     <p>         If we cannot verify the information that you provide, we will ask you to send us         additional information by fax (such as your Citizen ID, credit card statement, and/or         a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address),         or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.     </p>     <p>         <u>Web Site Traffic Information</u></p>     <p>         Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive         at or leave the 2C2P Web site, we automatically receive the Web address of the         site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages         of our Web site you visit while you are on the 2C2P site, the type of browser         you use and the times you access our Web site. We use this information only to try         to understand our customers’ preferences better and to manage the load on our servers,         so as to improve our service and your experience with 2C2P. We do not track the         Web sites that you visit before or after you leave the 2C2P site.     </p>     <p>         <u>Our Use of ‘Cookies’</u></p>     <p>         ‘Cookies’ are small files of data that we send to your computer to allow us to recognize         you as a 2C2P customer if you return to the 2C2P site using the same computer         and browser. We send a ‘session cookie’ to your computer if and when you log in         to your 2C2P account by entering your e-mail address and Password. These cookies         allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same         session, so that you don’t need to re-enter your Password multiple times. Once you         log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any         effect.     </p>     <p>         We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in         form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time when you log         in to your 2C2P account. In addition, we use cookies to process our referral         program, described in Section C below. Our cookie files are encoded so that your         e-mail address and other information can only be interpreted by 2C2P. We may,         however, share cookie information regarding whether or not a certain user is already         registered with 2C2P with certain merchants with whom we have an official co-marketing         relationship.     </p>     <p>         <u>Customer Service Correspondence</u></p>     <p>         If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we retain such information         in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence         and other correspondence from 2C2P to you. We retain these records in order to         measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and         violations of our User Agreement. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted         by law.     </p>     <p>         <u>Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data</u></p>     <p>         From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for         such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests         and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the         survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users         in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information         will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.     </p>     <p>         <u>Non-member Recipients and Requests</u></p>     <p>         When a member either sends a payment to, or requests a payment from, an individual         who is not a registered member of 2C2P, we will retain the information that the         member submits to us, including, for example, the other party's email address and/or         name, for the benefit of the member who is attempting to contact the non-member,         so that the member can see a complete record of his or her transactions, including         uncompleted transactions. Although this information is stored indefinitely, we will         not market to the non-member in any way at any time. Additionally, these non-members         have the same rights to access and correct information about themselves (assuming         that their email addresses were correct enough to reach them) as anyone else who         uses 2C2P.</p>     <p>    <a name="03"><b>C.

However, your credit card number, bank account and other financial information         will NEVER be revealed to anyone whom you have paid or who has paid you through         2C2P, except if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal         process.     </p>     <p>         <u>Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than 2C2P Customers</u></p>     <p>         2C2P will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to         third parties. 2C2P will not share any of your personally identifiable information         with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with         your express permission (and to other 2C2P customers as described above).

We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of a 2C2P account,         to send you notice of payments that you send or receive through 2C2P (including         referral payments described below), to send information about important changes         to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required         by law.

Information Security </b></a>       </p>     <p>         2C2P is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of         information security. Your credit card and bank account information are stored only         in encrypted form on computers that are not connected to the Internet. We restrict         access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know         that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical,         electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard         your nonpublic personal information. We test our security systems regularly and         also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes.         For more information on 2C2P’s security practices, please visit the 2C2P Security         Center.     </p>     <p>         The security of your 2C2P account also relies on your protection of your 2C2P         Password. We strongly urge that you never share your 2C2P Password with anyone.         2C2P representatives will never ask you for your Password, so any e-mail or other         communication requesting your Password should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious.         If you do share your 2C2P Password with a third party for any reason, including         because the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as         account aggregation, the third party will have access to your account and your personal         information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your Password. If         you believe someone else has obtained access to your Password, please change it         immediately by logging in to your account at https://www.2C2P.com/ and changing         your Profile settings, and also contact us right away as described in Section F         below.     </p>     <p>         <a name="05"><b>E.

If you close         your 2C2P account, we will mark your account in our database as ‘Closed,’ but         will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to         deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to         avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account.
