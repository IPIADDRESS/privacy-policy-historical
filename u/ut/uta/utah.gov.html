              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </center>
            <p><span class="blk">Purpose</span><br>
              The State of Utah (State) is committed to protecting the privacy 
              of those accessing its websites. The purpose of this policy is to 
              inform those accessing State websites about the collection and use 
              of the personally identifiable information of its users.</p>
            <p><span class="blk">Scope</span><br>
              This privacy policy statement applies to all State executive branch 
              agency websites except those administered by the State Board of 
              Education, the Board of Regents, institutions of higher education, 
              and except as described below in the section called "State 
              Agency Privacy Policies and How They Relate to This Policy."</p>
            <p><span class="blk"><a href="hb25.html">HB25 Governmental Internet Information Privacy Act Description</a></span></p>
            <p><span class="blk"><a name="pii"></a>Definition of Personally identifiable Information</span><br>
              For the purposes of this policy "personally identifiable information" means any information collected online that could serve to identify 
              an individual, such as: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> First and last name</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Physical address</li>
              <li>E-mail address</li>
              <li>Telephone number</li>
              <li>Social Security number</li>
              <li>Credit card information</li>
              <li>Account Number </li>
              <li>Bank account information</li>
              <li>Any combination of personal information that could be used to 
                determine identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blk">Collection  of Information</p>
            <p>The following information may be automatically collected and retained 
              if you look or search through our web pages, or download information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> The Internet domain and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the 
                computer you are using to access our site; </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>The type of browser and operating system used to visit our site;</li>
              <li>The date and time of when you access our site; and </li>
              <li>Which portions of the website you visit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data collected serve as part of our statistical analysis about 
              the use of our websites so we may better design online services 
              and improve access to them. We do not attempt to gain personally 
              identifiable information about individual users and associate it 
              with IP addresses. The State does not use the information automatically 
              collected to ascertain your personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>Except where specified, you do not have to provide personally identifiable 
              information to visit or download information from State websites. 
              Unless you choose to make your personally identifiable information 
              available to us, the State does not collect such information from 
              you. 


The State does not use or place <a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm?term=spyware">Spyware</a> on your computer.

Be aware that government agencies may request personally identifiable 
              information from you in order to perform requested specialized services.            </p>
            <p><strong><span class="blk"><a name="pii_used" id="pii_used"></a></span>How <span class="blk">Personally Identifiable Information</span> is used by the governmental entity </strong><br>E-mail or other information requests sent to a State website may 
                be saved and used to respond to the request, forward the request 
                to the appropriate agency, communicate updates to the State site 
                that may be of interest to citizens, or provide the State web designer 
                with valuable customer feedback to assist in improving the website.</p>
            <p>Any personally identifiable information an individual provides 
              to a State site will be used solely by the State of Utah, its entities, 
              and third party agents with whom it has contracted to perform a 
              state function on its behalf, unless the information is designated 
              as public record by an individual State agency as authorized under 
              Title 63, Chapter 2, <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01016.htm">302</a>,

              of the Utah Code , entitled "Government Records Access and 
              Management Act" (GRAMA), and the State agency's website provides 
              conspicuous notice that such information is subject to public access.</p>

              Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
              Except as otherwise permitted by law, the State does not knowingly

              Information collected is subject to the access  
              provisions of 


GRAMA and other applicable sections of the Utah Code,  federal regulations, and federal law. Consequently, certain communications may be subject to public disclosure. However, in these instances you will be notified on either the utah.gov portal or on the agency website under the conditions described below in "State Agency Privacy Policies and How They Relate to This Policy."</p>
            <p>All records that are prepared, owned, received, or retained by 
              a governmental entity that may be reproduced by certain means are 
              considered public, unless they are private, controlled or protected 
              as outlined in Sections <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01016.htm">63-2-302</a>, <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01017.htm">63-2-303</a>, and <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01018.htm">63-2-304</a> of the 
              Utah Code, or are records to which access is restricted according 
              to court rule, other State law, federal law, or federal regulation. 
              Information that is generally considered public record under GRAMA 
              - and not made confidential elsewhere in the Utah Code or by federal 
              law - may be subject to electronic access through Utah.gov websites.</p>
            <p>PII is used by the governmental entities for the purpose of conducting official state business. A governmental entity may share PII with another governmental entity if it is designated as a record that is private, controlled, or protected as described in Section <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01014.htm">63-2-206</a> unless such data sharing is expressly prohibited, authorized or required by federal law, state law, or federal regulation. In some instances a Governor’s directive or executive order may limit or prohibit data sharing even though Section <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01014.htm">63-2-206</a> may permit such data sharing.</p>
            <p><span class="blk"><a name="dsq"></a>Data Security and Quality</span><br>
              The State of Utah is committed to data security and the data integrity 
              of personally identifiable information available from or collected 
              by State government websites. The State has taken precautions to 
              protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or 
              alteration. Any authorized third parties responsible for this information 
              are committed to the same principles, and are required by contract 
              to follow the same policies and guidelines as the State of Utah 
              in protecting this information. Visitors should be aware, however, 
              that even though protections are in place, the State cannot guarantee 
              against the occurrence of hardware failure, unauthorized intrusion 
              or other technical problems. </p>
            <p><strong><span class="blk"><a name="pii_correct" id="pii_correct"></a></span> Procedures for access by the user to view or correct personally identifiable information</strong><br>
              Unless otherwise prohibited by State law, federal law, or federal 
              regulation, an individual may access and correct personally identifiable 
              information whether or not the inaccuracy was created by accident, 
              unauthorized access, or a change in circumstances. The State also 
              reserves the right to use any legally appropriate measures to prevent, 
              monitor, and investigate any attempt to deface, delete or otherwise 
              tamper with or abuse a State website, server, database, information 
              system or other State technology asset.

            <p><span class="blk">State Agency Privacy Policies and How They Relate 
              to This Policy</span><br>
              A privacy policy issued by a State agency for its website may provide 
              additional detail to, but not conflict with, this privacy policy, 
              except as required by an applicable State law, federal law, or federal 
              regulation. Any State agency or organization who collects or uses 
              personally identifiable information in a manner inconsistent with 
              this policy as a result of an applicable State law, federal law, 
              or federal regulation, will adopt and issue a privacy policy of 
              its own. The privacy policy it issues shall describe how its collection 
              and use of personally identifiable information differs from the 
              State's practices as set forth in this policy. The agency's privacy 
              policy will be conspicuously posted for your review. The privacy 
              policy issued by the agency or organization will apply to its own 
              website.


In addition to this policy, we also recommend that you refer to the applicable agency privacy policy to obtain a description about how your personal information is collected and used or contact or <a href="../contact.html">Live Help</a>.<br>
              <br>
              An agency may not substitute its own privacy policy for this policy, 
              unless a state law, federal regulation or federal statute requires 
              an agency to treat personally identifiable information in a way 
              that is inconsistent with this policy. In this case, an agency may 
              opt-out of the specific provision of this policy which conflicts 
              with the state statute, federal regulation or federal statute. If 
              that occurs, the remainder of the provisions of this policy shall 
              apply to the agency.</p>
            <p>A full description of how agencies are to inform you if your personal 
              information is treated any differently than as described in this 
              policy is provided in <a href="http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/code/r365/r365-005.htm">R365-5-1 
              et seq</a>. of the Utah Administrative Code, which governs the actions of state agencies.            </p>
            <p><span class="blk">Non-State Websites</span><br>
              Visitors may link to various websites from State web pages. The 
              State is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of 
              external sites. Many of these sites, particularly those in the private 
              sector, may not be subject to GRAMA, other sections of the Utah 
              Code, or federal law. Those visiting external sites are advised 
              to check the applicable privacy statement and be cautious about 
              providing personally identifiable information without a clear understanding 
              of how the information will be used.</p>
            <p><span class="blk">Changes to and Versions of the Privacy Policy</span><br>
              This privacy policy may be changed at any time; any changes will 
              be posted on this web page. The version number and date the policy 
              was last revised will be noted on the policy. Information collected 
              while a particular version of this policy is in effect will be handled 
              in accordance with that version. If you have questions, comments,
