          <span class="bold">Privacy Policy Statement for State of Utah Websites<br>
          Version 2.08<br>
          October 19, 2001 </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p></center>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Purpose</span><br>
        The State of Utah (State) is committed to protecting the privacy of those 
        accessing its websites. The purpose of this policy is to inform those 
        accessing State websites about the collection and use of the personally 
        identifiable information of its users.</p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Scope</span><br>
        This privacy policy statement applies to all State executive branch agency 
        websites except those administered by the State Board of Education, the 
        Board of Regents, institutions of higher education, and except as described 
        below in the section called "State Agency Privacy Policies and How 
        They Relate to This Policy."</p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Definition of Personally identifiable 
        Information</span><br>
        For the purposes of this policy "personally identifiable information" 
        means any information collected online that could serve to identify an 
        individual, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> First and last name</li>
        <li class="text">Physical address</li>
        <li class="text">E-mail address</li>
        <li class="text">Telephone number</li>
        <li class="text">Social Security number</li>
        <li class="text">Credit card information</li>
        <li class="text">Bank account information</li>
        <li class="text">Any combination of personal information that could be 
          used to determine identity</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text"><b>Collection and Use of Information - In General</b></p>
      <p class="text"><u>Information automatically collected:</u></p>
      <p class="text">The following information may be automatically collected 
        and retained if you look or search through our web pages, or download 
        information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text">The Internet domain and Internet Protocol (IP) address 
          of the computer you are using to access our site; </li>
        <li class="text">The type of browser and operating system used to visit 
          our site;</li>
        <li class="text">The date and time of when you access our site; and </li>
        <li class="text">Which portions of the website you visit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">The data collected serve as part of our statistical analysis 
        about the use of our websites so we may better design online services 
        and improve access to them. We do not attempt to gain personally identifiable 
        information about individual users and associate it with IP addresses. 
        The State does not use the information automatically collected to ascertain 
        your personally identifiable information. </p>
      <p class="text"><u>Personally identifiable information provided by you:</u></p>
      <p class="text">Except where specified, you do not have to provide personally 
        identifiable information to visit or download information from State websites. 
        Unless you choose to make your personally identifiable information available 
        to us, the State does not collect such information from you. Be aware 
        that government agencies may request personally identifiable information 
        from you in order to perform requested specialized services. </p>
      <p class="text">E-mail or other information requests sent to a State website 
        may be saved and used to respond to the request, forward the request to 
        the appropriate agency, communicate updates to the State site that may 
        be of interest to citizens, or provide the State web designer with valuable 
        customer feedback to assist in improving the website.</p>
      <p class="text">Any personally identifiable information an individual provides 
        to a State site will be used solely by the State of Utah, its entities, 
        and third party agents with whom it has contracted to perform a state 
        function on its behalf, unless the information is designated as public 
        record by an individual State agency as authorized under Title 63, Chapter 
        2, <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01016.htm">302</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01017.htm">303</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/%7Ecode/TITLE63/htm/63_01018.htm">304</a> 
        of the Utah Code , entitled "Government Records Access and Management 
        Act" (GRAMA), and the State agency's website provides conspicuous 
        notice that such information is subject to public access.</p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Collection and Use of Information - Children's 
        Personally Identifiable Information</span><br>
        Except as otherwise permitted by law, the State does not knowingly collect 
        and use or disclose the personally identifiable information of a child 
        under the age of 13. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Personally Identifiable Information Available 
        from Governmental Websites</span><br>
        Information collected is subject to the access and confidentiality provisions 
        of GRAMA and other applicable sections of the Utah Code, and federal law. 
        Consequently, certain communications may be subject to public disclosure. 
        However, in these instances you will be notified on the agency website 
        under the conditions described below in "State Agency Privacy Policies 
        and How They Relate to This Policy." </p>
      <p class="text">All records that are prepared, owned, received, or retained 
        by a governmental entity that may be reproduced by certain means are considered 
        public, unless they are private, controlled or protected as outlined in 
        Sections 63-2-302, 63-2-303, and 63-2-304 of the Utah Code, or are records 
        to which access is restricted according to court rule, other State law, 
        federal law, or federal regulation. Information that is generally considered 
        public record under GRAMA - and not made confidential elsewhere in the 
        Utah Code or by federal law - may be subject to electronic access through 
        Utah.gov websites. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Data Security and Quality</span><br>
        The State of Utah is committed to data security and the data integrity 
        of personally identifiable information available from or collected by 
        State government websites. The State has taken precautions to protect 
        personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or alteration. 
        Any authorized third parties responsible for this information are committed 
        to the same principles, and are required by contract to follow the same 
        policies and guidelines as the State of Utah in protecting this information. 
        Visitors should be aware, however, that even though protections are in 
        place, the State cannot guarantee against the occurrence of hardware failure, 
        unauthorized intrusion or other technical problems. </p>
      <p class="text">Unless otherwise prohibited by State law, federal law, or 
        federal regulation, an individual may access and correct personally identifiable 
        information whether or not the inaccuracy was created by accident, unauthorized 
        access, or a change in circumstances. The State also reserves the right 
        to use any legally appropriate measures to prevent, monitor, and investigate 
        any attempt to deface, delete or otherwise tamper with or abuse a State 
        website, server, database, information system or other State technology 
        asset.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">State Agency Privacy Policies and How 
        They Relate to This Policy</span><br>
        A privacy policy issued by a State agency for its website may provide 
        additional detail to, but not conflict with, this privacy policy, except 
        as required by an applicable State law, federal law, or federal regulation. 
        Any State agency or organization who collects or uses personally identifiable 
        information in a manner inconsistent with this policy as a result of an 
        applicable State law, federal law, or federal regulation, will adopt and 
        issue a privacy policy of its own. The privacy policy it issues shall 
        describe how its collection and use of personally identifiable information 
        differs from the State's practices as set forth in this policy. The agency's 
        privacy policy will be conspicuously posted for your review. The privacy 
        policy issued by the agency or organization will apply to its own website. 
        In addition to this policy, we also recommend that you refer to the applicable 
        agency privacy policy to obtain a description about how your personal 
        information is collected and used.<br>
        <br>
        An agency may not substitute its own privacy policy for this policy, unless 
        a state law, federal regulation or federal statute requires an agency 
        to treat personally identifiable information in a way that is inconsistent 
        with this policy. In this case, an agency may opt-out of the specific 
        provision of this policy which conflicts with the state statute, federal 
        regulation or federal statute. If that occurs, the remainder of the provisions 
        of this policy shall apply to the agency.</p>
      <p class="text">A full description of how agencies are to inform you if 
        your personal information is treated any differently than as described 
        in this policy is provided in <a href="http://www.rules.state.ut.us/publicat/code/r365/r365-005.htm">R365-5-1 
        et seq</a>. of the Utah Administrative Code, which governs the actions 
        of state agencies. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="bold">Non-State Websites</span><br>
        Visitors may link to various websites from State web pages. The State 
        is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of external sites. 
        Many of these sites, particularly those in the private sector, may not 
        be subject to GRAMA, other sections of the Utah Code, or federal law. 
        Those visiting external sites are advised to check the applicable privacy 
        statement and be cautious about providing personally identifiable information 
        without a clear understanding of how the information will be used.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Changes to and Versions of the Privacy Policy</span><span class="text"><br>
        This privacy policy may be changed at any time; any changes will be posted 
        on this web page. The version number and date the policy was last revised 
        will be noted on the policy. Information collected while a particular 
        version of this policy is in effect will be handled in accordance with 
        that version. If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact 
        us:</span></p>
