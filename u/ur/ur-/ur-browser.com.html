    <h2>UR Browser Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h4>Last modified: 25-Oct-2016</h4>
    <p>
    The ADAPTIVEBEE Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use ADAPTIVEBEE 's products and services, including when you use UR
    Browser to access those products and services. This ADAPTIVEBEE Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices that are specific to UR Browser.
</p>
<p>
    ADAPTIVEBEE will notify you of any material changes to this policy, and you will always have the option to use UR Browser in a way that does not send any
    personally identifiable information to ADAPTIVEBEE, or to remove your information and discontinue using it.
</p>
<p>
    The UR Browser EULA is available at the following URL: <a href="http://www.ur-browser.com/eula">www.ur-browser.com/eula</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    1. Information ADAPTIVEBEE receives when you use UR Browser.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    You do not need to provide any personally identifying information in order to use UR Browser.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    When you use any browser, including UR Browser, to contact ADAPTIVEBEE's servers, by default ADAPTIVEBEE receives standard log information including your
system’s IP address and one or more cookies. You can configure UR Browser to not accept cookies from ADAPTIVEBEE or other sites.    <a href="http://www.ur-browser.com/cookies">Learn more about configuring cookies and site data in UR Browser.</a>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    If you use UR Browser to access other ADAPTIVEBEE services the fact that you are using UR Browser does not cause ADAPTIVEBEE to receive any special or
    additional personally identifying information about you. In addition, some UR Browser features may send limited additional information to ADAPTIVEBEE or
    your default search engine :
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · When you use UR Browser’s default search engine, UR Browser will contact ADAPTIVEBEE’s servers when it starts or when you change networks so as to
    determine the best local web address to send search queries. When you type URLs or queries in the UR Browser address bar (omnibox) or App Launcher search
    box, the letters you type may be sent to your default search engine so that the search engine’s prediction feature can automatically recommend terms or
    URLs you may be looking for. If you accept a predicted query or URL, UR Browser may send that information from the browser to your default search engine as
    well;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · If you navigate to a URL that does not exist, UR Browser may send the URL to ADAPTIVEBEE so we can help you find the URL you were looking for. We may
    also use this information in an aggregated way to help other web users - e.g. to let them know that the site may be down;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · UR Browser periodically contacts ADAPTIVEBEE to perform functions such as checking for updates, checking connectivity status, validating current time,
    and estimating the number of active users. Each copy of UR Browser includes a temporary randomly-generated installation number which will be sent to
    ADAPTIVEBEE when you install and first use the product. The temporary number will be promptly deleted the first time that UR Browser automatically checks
    for updates. If you received or reactivated your copy of the UR Browser as part of a promotional campaign, it may also generate a non-unique promotional
    tag which is sent to ADAPTIVEBEE when performing searches with ADAPTIVEBEE and a unique token which is sent to ADAPTIVEBEE when you first run and use the
    browser after installation, reinstallation, or reactivation.. Furthermore, field trials may result in different variations of UR Browser, and UR Browser
    may send non-unique information to ADAPTIVEBEE about which variation is active;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · UR Browser may provide you with shortcuts to various third-party chat services. By using such services you consent to the terms, licenses and privacy
    policies of the respective third-parties. No parts of such services are hosted by ADAPTIVEBEE, and no information is transmitted through ADAPTIVEBEE
    servers. ADAPTIVEBEE shall not be liable for any content, information, malfunction or any other functions or problems related to the chat services, as it
    only provides the users with conventient shortcuts to access them. For any questions or requests regarding the terms, licenses or policies of
    third-parties, please contact them;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · If you use the Translate feature of UR Browser, it will send the text you choose to be translated to third parties for translation;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · If you use the Spellcheck feature of UR Browser it will send the text you type to third parties for spelling and grammar suggestions;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · If you use UR Browser’s location feature, which allows you to share your location with a web site, UR Browser will send local network information to
    Google Location Services as it uses this service in order to provide its location information. Use of the Location Service is subject to the Google Privacy
    Policy (<a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a>). Location services and other aggregated information may
    also be used to deliver location customized content to the user;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · The Weather widget of the UR Homepage feature uses your location to automatically display relevant information. The widget communicates with a
    third-party server, in order to provide you with such information. No personally identifiable, unrelated to location, information is collected, stored or
    shared via this feature with third parties. ADAPTIVEBEE does receive standard anonymous usage data, only for internal statistical purposes and in
    accordance to this Privacy Policy;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · When using the Moods feature you may set UR Browser to automatically detect the wi-fi status or other triggers. Such setting are part of the custom Moods
    triggers, and some may be enabled or disabled by the user;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · UR Browser may send usage statistics and crash reports to ADAPTIVEBEE. This setting will apply to all users for a given installation of UR Browser. The
    usage statistics and crash reports help us diagnose problems, help us understand how users interact with UR Browser, and help us improve UR Browser's
    performance;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · UR Browser tries to avoid sending information that identifies you personally. Crash reports, however, can contain system information at the time of a
    malfunction, and errors leading up to a malfunction.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    2. Information ADAPTIVEBEE sends when you use the Safe Browsing feature on UR Browser.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    ADAPTIVEBEE’s UR Browser includes Google’s Safe Browsing feature. Safe Browsing sends and receives information between the browser you are using and
    Google’s servers about suspicious websites - for example when you visit a site that is suspected to be a phishing or malware site.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Use of the Google Safe Browsing Service is subject to the Google Terms of Service (<a href="http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html">www.google.com/terms_of_service.html</a>) and to Google's Privacy Policy (    <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a>).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    3. Information website operators receive when you visit a site using UR Browser.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Sites that you visit using UR Browser will automatically receive standard log information similar to that received by ADAPTIVEBEE. These sites may also set
    their own cookies or store site data on your system. You can restrict cookies and other site data in UR Browser's preferences page.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    If UR Browser’s network actions prediction features are enabled, UR Browser may look up the IP addresses of all links on webpages and open network
    connections to load webpages faster. Sites can also use pre-rendering technology to pre-load the links that you might click next.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    If you use UR Browser in incognito mode or guest mode, it will not transmit any pre-existing cookies to sites that you visit. Sites may deposit new cookies
    on your system while you are in these modes; these cookies will only be temporarily stored and transmitted to sites while you remain in incognito / guest
    mode. They will be deleted when you close the browser, close all open incognito windows or exit guest mode.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to use UR Browser’s location feature, this service allows you to share your location with a site. UR Browser will not allow a site to access
    your location without your permission. ADAPTIVEBEE does not have control over third party websites or their privacy practices. Please carefully consider
    any website’s privacy practices before consenting to share your location with that website.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    4. Information stored on your system when you use UR Browser.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    UR Browser stores some information locally on your system. This may include:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · Basic browsing history information, for example the URLs of pages that you visit, a cache file of text and images from those pages, and a list of some IP
    addresses linked from pages that you visit;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · A searchable index of most pages you visit (except for secure pages with "https" web addresses, such as some bank pages) Thumbnail-sized screenshots of
    most pages you visit;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · Cookies or web storage data deposited on your system by websites you visit;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · Locally-stored data saved by Add-ons;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · A record of downloads you have made from websites.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    You can always choose to <a href="http://www.ur-browser.com/history">delete your browsing history information</a>, in whole or in part.
</p>
<p>
    You can also limit the information UR Browser stores on your system by using incognito mode or guest mode. UR Browser offers both modes. Incognito mode is
    useful if you would still like to have access to information from your existing profile, such as suggestions based on your browsing history, while you are
    browsing. Guest mode is useful if you would prefer to begin a browsing session without seeing information from any existing profiles. In either of these
    modes, UR Browser will not store basic browsing history information such as URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you
    visit. It will also not store snapshots of pages that you visit or keep a record of your downloads (although this information could still be stored
    elsewhere on your system, e.g. in a list of recently opened files). New cookies received in these modes will not be saved after you close your browser,
    close all open incognito windows or exit guest mode. You can see when you are in incognito / guest mode because the incognito icon appears in the top
    corner of your browser; in some cases the border of your browser window may also change color. When you make changes to your browser configuration, such as
    by bookmarking a web page or changing your settings, this information is also saved. These changes are not affected by incognito / guest mode.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to have UR Browser save your passwords for specific websites. Stored passwords can be reviewed in UR Browser settings.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    5. Information received and sent when using UR Phone feature.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · The UR Phone feature allows the user to connect various devices using UR products and to share both Personal and non-Personal Information between them,
    in order to conventiently access such information from multiple locations or at a specific time. All the collected Personal and non-Personal Information,
    the user has consented to synchronize, is required in order to make the UR Phone feature available;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · Upon activation of some or all of this feature’s functionalities, collected Personal Information may include, but is not limited to: (a) for the messages
    feature: the display name, email, phone number, message body, contact id, timestamp; (b) for the call feature: the display name, email, phone number,
    contact, date, call type (made, received, missed); (c) for the app notifications feature: app name and id, notification text and title, timestamp;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · UR Phone may require the user to log in with an account created on a third-party service. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of such
    third-parties. Depending on your account of choice, you are encouraged to review the corresponding third-party’s terms. Collected Personal Information may
    include: display name, email, profile picture URL. Logging in to any such services is done at the user’s explicit consent.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
. Currently, the UR Phone feature may be available only on devices running UR Launcher or UR Browser. You can view the UR Launcher Privacy Policy    <a href="http://urlauncher.com/#/privacy-policy">here</a>. Updates to the list of products compabile with UR Phone will be done accordingly.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · User security and choices are important for ADAPTIVEBEE. The user may choose to delete some or all of the information stored about him or her by UR
    Phone, by accessing UR Settings → UR Account from within UR Launcher. If, after the time of deletion, UR Phone is still active on any device, further data
    may continue to be collected, until the feature is expressly disabled on all devices.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    6. Unique Identifiers for Digital Rights Management.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    In order to allow certain content to be accessed using UR Browser for Windows, UR Browser may be required to provide selected content partners and websites
    using Adobe Flash Access with a unique identifier that is stored on your system. You can disable this feature in the settings or reset the unique
    identifier’s value by reinstalling the operating system. Parties to whom your unique identifier is provided could associate it with personally-identifiable
    information you provide to them. If you are accessing content from a third party service, you should review those parties’ privacy policies to learn more.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    7. Using apps, extensions, themes, services, and other add-ons with UR Browser.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    You may use apps, extensions, themes, services and other add-ons ("Add-ons") with UR Browser, including some that may be pre-installed or integrated with
    UR Browser and some that you may obtain from other sources.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Before installing an Add-on, you should review the requested permissions. Add-ons may be designed to store, access, and share data stored locally or in
    your online accounts. Add-ons may use notifications that are sent through ADAPTIVEBEE servers. UR Browser may check for, download, and install updates to
    your Add-ons. UR Browser may send usage indicators to ADAPTIVEBEE for installed Add-ons. Some add-ons might require access to a unique identifier for
    digital rights management or for delivery of push messaging. You can disable the use of such an identifier by removing the add-on from UR Browser.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Add-ons developed and provided by ADAPTIVEBEE may communicate with ADAPTIVEBEE servers and are subject to these Policies unless otherwise indicated.
    Add-ons developed and provided by third parties are the responsibility of such third parties and may be subject to third party privacy policies. For
    example, a version of the Adobe Flash Player plug-in is preinstalled with UR Browser. Adobe’s website at www.adobe.com provides more information on Adobe’s
    privacy practices with regard to Flash Player.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    8. Uses.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Information that ADAPTIVEBEE receives when you use UR Browser is processed in order to operate and improve UR Browser and other ADAPTIVEBEE services.
    Information that other website operators receive is subject to the privacy policies of those websites. UR Browser stores information on your system in
    order to improve UR Browser’s performance and to provide you with useful features and services.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    9. Phishing.
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise
    disclose Non-Identifying Information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared
    in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
    11. Service Providers.

    unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via conspicuous posting
    on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or
    (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
</p>
<p>
</p>

    advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s
    website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of
    our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control
    over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information
    from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the
    privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
