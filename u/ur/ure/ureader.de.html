		<p align="justify">This Privacy Policy explains our policy regarding the privacy   of information supplied by users or collected by us from users of this web site   or from other third parties. Because we want to build users' trust and   confidence in our privacy practices, we want to disclose them to   you.<br>

        <br>

        <strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement </strong><br>

        If we decide   to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy   statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are   aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what   circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br>

        We reserve the right to modify this   privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.&nbsp; If we make   material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means   of a notice on our home page.</p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Registration Newsletter/ Frequency of Mailings </strong><br>

        By registering to our newsletter, you are agreeing to receive our   newsletters on a daily basis. <strong>www.ureader.de   </strong> has the   right to change frequency of delivery of its newsletters without notice. </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Collection and Use of information </strong><br>

        We   respect your right to privacy. <strong>www.ureader.de   </strong> received   your information from your submission to us or through one of our   affiliates.<strong> www.ureader.de   </strong> is the owner of the   information that you provided in any registration process. Your email address   and any other identifying information that you give us will not be revealed to   any third party, including any of the direct marketers who may use us to pass   offers to you. </p>

      <p align="justify">We use the information that you provided primarily to send you   our newsletters. Moreover, the information subscribers give us is sometimes used   to send prizes, verify legal age, and to send third-party mailings based on the   interests that each individual subscriber has opted-in for. We may also collect   and report to third parties (such as affiliates, content and service providers,   and advertisers) aggregated information from our web site. For example, we may   aggregate and report to third parties that X people purchased a particular   product during a month, or that Y% of visitors to this web site are between the   ages 25-34. </p>

      <p align="justify">From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to   participate in contests or surveys on our site.&nbsp; If you participate, we will   request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in   these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you, therefore, have a   choice whether or not to disclose this information.&nbsp; The requested information   typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and   demographic information (such as zip code). </p>

      <p align="justify">As is true of most web sites, we also gather certain   information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes   internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),   referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream   data.&nbsp;We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to   analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the   site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp;We do   link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information   like IP addresses and email addresses. However, this is solely for internal uses   and used to verify appropriate registration methods. </p>

      <p align="justify">Finally, <strong>www.ureader.de   </strong> may disclose   subscriber information in response to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal   processes. </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Children </strong><br>

        We are committed to the safety of   children and do not intend to collect personally identifiable information from   children under age 18.

We will not intentionally use personal information from or send   marketing communications to children under age 13 without prior parental   consent. </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Cookies </strong><br>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable) </strong><br>

        We maintain the right to share aggregated demographic information   about our subscriber base with our partners and advertisers.&nbsp; This information   does not identify individual subscribers.&nbsp; We do not link aggregate user data   with personally identifiable information. </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Third-Party Links </strong><br>

        For your convenience,   our newsletter contains links to third-party web sites that are not owned or   controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these   other web sites. We encourage you to note when you follow links in our   newsletters and to read the privacy statements of these other web sites. We   encourage you to be aware when you leave our newsletter and to read the privacy   statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable   information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by <strong>www.ureader.de   </strong></p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Security </strong><br>

        We use certain efforts to secure   our web site. We will periodically review our security policies and implement   changes from time to time. However, we cannot and do not guarantee complete   security, as it does not exist on the Internet. If you have any questions about   security on our web site, you can send an email </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Business Transitions </strong><br>

        In the event <strong>www.ureader.de   </strong> goes through a business transition, such   as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its   assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets   transferred.&nbsp; You will be notified via prominent notice on our web site prior to   any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Choice/Opt-out </strong><br>

        If you no longer wish to   receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of   receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or   communication or by emailing us </p>

      <p align="justify"><strong>Acceptance of Terms </strong><br>
