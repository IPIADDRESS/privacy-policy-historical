                <h4>How do we protect your information?</h4>
                <p>
                    Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. We use regular Malware Scanning.

                <h4>Where does URI Online Judge store your data?</h4>
                <p>
                    Our services are hosted in the Digital Ocean cloud. By default, URI Online Judge hosts in the New York (US) regions. The data we collect is stored on those servers located in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As URI Online Judge is made in Brazil, a backup copy of all the data we collect from our website and the source-codes you submitted are also stored in our on-site server.
                </p>

                <h4>How long does URI Online Judge retain data?</h4>
                <p>
                    URI Online Judge maintains all collected data until we mark users as non-active or a user deletes their own account. Users can delete their own accounts and data here. However, not all the information is deleted from our services and backups. A complete list of what is and what is not removed is available on the "Delete Account" page and also is described in our Terms of Service.
