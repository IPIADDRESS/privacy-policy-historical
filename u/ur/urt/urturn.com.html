	  <p>          By installing or using any urTurn Application (as defined in the “User  Agreement”), you hereby confirm that you have read and understand the <span class="link"><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/mybucks/?action=terms">Terms</a></span> and this  Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be considered part of the Terms and  applicable to your participation in any urTurn Application.

	  <ol>
	    <li>urTurn makes it easy for you to get more out of your time spend on certain websites on the internet by allowing you the ability to earn, use and trade Points.&nbsp; We  understand you may not want the information you share on urTurn to be  indiscriminately distributed to every marketing and advertising company out  there, and as such we are developing policies that will only allow disclosure  of such information to trusted urTurn partners and affiliates.&nbsp; Participation in the urTurn Application often  requires you to share information with us and other Users, however, unless  otherwise provided in this policy, we will not share your personal information  with other Users.&nbsp; You may choose what  information you feel is appropriate to share with other Users. <br>
	      <br>
	    </li>
	    <li>urTurn's Privacy Policy is designed to help you  understand how we collect and use the personal information you share with us,  and to help you make informed decisions when participating in the urTurn  Application.&nbsp; Even so, as urTurn grows  and technologies change, so will our policies.&nbsp;  If you have comments or suggestions as to urTurn’s Privacy Policies you  may send the same to contact@urTurn.com.<br>
	      <br>
	    </li>
	    <li>        We reserve the right to change our Privacy  Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at  the top of this page the Privacy Policy's new effective date. If we make  material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or  through notice within the urTurn Application. We encourage you to refer to this  Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy  policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all  information that we have about you and your User account. </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p><strong class="privacytitle2">COLLECTION  AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CONTENT</strong> | <a href="#top1">Back to top</a> </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>The Information We Collect. When you install and  participate in the urTurn Application, we request or are provided access to  various types of your personal information. <br>
            <br>
	      a. We are provided with personal information that you knowingly disclosed to  the host web platform (i.e. Facebook, Myspace (coming soon), etc.), which may include your  name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender,  schools attended, and any other personal or preference information provided to  the hose web platform; <br>
	      <br>
	      b. When you install any urTurn App, we collect your browser type and IP  address. This information is gathered for all Users. In addition, we store  certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a  piece of data stored on your computer tied to information about you. We use  session ID cookies to confirm that Users are logged in. These cookies terminate  once the User closes the browser; <br>
	      <br>
	      c. When you participate in any urTurn Application or any urTurn Auction,  information, such as bids placed, Auction Items bid upon, winning bid amounts,  and other transaction details are collected and stored by us; <br>
	      <br>
	      d. urTurn may also collect information about you from outside sources such as  newspapers, blogs,&nbsp; and other users of  the Program ("Public Information") (information described in 1(a)-(d)  above is collectively "User Information"); <br>
	      <br>
        </li>
	    <li>Use of Content and Information. By participating  in the urTurn Application, you consent to have your User Information Content  transferred to and processed in the United States, and used in the following  manner: <br>
            <br>
	      a. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not  your password) to make it easier for you to login. You can remove or block this  cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this  convenience feature; <br>
	      <br>
	      b. We may occasionally use your User Information to send you notifications regarding  new services offered by urTurn that we think you may find valuable. <br>
	      <br>
	      c. We may send you urTurn-related announcements from time to time through the  general operation of the urTurn Application. You will usually be given the  opportunity to opt out of such emails by a link contained in the e-mail,  however, urTurn reserves the right to send you notices about your User account  even if you opt out of email notifications. <br>
	      <br>
	      d. We may use your User Information without identifying you as an individual to  third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating statistics regarding  the users of urTurn and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we  can provide you the urTurn Application.&nbsp;  We may also use this data for research and educational purposes. &nbsp;<br>
	      <br>
	      e. We may use Public Information to make the urTurn Application more beneficial  and customized to you.<br>
	      <br>
	      f. Generally we do not provide contact information to third  party marketers without your permission, unless such marketers are partners or  affiliated with urTurn. Otherwise, we share your information with third parties  only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably  necessary to offer the urTurn Application, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted  by you. For example, we may provide User Information to service providers to  help us bring you the urTurn Application. Specifically, we may use third  parties to facilitate our business, such as in redemption fulfillment, to send  out email updates about urTurn, to remove repetitive information from our User  lists, or to process payments for products or services and UrPoints transfers.  In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service  providers may have access to your User Information for use for a limited time  in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties  for the processing of any personal information, we will implement reasonable  contractual protections limiting the use of that information to the urTurn specified  purposes. <br>
          <br>
	    g. We may be required to disclose User Information pursuant to lawful requests,  such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do  not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information  request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal  standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we  believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or  property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the urTurn  Application or using the urTurn name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This  may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or  government agencies. <br>
        <br>
	    h. We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce  providers through sponsored groups or other urTurn Application offers. We may  offer or provide services jointly with other companies on urTurn. You can tell  when another company is involved in a service provided on urTurn, and we may  share customer information with that company in connection with your use of  that service. <br>
        <br>
	    i. If the ownership of all or substantially all of urTurn were to change, your  User Information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can  continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your User Information  would remain subject to this Privacy Policy. </li>
	    </ol>
	  <p><strong class="privacytitle2">LINKS</strong> | <a href="#top1">Back to top</a> <br>
          <br>
	    The urTurn Application may contain links to other websites. We are not  responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage you to  be aware when you leave any urTurn Application to read the privacy statements  of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by urTurn. </p>
	  <p><strong class="privacytitle2">THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS</strong> | <a href="#top1">Back to top</a> <br>
          <br>
        Advertisements that appear within the urTurn Application are sometimes  delivered (or "served") directly to Users by third party advertisers.  They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party  advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies  such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1  gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize  advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize  your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the  effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way,  they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or  browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are  clicked. urTurn does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be  placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers may have access  to your contact information stored on the host web platform and you are advised  to read the privacy policy of the host web platform. This Privacy Policy covers  the use of cookies by urTurn and does not cover the use of cookies or other  tracking technologies by any of its advertisers. </p>

If you have any questions about the Program's       security, please contact us.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
	    <li>We       cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to       share User Information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that the       information you post in the urTurn Application will not be viewed by       unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any       privacy settings or security measures contained in the urTurn Application       or the host web platform. We collect and retain User Information so that       we can provide you the urTurn Application and offer personalized features.       When you update your User Information, we may keep a backup copy of the       prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the       prior version of that information. <br>
	      <br>
	    </li>
	    <li>Any       improper collection or misuse of User Information is a violation of the       Terms and should be reported to urTurn immediately. </li>

          <br>
	    If you choose to refer friends to urTurn, we will ask you for information  needed to send your friend an invitation to participate in the urTurn  Application, such as the friend's email address.

        <li>Children       under the Age of 13. urTurn does not knowingly collect or solicit personal       information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such       persons to register.
