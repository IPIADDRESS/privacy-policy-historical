		Privacy &amp; Security Information:</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">Since 
		SurviveInPlace.com is focused on helping people with operational 
		security issues, we are in an interesting position.&nbsp; On one hand, we’d like to 
		say that we don’t ever collect any information and that you are 100% 
		anonymous.&nbsp; On the other hand, we believe we have an incredibly valuable 
		product that everyone should have.&nbsp; In order to achieve that end, we 
		have to collect some information so that we know, from a sales 
		perspective, what works and what doesn’t.&nbsp; In addition, we simply must 
		have some information (billing) to be able to get compensated for our 
		services.&nbsp; In short, we won’t spy on you, your computer, or give away 
		your information.&nbsp; With that in mind, here is our privacy policy.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">Any consumer 
		information gathered on the SurviveInPlace.com website may be 
		used for aggregate research, promotional purposes and/or for future site 
		development. In particular we may use information gathered about you for 
		the following purposes: to verify billing information to prevent credit 
		card fraud, to fulfill your orders; to send you or, where appropriate, 
		your organization, information about us and promotional material about 
		our products together with details of any offers we may have available 
		from time to time; to monitor interest in our range of products and to 
		assist us to tailor the content of the SurviveInPlace.com 
		website to your needs by collecting information about your preferences 
		through tracking patterns of page views on the SurviveInPlace.com website; and to create a profile relating to 
		you in order to show you the content that might be of interest to you 
		and to display the content according to your preferences. &nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma">If you decide to opt-in to our 
	mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, 
	updates, related product or service information, promotions, etc. However, 
	you may opt-out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom 
	of your emails.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma" size="3"><b>Disclosure of 
		Information:</b> SurviveInPlace.com will not disclose personal 
		identifiable information that you provide on this Site to any third 
		parties other than to a SurviveInPlace.com agent, except: 1) in 
		accordance with the terms of this privacy policy statement, or 2) to 
		comply with valid legal requirements such as law, regulation, warrant, 
		subpoena or court order. &nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma" size="3"><b>Cookies:</b> 
		SurviveInPlace.com, in common with many website operators, may 
		use standard technology called cookies on this Site. Cookies are small 
		data files that are created on your computer when you visit a particular 
		website. You can disable cookies by turning them off in your browser; 
		however, some areas of this Site may not function properly if you do so. 
		&nbsp; Cookies allow us to test the effectiveness of different page 
		headlines, page formats, and offers, customize pages for you based on 
		past choices you’ve made on the site, as well as fairly pay referring 
		websites if they sent you and you purchase anything.&nbsp; 
		SurviveInPlace.com cookies do not take information from other 
		sites that you visit or give up information.&nbsp; In short, the owner of the 
		website is a privacy nut and he loves cookies.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma" size="3"><b>Policies for 
		Minors:</b> SurviveInPlace.com does not solicit or want visitors 
		who are minors.&nbsp; We like kids, but we’d rather sell to their parents or 
		older relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp; When an online visitor who is a minor registers or 
		provides any personal identifiable information, he/she is required to 
		provide the e-mail address (or on some Sites, the postal address) of 
		his/her parent or guardian. If we are made aware that we have collected 
		contact information from a minor, we will immediately remove it from our 
		mailing list and we give the parent or guardian notice via e-mail (or 
		postal mail) when their minor child registers or provides personal 
		identifiable information. The notification provides the parent or 
		guardian with instructions on how to review the information collected 
		from his/her child. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Security: </b>This Site incorporates appropriate safeguards using 
		industry standard technology to heighten the security, accuracy and 
		privacy of any personal information we have collected and we have put in 
		place reasonable precautions to protect information from loss and 
		misuse. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and 
		enhanced as required. &nbsp; </font><font face="Tahoma">For your safety 
		and protection, your credit card information is not stored on our 
		servers.&nbsp; Our payment gateway provider, Clickbank, keeps this 
		information encrypted and secure on your behalf.</font></p>
		<font face="Tahoma">
		<b><font size="3">Policy Change:</font></b><font size="3"> If we alter our privacy policy, 
		any changes will be posted on this page of our site so that you are 
		always informed of the information we collect about you, how we use it 
		and the circumstances under which we may disclose it. Please check back 
		from time to time to ensure you are aware of our current privacy policy.

		We appreciate your interest and hope that you enjoy visiting the site.</font></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
