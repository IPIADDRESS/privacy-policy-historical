<h4>

    Information we obtain from Third Parties, may receive periodic emails,
    newsletters or mailings from us with information on Urban Airship or our

<h4>
    All Internet Users - Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics
    Information, and Interest-Based Advertising
</h4>
<h5>
    Cookies
</h5>
<p>
    Like many other websites, Urban Airship or its business partners may employ
    a cookie, or small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to
    "identify" visitors, each time an Individual initiates a session on the
    Company's Sites. A cookie is set in order to identify visitors; tailor our
    Sites to you; measure and research the effectiveness of our Sites'
    features, offerings and advertisements; and authenticate users for
    registered Services. Cookies can only access Personal Information that you
    have provided on our Sites and cannot be accessed by other sites.
    Individuals also have the ability to delete cookie files from their own
    hard drive at any time by clicking on the Privacy or History tab typically
    found on the Settings or Options menu in your internet browser. However,
    please also be advised that cookies may be necessary to provide access to
    much of the content and many of the features of Urban Airship's Sites.
</p>
<h5>
    Pixel Tags/Web Beacons
</h5>
<p>
    Urban Airship may use "pixel tags," also known as "web beacons," which are
    small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Sites. A pixel
    tag can collect information such as the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of
    the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of
    the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the
    pixel tag was viewed; the browser type and language; the device type;
    geographic location; and the identification number of any cookie on the
    computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via
    HTML capable email, we or our Third Party-service providers may use "format
    sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you
    received and opened our email.
</p>
<h5>
    Analytics Information
</h5>
<p>
    We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and
    Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and
    visitor demographics on some of our Sites, and to develop website content.
    For more information about Google Analytics, please visit
    <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">
        www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
    </a>
    . You can opt out of Google's collection and processing of data generated
    by your use of the Services by going to
    <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">
        http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
    </a>
    .
</p>
<h5>
    Interest-Based Advertising
</h5>
<p>
    Through our Sites, Urban Airship may in the future allow Third-Party
    advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect
    anonymous, non-Personal Information regarding your activities (e.g., your
    IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such
    de-identified information we have collected with Third-Party advertising
    partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar
    information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering
    targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Urban Airship related
    websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as
    "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising."
</p>
<h4>
    Mobile Devices
</h4>
<p>
    Urban Airship may provide websites, applications and online resources that
    are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices.
    Urban Airship will collect certain information that your mobile device
    sends when you use such websites, applications or online resources, like a
    device identifier, location, user settings and the operating system of your
    device.
</p>
<p>
    Mobile versions of Urban Airship's Sites may require that users log in with
    an account. In such cases, information about use of each mobile version of
    the website may be associated with user accounts. In addition, Urban
    Airship may enable Individuals to download an application, widget or other
    tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these
    tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may
    transmit Personal Information to Urban Airship to enable you to access user
    accounts and to enable Urban Airship to track use of these tools. Some of
    these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from
    the tool. Urban Airship may use personal or non-identifiable information
    transmitted to the Company to enhance these tools, to develop new tools,
    for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy
    Statement or in other notices Urban Airship provides.
</p>
<h4>
    Anonymous and Aggregated Information
</h4>
<p>
    Urban Airship may use your Personal Information and other information about
    you to create anonymized and aggregated information, such as de-identified
    demographic information, de-identified location information, information
    about the computer or device from which you access the Sites or other
    online Services, or other analyses we create. Anonymized and aggregated
    information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement
    of visitors' interest in and use of various portions or features of the
    Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information,
    and Urban Airship may use such information in a number of ways, including
    research, internal analysis, analytics and any other legally permissible
    purposes. We may share this information within Urban Airship and with Third
    Parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that
    is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.
</p>
<h3>
    Choice/Modalities to Opt Out
</h3>
<p>
    You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your
    Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Statement.
</p>
<h4>
    General
</h4>
<p>
    Where you have consented to Urban Airship's Processing of your Personal
    Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by
    following the instructions in this Section 3. Additionally, before we use
    Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you,
    we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the
    opportunity to opt out. Note that, due to the nature of the Services, you
    may have to provide the email or other identifying value that is associated
    with your Personal Information in order for Urban Airship to segregate out
    the use and retention of such Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to disclosing Sensitive Data to a Third Party or Processing Sensitive
    Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose
    authorized subsequently by the individual, Urban Airship will endeavor to
    obtain each individual's explicit consent (opt-in). Where consent of the
    individual for the Processing of Personal Information is otherwise required
    by law or contract, Urban Airship will comply with the law or contract.
</p>
<h4>
    Email Communications
</h4>
<p>
    An "Unsubscribe" button will be provided at the top or bottom of each email
    communications sent by Urban Airship so that you can opt-out. However, we
    may continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or
    Services you have requested in response to such request. We may need to
    send you certain communications regarding the Urban Airship programs and
    Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications -
    e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy
    Statement.
</p>
<h4>
    "Do Not Track"
</h4>
<p>
    Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain
    web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that
    they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected
    over time and across websites or online services. At this time, there is no
    general agreement on how companies like Urban Airship should interpret DNT
    signals. Therefore, Urban Airship does not recognize or respond to
    browser-initiated DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a
computer or a mobile device. For information about "do-not-track", visit    <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org">http://www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.

<h4>
    Information We Share
</h4>
<p>
    Urban Airship does not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information
    about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement or as you
    explicitly consent. Urban Airship endeavors to require third parties to
    which it discloses Personal Information to protect Personal Information
    using substantially-similar standards to those required by Urban Airship
    (and at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the
    Privacy Shield Principles and this Privacy Statement).
</p>

    that prohibit service providers from using or sharing your personal
    information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our
    behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
</p>
<h5>
    Business Partners
</h5>
<p>
    From time to time, Urban Airship may partner with other companies to
    jointly offer products, services or programs (such as webinars, events or
    downloadable content). If you purchase, specifically express interest in or
    register for a jointly-offered product, service or program from or through
    Urban Airship, the Company may share your Personal Information collected in
    connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our business
    partners. Urban Airship does not control our business partners' use of
    shared Personal Information and their use of such information will be in
    accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your
    information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or
    specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.
</p>
<h5>

</h5>
<p>
    We may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by
    law, court order or legal process; (ii) in response to lawful requests by
    public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement
    requirements; (iii) under the discovery process in litigation; (iv) to
    enforce Urban Airship policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to
    Urban Airship; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate
    to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an
    investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or
    (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary
    or advisable.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security
    purposes - e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such
    cases, server log data containing Personal Information may be shared with
    law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection
    with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.
</p>
<h5>
    Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions
</h5>
<p>
    We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about
    you in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, any reorganization,
    sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other
    type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of our
    business or of any of the business assets or shares (including in
    connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding). Should such an event
    occur, Urban Airship will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal
    Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.

</p>
<h5>
    Data Protection Addendum
</h5>
<p>
    While the data protection, privacy and other laws of the United States
    might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps
    to protect your privacy, including offering a Data Protection Addendum
    (DPA) to our agreement.
</p>

    Privacy Shield Framework
</h5>
<p>
    Urban Airship complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and
    Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of
    Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal

<p>
    With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the
    Privacy Shield Frameworks, Urban Airship is subject to the regulatory
    enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain

<h3>
    Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure and Restriction
</h3>
<h4>
    Your Personal Information
</h4>
<p>
    You may seek confirmation regarding whether Urban Airship is Processing
    Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and
    ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is
    inaccurate or has been Processed in violation of applicable data protection
    laws. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may use the email
    address set forth in Section 8 of this Privacy Statement to request access
    to, receive (port), restrict Processing, seek rectification or request
    erasure of Personal Information held about you by Urban Airship. Such
    requests will be Processed in accordance with local laws. Although Urban
    Airship makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to
    their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Urban
    Airship is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where
    the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others' privacy
    or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access
    would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual's privacy in the
    case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Urban Airship
    determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we
    will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been
    made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your
    privacy, Urban Airship will take commercially reasonable steps to verify
    your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your
    Personal Information.

    may be required by law. If Personal Information pertaining to you as an
    individual has been submitted to us by a Customer as Customer Data and you
    wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or
    delete such data, please inquire with the relevant Customer directly.
    Because Urban Airship personnel have limited ability to access Customer
    Data, if you wish to make your request directly to Urban Airship, please
    provide the name of the relevant Urban Airship customer. We will refer your
    request to that Customer, and will support them as needed in responding to
    your request within a reasonable timeframe.
