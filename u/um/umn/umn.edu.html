        Privacy Statement</h1>

      <p>The policy of the University of Minnesota is to respect the privacy of 
        all web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. This online privacy 
        statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which this web site 
        collects information, the uses to which that information will be put, 
        and the ways in which we will protect any information you choose to provide 
        us. </p>

      <p>There are four types of information that this site may collect during 
        your visit: network traffic logs, web visit logs, cookies, and information 
        voluntarily provided by you.</p>

      <h2>Network Traffic Logs</h2>
      <p>In the course of ensuring network security and consistent service for 
        all users, the University employs software programs to do such things 
        as monitor network traffic, identify unauthorized access or access to 
        nonpublic information, detect computer viruses and other software that 
        might damage University computers or the network, and monitor and tune 
        the performance of the University network. In the course of such monitoring, 
        these programs may detect such information as e-mail headers, addresses 
        from network packets, and other information. Information from these activities 
        is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security and performance 
        of the University's networks and computer systems. Personally identifiable
        information from these activities is not released to external parties without
        your consent unless required by law, including Minn. Stat. 13.15.</p>
        
      <h2>Web Visit Logs</h2>
      <p>University web sites routinely collect and store information from online 
        visitors to help manage those sites and improve service. This information 
        includes the pages visited on the site, the date and time of the visit, 
        the internet address (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the domain 
        name and IP address from which the access occurred, the version of browser 
        used, the capabilities of the browser, and search terms used on our search 
        engines. This site makes no attempt to identify individual visitors from this
        information: any personally identifiable information is not released to
        external parties without your consent unless required by law, including
        Minn. Stat. 13.15. </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>Cookies are pieces of information stored by your web browser on behalf 
        of a web site and returned to the web site on request. This site may use 
        cookies for two purposes: to carry data about your current session at 
        the site from one web page to the next, and to identify you to the site 
        between visits. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you may turn them 
        off in your browser, or may set your browser to ask you before accepting 
        a new cookie. Some pages may not function properly if the cookies are 
        turned off. Unless otherwise notified on this site, we will not store 
        data, other than for these two purposes, in cookies. Cookies remain on 
        your computer, and accordingly we neither store cookies on our computers 
        nor forward them to any external parties. Unless otherwise notified on 
        this site, we do not use cookies to track your movement among different 
        web sites and do not exchange cookies with other entities. </p>

      <h2>Information Voluntarily Provided by You</h2>
      <p>
        In the course of using this web site, you may choose to provide us with 
        information to help us serve your needs. For example, you may send us 
        electronic mail (through a mailer or a web form) to request information, 
        you may sign up for a mailing list, or you may send us your address so 
        we may send you an application or other material. Any personally identifiable 
        information you send us will be used only for the purpose indicated. Requests 
        for information will be directed to the appropriate staff to respond to 
        the request, and may be recorded to help us update our site to better 
        respond to similar requests. We will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute 
        your personally identifiable information without your consent, except 
        to the extent required by law. We do not retain the information longer 
        than necessary for normal operations. Each web page requesting information 
        discloses the purpose of that information. If you do not wish to have 
        the information used in that manner, you are not required to provide it. 
        Please contact the person listed on the specific page, or listed below, 
        with questions or concerns on the use of personally identifiable information. 
      </p>
      <p>University web sites provide links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. 
        We do not control these sites and resources, do not endorse them, and 
        are not responsible for their availability, content, or delivery of services. 
        In particular, external sites are not bound by the University's online 
        privacy policy; they may have their own policies or none at all. Often 
        you can tell you are leaving a University web site by noting the URL of 
        the destination site. </p>
      <p>Minn. Stat. 13.15 provides that electronic access data may be disseminated:
         (1) to the commissioner for the purpose of evaluating electronic
         government services;
         (2) to another government entity to prevent unlawful intrusions into
         government electronic systems; or
         (3) as otherwise provided by law. </p>

        measures see the University policy, <a href="http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/it/Web/ONLINEPRIVACY.html">
        Including a Privacy Statement on U Web Pages</a>. </p>

        and its online privacy statement, contact the site administrator or these
