Universal Music Enterprises</a> as well as a multitude of record labels owned or

policy tells you what information we collect at our web sites and how we use it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br>
There are many places at our sites where you can share your personal information 
with us, and where you can communicate with others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><u><font size="2">Registration</font></u><font size="2">.&nbsp; 
Some of our sites give you the opportunity to register with us, and sometimes 
registration is required before certain site features can be used.&nbsp; Our 
registration forms may request your contact information (such as your name, 
email address, mailing address, etc.), demographic information (such as your 
country, gender, etc.), and profile data (such as your music preferences, 
entertainment practices, etc).&nbsp; You may be assigned a site username and/or 
password.&nbsp; For our internal purposes, we use this information to communicate 
with you and provide the services you have requested, and to provide a more 
personalized experience on our sites.&nbsp; For example, your registration may allow 
you to use and post to site message boards, create site profiles, etc.&nbsp; We use 
aggregate demographic and profile information about our audience in order to 
improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or for industry reporting 
purposes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><u><font size="2">Newsletters and 
Other Communications from Us</font></u><font size="2">.&nbsp; Our registered users 
and customers may receive newsletters or other email communications from our 
family of sites and record labels, as well as other Vivendi Universal companies, 
and we may also offer other users the opportunity to sign up to receive such 
information. When there is a separate sign-up for newsletters, we ask for 
contact information such as name and email address, and, occasionally, 
demographic and profile information.&nbsp; We use this information in the same manner 
as we use the contact information in the Registration process described above. 
We may offer our users the choice whether to receive mailings from others that 
we think will be of interest.&nbsp; Recipients of our mailings can unsubscribe by 
following instructions that may appear at the end of the email newsletter.&nbsp; Note 
that in order to keep our registered users informed about the operation of our 
services, we may send emails and announcements that are needed for the proper 
functioning and administration of our sites and service.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><u><font size="2">Communications 
with Us</font></u><font size="2">.&nbsp; We have features where you can submit 
information to us (such as when contacting us with a question or feedback).&nbsp; We 
will retain your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal 
purposes, and to help us to serve you better.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><font size="2">Communications with Friends</font></u><font size="2">.&nbsp; 
We may offer features where you can send information to others, such as e-cards 
or “Tell A Friend” features. We will use the contact information you enter for 
your friends to send the email or e-card.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><u><font size="2">Interactive and 
Community Features</font></u><font size="2">.&nbsp; Our sites may offer interactive 
and community features, such as message boards, chat, email accounts, instant 
messaging, profiles, personal homepages, etc.&nbsp; All information posted or sent 
through these features may be publicly available, and you should be aware that 
when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, email 
address, phone number) through these features, that information can be collected 
and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications from other 
people.&nbsp; Users’ posts may be publicly and/or internally associated with their 
profiles/screen-names.&nbsp; Users are solely responsible for the content of messages 
they post or send on public forums</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><u><font size="2">Contests, 
Sweepstakes and Surveys</font></u><font size="2">.&nbsp; We may also have contests, 
sweepstakes and surveys at our sites.&nbsp; When you enter or participate in them, we 
request contact information from you (such as your full name, email address, 
mailing address, and telephone number) and may also request demographic or 
profile information.&nbsp; We will use the information you provide for the purpose of 
conducting the promotion (for example, to contact you if you have won).&nbsp; We may 
also use the information to send you newsletters and other information we think 
may be of interest.&nbsp; Recipients of our mailings can unsubscribe by following 
instructions that may appear at the end of the email newsletter. Any personal 
information collected will be used by us and may be associated with registration 
information.&nbsp; We may share aggregate information with others.&nbsp; We may sometimes 
partner with sponsors in offering contests, sweepstakes or surveys, and may 
share (provide and receive) information with them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION<br>
Our web sites have features that automatically collect information from users to 
assist us in creating sites that honor our users’ preferences and serve their
