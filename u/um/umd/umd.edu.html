        <!-- BEGIN MAIN BODY -->
        <p>This statement pertains exclusively to the collection of personal information 
          on official university websites. <strong>Official university websites</strong> 
          use the domain names "umd.edu" and "maryland.edu" and are controlled, 
          operated, and maintained by university personnel in connection with 
          university business. However, all uses of university computing resources 
          are subject to the <a href="aup.html" title="University of Maryland's Acceptable Use Policy" target="_top">University 
          of Maryland Policy on the Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources</a>.</p>
        <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Generally, the university does not automatically collect the 
          identity of individual users of or visitors to official university websites.</strong> 
          If you are asked to provide personal information on an official university 
          website, university policy provides that you should be notified of the 
          following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The purpose for which the personal information is collected; </li>
          <li> Any specific consequences for refusing to provide the information; 
          </li>
          <li> Your right to inspect, amend, or correct personal records, if any; 
          </li>
          <li> Whether the personal information is generally available for public 
            inspection; and </li>
          <li> Whether the personal information is made available or transferred 
            to or shared with any entity. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unless otherwise notified by the collecting office, information provided 
          to the university may be shared among offices within the university 
          and with the University System of Maryland and outside entities as necessary 
          or appropriate in the conduct of legitimate university business and 
          consistent with applicable law. Because the university is a State educational 
          institution, such information may also be subject to disclosure under 
          the <a href="http://www.oag.state.md.us/Opengov/pia.htm" title="More info on Maryland's Public Information Act" target="_top">Maryland 
          Access to Public Records Act (Public Records Act)</a>. Individuals may 
          inspect and/or correct their personal information as provided by the 
          Public Records Act or applicable university policy. The university is 
          also subject to the disclosure requirements of the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html" title="Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)" target="_top">Federal 
          Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a>.</p>
        <p>Moreover, personal information you disclose to others via message boards 
          and chat rooms may be collected and used by others who are not under 
          the control of the university. </p>
        <p>The university collects information that is available from <strong>server 
          logs</strong> about user Internet connections and visits to university 
          websites. The university may use this information to analyze trends, 
          create summary statistics for the purpose of determining technical design 
          specifications, and identify system performance or problem areas.</p>
        <p>An example of information collected by servers include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" title="Wikipedia's description of IP addresses" target="_top">Internet 
          Protocol (IP) addresses</a> - a number that is assigned to your computer 
          when you log on and that is automatically identified when a computer 
          connects to a server. An IP address identifies the computer, not the 
          computer user. University servers may log and track an IP address upon 
          log-in and as the user moves from Web page to Web page within university 
          websites. The university does not normally link IP addresses to personally 
          identifiable information, so that the identity of users remains anonymous 
          to the university but not, for example, the time users log on, log off 
          and how long they visit any one site. The university uses IP addresses 
          to identify a user when necessary to enforce compliance with law or 
          university policies, for purposes of system administration, and to ascertain 
          demographics and visitor usability.</p>
        <p>Some university web pages may utilize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" title="Click for more info on browser cookies" target="_top">"cookies"</a> 
          to better serve you with more tailored information when you return to 
          our site. Cookies are identifiers that a website can send to user browsers 
          to keep on file in order to facilitate future visits to that site. Some 
          university Web pages may use cookies as a way to provide users with 
          more tailored information when they return to those web pages. Users 
          can set their browsers to receive notification when a website sends 
          them a cookie so users may accept or reject it. Note that some parts 
          of a university web page that offers cookies may not function properly 
          or may be considerably slower when users reject cookies.</p>
        <h2>Data Security </h2>
        <p> The university will take appropriate steps to protect the information 
          you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. The university 
          strives to implement security measures that protect the loss, misuse, 
          and alteration of the information under our control. The university 
          has a policy on the <a href="http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/x600a.html" title="University of Maryland's Policy on Security of Administrative Data" target="_top">Security 
          of Administrative Data</a>.</p>
        <p>Not all transmissions to and from official university websites are 
          secure: the website may not encrypt or decrypt data sent to or from 
          the website. In addition, emails that you send to a university address 
          may be subject to interception. If your communication includes personal 
          information that you do not wish to provide electronically, contact 
          the university by postal mail or telephone.</p>
        <h2>Links to Other Sites </h2>
        <p> Some official university websites link to websites that are outside 
          the "umd.edu" and "maryland.edu" domains and are controlled and operated 
          by third parties. The university is not responsible for the privacy 
          practices or the content of such third party websites.</p>
        <h2>Changes to Privacy Statement </h2>
        <p> Advances in technology, legal developments, and new university policies 
          and practices may necessitate the need to change or update this privacy 
          statement from time to time. We reserve the right to change this policy 
          without notice. It is the responsibility of the user to check this page 
          for any changes to this policy. </p>
        <h2>Questions or Complaints </h2>
        <p> Specific questions about the collection of personal information on 
          specific official university websites should be addressed to the person 
          identified on that site. </p>
        <p> If you have any comments or questions about this privacy statement 
          or complaints about official university websites, please contact: </p>
