<h2>
	<strong>IP Addresses and Cookies</strong></h2>
<p>
	We may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.</p>
<p>
	The Websites use cookies.&nbsp; Cookies are tiny text files which identify your computer to our server as a unique user when you visit certain pages on the Websites and they are stored by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies can be used to <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="recognise" data-scaytid="22">recognise</span> your Internet Protocol address, saving you time while you are on, or want to enter, the Websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We only use cookies for your convenience in using the Websites (for example to remember who you are when you want to amend your data without having to re-enter your email address and password) and not for obtaining or using any other information about you (for example targeted advertising). Your browser can be set to not accept cookies, but this would restrict your use of the Websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Please accept our assurance that our use of cookies does not contain any personal or private details and are free from viruses.&nbsp; If you want to find out more information about cookies, go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://<span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="www.allaboutcookies.org" data-scaytid="2">www.allaboutcookies.org</span></a> or to find out about removing them from your browser, go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://<span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="www.allaboutcookies.org" data-scaytid="4">www.allaboutcookies.org</span>/manage-cookies/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>
	Please note that our suppliers and advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>Where We Store Your Personal Data</strong></h2>
<p>
	We have in place appropriate technical and security measures to prevent <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="unauthorised" data-scaytid="24">unauthorised</span> or unlawful access to or accidental loss of or destruction or damage to your information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We store your personal details on a secure server.&nbsp; We use industry standard security and firewalls on our servers.&nbsp; When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using “HSBC Secure” <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="epayments" data-scaytid="30">epayments</span> section.&nbsp; Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details.</p>
<p>
	We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your information.&nbsp; Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</p>
<p>
	You are responsible for protecting against <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="unauthorised" data-scaytid="26">unauthorised</span> access to your password and to your computer.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>Security</strong></h2>
<p>
	Any payment transactions will be encrypted using “HSBC Secure” <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="epayments" data-scaytid="32">epayments</span> <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="sectionin" data-scaytid="34">sectionin</span> the payment information you provide to us to pass on to a third party to make an order for a product or service. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted over the Internet; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent <span class="scayt-misspell" data-scayt_word="unauthorised" data-scaytid="28">unauthorised</span> access.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>Your Rights</strong></h2>
<p>
	You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data to provide marketing information about Products or the Website. You can make changes to your privacy settings at the “Your Account” part of the Website. We will change what you receive within a reasonable time. However, changing your privacy settings may inhibit your ability to use the Website so we do not recommend that you do this. You can also telephone us on <em>0845 263 6586</em> to make these changes.</p>
<p>
	The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of suppliers, partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of those websites, please note that those websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies. Please check those privacy policies before you submit any personal data to those websites.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>Changes To This Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>
	We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp; Any amended Privacy Policy will be posted on the Website.&nbsp; The amended Privacy Policy will apply immediately for new users and 30 days (or such other timeframe as we say when posting) after first posting for all existing users.&nbsp; Each time you enter the Website or order a Product, you agree that the Privacy Policy current at that time shall apply to all information which we hold about you.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>Consent</strong></h2>
<p>
	By submitting data to us and using the Website, you consent to our use of your data and of anyone you represent in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time, as described above) and you are responsible for ensuring that you have authority to consent on behalf of anyone about whom you submit data to us.</p>
<p>
	You also consent to us (or third party advertisers working through our website) placing cookies on your hard drive. You can turn these off if you want, through the settings on your browser. See the “IP addresses and cookies” section above. Please note that we will not place cookies on your hard drive by which you can be personally identified; if we do, we will ask for more, further, specific consent from you.</p>
