<p>We will take reasonable steps to protect Personal Data that we hold from:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> misuse, interference and loss; and<br>
    <strong>(b)</strong> unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.<br>
</p><p>In the unlikely event that there is a serious data breach that is likely to result in a risk to Your rights and freedoms we shall, without undue delay, notify the appropriate supervisory authority.

<p><strong>(a)</strong> we hold Personal Data about You; and<br>

<p><strong>4.5 Use and disclosure of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We will only use or disclose Personal Data for the Primary Purpose where it is reasonably necessary. Use of Personal Data for the Primary Purpose will include the use of Personal Data in automated decision making processes.</p>
<p>We will only use or disclose Personal Data about You for a purpose other than the Primary Purpose (the "Secondary Purpose") where the following apply:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> the Secondary Purpose is related to the Primary Purpose and, if the Personal Data is Special Category Personal Data, the Secondary Purpose is directly related to the Primary Purpose; and<br>
    <strong>(b)</strong> You would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the Personal Data for the Secondary Purpose; or<br>
    <strong>(c)</strong> You have consented to the use or disclosure for the Secondary Purpose; or<br>
    <strong>(d)</strong> the use or disclosure of the Personal Data is required or authorized under the GDPR, an Australian law, other applicable law or a court/tribunal order.</p>
<p>You may withdraw Your consent to our use of Your Personal Data for the Primary and Secondary Purposes at any time by contacting us using the contact information contained in clause 1.2 of this Policy. However, this may affect or limit Your ability to use the Website and Cupid Media's services.</p>
<p><strong>4.6 Disclosure to Third Party Country recipients and International Organizations</strong></p>
<p>Any profile information that You have provided to us will be publicly viewable on Your profile, irrespective of the location of the viewer. By creating a profile You acknowledge that overseas recipients will be able to view Your profile.</p>
<p>In order to provide customer support, perform back office functions, perform fraud prevention tasks, or provide services to You we may need to allow our staff or suppliers (who may be located or whose resources may be located other than Your country of residence) to access Your profile information, billing information or other Personal Data that You have supplied. </p>
<p>We have implemented security measures to protect the security of Your Personal Data. However, as with any transfer of data, there are still risks of data breaches. There may be instances where Your Personal Data is transferred to Third Party Countries and International Organizations, which have not been the subject of an adequacy decision by the General Data Protection Regulation Commission. Such transfers are necessary in order for us to perform our obligations set out in the Cupid Media Website Terms of Use.
</p>
<p class="m2 p2 border border-silver bold">
    By providing Your Personal Data and Special Category Personal Data You are explicitly consenting to the international transfer and processing of such data in accordance with this Policy, in full and informed knowledge of the risks associated with such transfers and processing.
</p>
<p>You may withdraw Your consent at any time by contacting us using the contact information contained in clause 1.2 of this Policy. However, this may affect or limit Your ability to use the Website and Cupid Media's services. </p>
<p>In all other circumstances we will only disclose Personal Data to a Third Party Country recipient or International Organization if the disclosure of the information is required or authorized by or under a law of the EU, an Australian law, other applicable law or a court/tribunal order.</p>
<p><strong>4.7 Unsolicited information</strong></p>
<p>If we collect Personal Data which we have not sought or requested, and if we determine that we are otherwise permitted to collect that information in compliance with the GDPR, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or other applicable law, that information will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of this Policy. If, however, we determine that the collection of Your Personal Data is not permitted under the terms of the GDPR, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or other applicable law, then we will destroy or de-identify that information as soon as practicable, where it is lawful and reasonable to do so.</p>
<p><strong>4.8 Information not confidential</strong></p>
<p>Any material or information provided by You, save and except for any Personal Data (the use of which is governed by this Privacy Policy), will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and we may use such material or information without restriction. Specifically, Cupid Media will use such material or information (including any profile information, photographs, video or audio recordings) that You have provided to us in order to copy Your profile into any other relevant dating site owned and operated by Cupid Media. Any such material or information provided by You will be made available for other members or users of the Website to read.</p>
<p><strong>4.9 Communication</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to send electronic mail to You regarding recommended matches, notification alerts of activity such as interest alerts or message alerts, promotions or offers, changes or additions to our services, or any products and services of our affiliated businesses. Where You are a member You may manage Your email preferences by using the settings on the "Notifications" page to customize what type of email communications You wish to receive.</p>
<p><strong>5. Access, correction and portability</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 Access to Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We will provide You with access upon request to the Personal Data held by us in relation to You except to the extent that:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> giving access would be unlawful; or<br>
    <strong>(b)</strong> denying access is required or authorized by or under a law of the European Union, an Australian law, other applicable law or a court/tribunal order.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Requests for access</strong></p>
<p>To request access to the Personal Data held by us about You, You must contact us using the contact details provided in clause 1.2. Following Your request we will contact You within a reasonable time and by no later than within one (1) month from the date of receipt of Your request. We will either provide You with the requested Personal Data or notify You when we will provide You with the Personal Data. In any event, the Personal Data requested will be provided within one month of our receipt of Your request, unless we decide not to provide You with access to the Personal Data. Where we have decided not to provide You with access to the Personal Data, we will advise You of the reasons for our decision.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Data portability</strong></p>
<p>Insofar as it does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others and where You have communicated a request to us using the contact information in clause 1.2:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> where we have employed an automated means to process Your Personal Data after receiving Your written request, we will provide You with such Personal Data that we have collected in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.<br>
    <strong>(b)</strong> after receiving Your request, where technically feasible, we will transmit Your personal data directly to another data holder.</p>

<p><strong>5.4 Commercially sensitive information</strong></p>
<p>Where providing You access to Your Personal Data would reveal evaluative information generated by us in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process we will give You an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct access to the Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>5.5 Use of intermediaries</strong></p>
<p>Where we are not required to provide You with access to the Personal Data then we will, if it is reasonable to do so, give consideration to whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet our respective needs.</p>
<p><strong>5.6 Correction and erasure of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>It is Your responsibility to ensure that the information You provide to us is accurate and to update Your Personal Data as necessary.</p>
<p>If for any reason You are unable to correct any Personal Data held by us, please contact us using the contact details provided in clause 1.2 and we will take reasonable steps to correct Your Personal Data.</p>
<p>If we elect not to correct Your information, we will notify You within one month of the reason of our refusal and the mechanisms available to You to object to our refusal.</p>
<p>If we correct or erase Personal Data about You that we previously disclosed to another entity we will take reasonable steps in the circumstances to give that notification, unless it is impracticable or unlawful to do so.</p>
<p>If You wish to have Your Personal Data erased, please communicate Your request to us using the contact information provided in clause 1.2. The only circumstances in which we will not take reasonable steps to erase Your Personal Data are where we need to keep it in accordance with another provision of this Privacy Policy, the GDPR, or for any other legal reason. However, our deleting of Your Personal Data will also result in the deletion of Your Cupid Media account and will mean You are unable to access our services.</p>
<p><strong>5.7 Refusal to correct or erase</strong></p>
<p>If at any time we refuse or deny You access to Your Personal Data, or refuse to correct or erase Your Personal Data, we will provide You with reasons for such denial or refusal.</p>
<p><strong>5.8 Restriction of processing</strong></p>
<p>You may request that we limit or restrict the manner in which we deal with and process Your Personal Data. Where we are satisfied grounds for restriction exist, we will only process Your Personal Data: with Your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims against Us; or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.</p>
<p><strong>5.9 Costs</strong></p>
<p>Access to, erasure and rectification of Your Personal Data, including any communications related thereto, will generally be provided free of charge. Where Your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive in nature (particularly due to repetitiveness) we may elect to charge You a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication, or taking the action requested. Where Your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive in nature we may also refuse Your request.</p>
<p><strong>5.10 Specific objection rights</strong></p>
<p>If it becomes necessary for us to process Your Personal Data without Your consent for reasons of:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> performing a task in the public interest;<br>
    <strong>(b)</strong> the exercise of an official authority that has been vested in us; or<br>
    <strong>(c)</strong> where it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party to do so;</p>
<p>You will have the right to object to such use.</p>
<p>If You object to certain uses of Your Personal Data, we will refrain from processing Your Personal Data unless compelling legitimate grounds exist for the processing which otherwise override Your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>If we have collected Your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and elect to use such Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (to which You consent), You have the right to object at any time to such processing. Upon receiving an objection we will, as soon as is reasonably practical, cease using Your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing.</p>
