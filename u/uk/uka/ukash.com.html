<p><strong>1. Notification of Changes</strong><br>
This policy may be updated as new features and benefits are added to Ukash or as we adapt based upon suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information,[ you will be informed of such a change and] you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. The amended Privacy Policy will be posted on this Website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ukash.com">www.ukash.com</a> so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>

We do not track the Websites that you visit before or after you leave the Ukash site.</p>
<p><strong>Our Use of "Cookies"</strong><br>
A ‘cookie’ is a small file that is stored on your computer and allows us to recognize you as a Ukash customer if you return to the Ukash website using the same computer and browser. We send a ‘session cookie’ to you computer if and when you log in as a customer or merchant. Most browsers will usually allow you to change the setting of your browser so that it does not accept cookies but if you do this please be aware that the site will not operate properly. You may visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org ">www.allaboutcookies.org </a>if you would like to learn more about cookies and how to turn them off.</p>
<p>Overall cookies help us to improve the quality of our web site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile and will benefit our end users.</p>
<p>You may set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your internet browser.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Service Correspondence</strong><br>
If you send us correspondence, including emails and faxes, we retain such information in our customer records. We will also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from Ukash to you.

We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law. </p>
<p><strong>Questionnaires, Surveys, Polls and Profile Data</strong><br>
From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires, surveys and polls to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We disclose the information we collect, as described above in Section 3, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf.
