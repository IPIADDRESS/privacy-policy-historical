            <p><strong>Website privacy notice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy and Notice</strong></p>
<p>This is the privacy notice of www.ukbettingcentral.com.  In this document, “we” or “us” refers to MMA Associates LTD</p>
<p>We are company number 4472518  registered in England<br> Our registered office is at Stonecroft,  Burley Lane, Menston,LS29 6EH</p>
<p>This is a notice to tell you our policy  about all information that we record about you. It covers both information that  could identify you and information that could not.</p>
<p>We are extremely concerned to protect  your privacy and confidentiality.&nbsp; We  understand that all users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know  that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will  not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both  specific and strict. It complies with UK law [and with the laws of all  jurisdictions of which we are aware]. If you think our policy falls short of  your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, <strong>do please tell us.</strong></p>
<p>We regret that if there are one or more  points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our  web site immediately.</p>
<p>Except as set out below, we do not  share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable  information collected at this site.</p>
<p>"We use your personal information to provide the  services you've requested (i.e. process your order). We may also use  this information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and  improve our technologies and services. We will not pass your details on  to any third parties."</p>
<p>Here is a list of the information we  collect from you, either through our web site or because you give it to us in  some other way, and why it is necessary to collect it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Basic identification and contact  information</strong>, such as your name and contact details.<strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This information is used:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>to provide you with the services which  you request;</li>
<li>for verifying your identity for  security purposes;</li>
<li>for marketing our services and  products;</li>
<li>Information which does not identify any  individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide  class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a  particular page or service.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li><strong>Market place information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When we obtain information from you specifically to  enable you to buy a service offered on our web site by some other person, we  assume that in giving us your information, you are also giving us permission to  pass it to the relevant person.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your domain name and e-mail address</strong> are recognised by our servers and the pages that you visit are recorded. We  shall not under any circumstances divulge your e-mail address to any person who  is not an employee or contractor of ours and who does not need to know, either  generally or specifically. This information is used:<strong></strong></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>to correspond with you or deal with you  as you expect.</li>
<li>in a collective way not referable to  any particular individual, for the purpose of quality control and improvement  of our site;</li>
<li>to send you news about the services to  which you have signed up;</li>
<li>to tell you about other of our services  or services of sister web sites.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li><strong>Information you post on our website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Information you send to us by posting  to a forum or blog or in your advertisement is stored on our servers. We do not  specifically use that information except to allow it to be read, but you will  see in our terms and conditions that we reserve a right to use it in any way we  decide.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Website usage information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may use software embedded in our website (such as  JavaScript) to collect&nbsp; information about  which pages you view and how you reach them, what you do when you visit a page,  the length of time you remain on the page, and how we perform in providing  content to you. [We do not presently associate such information with an identifiable  person]</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Third party advertising</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Third parties may advertise on our web site. In doing  so, those parties, their agents or other companies working for them may use  technology that automatically collects your IP address when they send an advertisement  that appears on our site to your browser. They may also use other technology  such as cookies or JavaScript to personalise the content of, and to measure the  performance of their adverts. We do not have control over these technologies or  the data that these parties obtain. Accordingly, this privacy notice does not  cover the information practices of these third parties</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your  computer's hard drive through your web browser when you visit any web site.  They are widely used to make web sites work, or work more efficiently, as well  as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>
<p>Like all other users of cookies, we may request the  return of information from your computer when your browser requests a web page  from our server. Cookies enable our web server to identify you to us, and to  track your actions and the pages you visit while you use our website. The  cookies we use may last for a single visit to our site (they are deleted from  your computer when you close your browser), or may remain on your computer  until you delete them or until a defined period of time has passed.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complaining</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When we receive a complaint, we record all the  information you have given to us.&nbsp; We use  that information to resolve your complaint.&nbsp;  If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person,  we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in  your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for  our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and, if we do, what  that information is.</p>
<p>We may also compile statistics showing information  obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in  a way that could identify you or any other person.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Third party  content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our web site is a publishing medium in that anyone may  register and then publish information about himself or some other person. We do  not moderate or control what is posted.&nbsp;  If you complain about any of the content on our web site, we shall  investigate your complaint. If we feel it may be justified, we shall remove it  while we investigate. Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a  judgement as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person  who posted the content which offends you. If we think your complaint is  vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Affiliate information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is information given to us by you  in your capacity as an affiliate of us or a customer or client of ours. Such  information is retained for business use only.&nbsp;  We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of  the terms of our relationship.&nbsp; It is not  used for any other purpose.&nbsp; We expect  any affiliate to agree to reciprocate this policy. <strong>As an exception to this</strong>, we have the right to disclose your first  name and URL of your affiliate connection to other affiliates and to any other  person or organisation, on and off site. The reason is solely to enable us to  mention winners and others whose performance as an affiliate is in some way  outstanding.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use of site by children</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do not market to children, nor do we sell products  or services for purchase by children. We do sell products and services for end  use by children, but for purchase by adults. If you are under 18 leave this  site now.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disclosure to Government</strong> and their agencies. We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be  required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they  have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.&nbsp; <strong></strong></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li><strong>Compliance with the law</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This confidentiality policy has been  compiled so as to comply with the law of every jurisdiction in which we aim to  do business. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your country, we  should like to hear from you, but ultimately it is your choice as to whether  you wish to use our website.</p>
<p>If you have any question regarding the  confidentiality policy, please contact us through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the contact page</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Now <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take me back</span> where I was before reading this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Drafting notes</strong><br> <strong>Website privacy notice</strong></p>
<p><strong>General notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This privacy notice is usually referred  to as a “privacy policy”.&nbsp; The word  “notice” has been introduced by the Information Commissioner’s office and that  is why we now use it.</li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>A combination of telephone hacking and  other privacy scandals and the publication of the Privacy and Electronic  Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 has completely  changed the scenery in the area of privacy law and the expectations of those  with whom we deal.&nbsp; At the end of these  notes we provide the full text of the ICO guide on privacy notices.&nbsp; The code is to tell you what you should and  should not be saying in your privacy notice. We find it muddled and  unhelpful.&nbsp; The fact is that we all have  to comply with the new law but disclosing every cookie by name is simply  impractical.</li>
</ol>
<p>We  have therefor drawn this very comprehensive document for your use.&nbsp; The law is new.&nbsp; The ICO clearly do not know how its  requirements will unfold, and neither do we. The best we can do is to comply  with the law, while recognising that someone, somewhere may find it inadequate.</p>
<p>The  document we have provided does not magically absolve you from risk of data  mismanagement, but it is a giant first step.&nbsp;  A good privacy notice is prime evidence to everyone you deal with and to  the IBO, that you take confidentiality seriously.</p>
<ol>
<li>We have provided a menu of  possibilities, use of which depends on the structure of your business and your  website. Your privacy policy is a matter for your discretion.&nbsp; We have not tried to use magic words to  protect you from spamming and selling data abroad. This model policy is built  around:</li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>reminding you how to avoid contravening  the UK Data Protection Act and the new EU regulations;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>providing re-assurance to your  customers or clients;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>&nbsp;<ol>
<li>maintaining a professional but friendly  image.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Paragraph specific notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic  identification and contact information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is information collected by most  web sites.&nbsp; What you do with it is  obvious but including it here completes the picture.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Market  place information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To use if you take orders on your web  site for a third party.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your  domain name and e-mail address</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is information collected by most  web sites.&nbsp; Basic and obvious.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information  you post on our website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is an area often omitted from  suggested text, but it may be important.&nbsp;  The fact that someone posts insensitive or forbidden or stupid  information does not give you a licence to use it without care.&nbsp; However, well drawn terms and conditions will  make clear that contractually you have a licence to use any such information as  you decide.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Website  usage information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This information is unlikely to be personally  identifiable.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial  information relating only to your credit cards</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In this and the following paragraphs we have given you  several alternatives.&nbsp; Select the one  that most accurately reflects the way you do business.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note on  paddock symbol and trust marks</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We have added this because we ourselves have been  asked from time to time whether our site is “safe” since we do not show any  such mark. Leave it or delete it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Financial information relating only to  direct debits or your credit cards</strong><strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Provides for direct debit arrangements and explains in  plain English how they work.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  retain your credit card information securely</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Edit the five sub paragraphs to reflect how you really  do protect your financial information.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit  reference</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We suggest that you leave this paragraph in place even  if you have no immediate intention of liaising with debt collectors. It may be  a useful reminder to users of your web site.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business  and personal information</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Amidst the noise about privacy we have  to remember that we also have legal obligations to keep business financial  records</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Third party  advertising</strong><strong> </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple statement of the obvious. In  practice, the demons that appear in our systems are usually cookies of some  sort, placed by these third parties, often with the connivance of the webmaster  of a site based far away.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Regulation of cookies is probably the single most  important element of the new regulations. You must identify what cookies you  use and why so as to give a user of your site notice of what you are planting  on his hard disk. It is particularly important to mention any cookie that may  prove objectionable to someone. The purpose of this document is to tell those  who might use your web site what will happen if they do. There are thousands of  possible use of cookies.&nbsp; We have  mentioned a few of the most obvious. Add your own. (Please tell us of any we  have missed which are also obvious!)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 28&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>We have no comment on these paragraphs.&nbsp;  Select which apply to you.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data may be  “processed” outside the UK</strong> <br> It is important that this information is disclosed to  comply with the law.</p>
