<p>This website (the "<strong><u>Site</u></strong>") is operated by UKBettingCentral.com, a division of MMA Associates (Yorkshire) Ltd ("<strong><u>UKBettingCentral.com</u></strong>"). 
<br><br>This Privacy Statement (the "Statement") describes UKBettingCentral.com's collection, use and disclosure of information practices in connection with the Site.

For example, you may have arrived at a co-branded version of the Site from an Affiliate's website, in which case, that Affiliate will be clearly identified at the top of the home page of this Site.  
<br><br>In this Statement, UKBettingCentral.com refers to those versions of the Site as "<strong><u>Affiliate Versions</u></strong>." Please be aware that UKBettingCentral.com may share any information you submit through this Site with Affiliates, as described below.  During your visit to any Affiliate Version, the Affiliate may independently collect other information from you.
<br><br>For purposes of clarification, this Statement also describes UKBettingCentral.com's collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to any personally identifiable information and Usage Data (as defined below) that is provided to UKBettingCentral.com by any of its third-party distribution partners that display UKBettingCentral.com listings, such as Yahoo!.
<br><br>This Statement does not describe UKBettingCentral.com's collection, use and disclosure of information through means other than this Site (e.g., off-line) or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any Affiliate, third-party distribution partners or other third parties. For information on a third party's information collection, use and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party's website. 
<br><br>Also, please note that this Site contains links to other websites. UKBettingCentral.com is not responsible for the websites, content or privacy practices of any third party. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Statement and agree that you are subject to the <a title="" href="http://www.ukbettingcentral.com/tos.html" target="">UKBettingCentral.com Terms of Service</a>.
</p><h3><div align="center">Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</div></h3>
You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. UKBettingCentral.com automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of affiliate website you are looking for). 
<br><br>UKBettingCentral.com collects personally identifiable information only when you make it available through your use of the Site. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services on this Site, including, but not limited to, the "Contact Us" feature or the <a title="UK Betting Forum" href="http://www.ukbettingcentral.com/ukbettingforum/" target="NEW"><strong>UK Betting Forum</strong></a> or <a title="Gambling Tips" href="http://www.gamblingtipsblog.com" target="NEW"><strong>UK Betting Blog</strong></a>. 
<br><br>In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information through the Site in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email, (c) using the Site's "Contact" and "More Information" forms; and (d) in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Site. 
<br><br>We also publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the affilliates that we list or write about on the Site. If you dial one of these phone numbers, UKBettingCentral.com or a service provider operating on UKBettingCentral.com's behalf may record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with other information that may be captured.  Any Usage Data and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in this Statement. 
<br><br>The types of personally identifiable information that you provide will depend on the nature of the submission, but could include your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event that you purchase an Ad in our website, information may be stored in order to allow UKBettingCentral.com to process and maintain your ad.
<h3><div align="center">Passive Information Collection</div></h3>
The Site automatically collects information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following:

<br><br>Cookies allow UKBettingCentral.com to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or ZIP code on one of the Site's forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. 
<br><br>Cookies and web beacons can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows UKBettingCentral.com to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of UKBettingCentral.com advertising campaigns.

Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by UKBettingCentral.com to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. 
<br><br>You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site's features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding use of our Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of UKBettingCentral.com through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as "<strong><u>Usage Data</u></strong>."

<li>To send promotional materials, newsletters or other content via email or otherwise, but only if you have indicated that you wish to receive such materials (e.g., UKBettingCentral.com will send you auto show newsletters and information regarding how to sell your car on UKBettingCentral.com if you have indicated that you wish to receive such newsletters and information).  If you no longer wish to receive a particular email newsletter or other promotion from UKBettingCentral.com, you must follow the opt-out instructions included in such email newsletters and promotions.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage Data is used by UKBettingCentral.com for administrative, analytical, research, optimization and other purposes. For example, UKBettingCentral.com may use statistical analyses of Usage Data in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Site, for development purposes and to inform advertisers and partners in aggregate and anonymous terms about consumers who click on their advertising or other messages. IP addresses are also used for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.
<br><br>With respect to promotional materials and newsletters that UKBettingCentral.com may send from time to time, UKBettingCentral.com will not continue to send you such communications if you ask us not to, as described below in the Section entitled "Accessing, Changing or Deactivating Information Collected by UKBettingCentral.com." However, you agree that UKBettingCentral.com may send to you, and you cannot opt out of, communications of a transactional or relationship nature, including, but not limited to, communications regarding fraudulent or illegal activity, the status of your Account, changes to this Statement or the UKBettingCentral.com Terms of Service, as well as communications to confirm, fulfill and follow up on your registration or a request submitted through the Site.

Similarly, if through the Site you request additional information from a financial institution, UKBettingCentral.com will share your information with that institution. Personally identifiable information also may be included in reports to these third parties, but only when you have intended to submit the information to the third party as described above.

In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion on the Site that is sponsored by UKBettingCentral.com and a third party, UKBettingCentral.com reserves the right to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with the third party.

<li><u>Service Providers</u>.

Similarly, if you make a payment to UKBettingCentral.com by credit card, UKBettingCentral.com may share your personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on UKBettingCentral.com's behalf. In such cases, UKBettingCentral.com asks that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by UKBettingCentral.com.</li>
<li><u>Email List Opt-Outs</u>. In the event UKBettingCentral.com sends promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform UKBettingCentral.com you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a particular third party, UKBettingCentral.com may share your email address with that third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists.</li>
<li><u>Other</u>. UKBettingCentral.com expressly reserves the right to release any personally identifiable information or other information you provide to third parties under the following circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Site, (c) to protect the property or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of ownership of all or a part of UKBettingCentral.com.
