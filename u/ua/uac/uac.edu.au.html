  <h2><a name="policy" id="policy"></a>What is UAC's Policy Statement?</h2>
        
  <p>When you apply to the Universities Admissions Centre (NSW &amp; ACT) Pty Ltd 
    (UAC) you provide a lot of personal information, sometimes including health 
    information. </p>
  <ul>
    UAC recognises the importance of protecting  personal information and 
    is bound by the following legislation: 
    <li> <em>Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW) </em></li>
	<li> <em>Privacy Act 1998 (Cth) as amended in the Privacy Amendment (Private 
      Sector) Act 2000 (Cth)</em> </li>
    <li> <em>Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW)</em> </li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>This means that UAC must uphold the NSW State Information Protection Principles, the National Privacy Principles 
    and the NSW Health Privacy Principles. </p>
  <p>UAC is committed to upholding these principles and has implemented policies 
    and procedures to ensure these principles are met. </p>
<a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>

<h2><a name="collect" id="collect"></a>What information does UAC hold?</h2>			  
  <ul>
    The type of personal information UAC holds includes: 
      <li>your contact details (including name, address, telephone number, email 
      address) </li>
    <li> your date of birth </li>
    <li> your gender </li>
    <li> your citizenship details </li>
    <li> details of your education achievements</li>
    <li>details of your professional qualifications </li>
    <li> information related to any disability you may suffer </li>
    <li>information related to your health or the health of a family member </li>
    <li> details of your proficiency in English</li>
    <li> your HSC and other examination results</li>
    <li> your Universities Admission Index (UAI) </li>
    <li> your status as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Provision of your email address is optional.  UAC will only collect information for lawful purposes related to its function.
</p>
<a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>
<h2><a name="hold" id="hold"></a>How does UAC hold this information?</h2>
        
  <p>Your personal information is held in an archive database at UAC. </p>
  <p>If you are a current NSW Higher School Certificate student, your Year 12 
    results will be held along with Year 12 results from other states and territories 
    in Australia, in an archive database at UAC. If you are eligible for a Universities 
    Admission Index (UAI) or a Limited UAI, these will also be held in the database. 
    Your results, including your UAI if you are eligible, will also be held on 
    similar archives at tertiary admissions centres in other states in Australia. 
    Results held on these archives will only be accessed by the relevant tertiary 
    admission centre if you initiate an application for tertiary study through 
    that centre, or if you submit an application for tertiary study directly with 
    an institution participating in that centre. </p>			  
<a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>
<h2><a name="use" id="use"></a>How does UAC use this information?</h2>
        <p>UAC uses this information to process applications for admission to tertiary education institutions. This includes providing universities, other tertiary institutions and tertiary admission centres in other states and territories in Australia with the information that you have provided to us.
</p>
 <a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>
<h2><a name="parties" id="parties"></a>What about third parties?</h2>			  
  <p>To perform certain business functions, UAC may contract the services of third 
    parties, such as printing specialists. </p>
  <p>In these circumstances, where necessary, some of your information may be 
    shared with these third parties for the express purpose of undertaking the 
    specified service and for no other purpose. The same National Privacy Principles 
    bind these contractors as UAC.</p>
  <p>Your information may also be shared with any authorised representative/s 
    that you have nominated, and with any organisations with which we are required 
    by law to share the information. </p>
  <p>UAC does not buy or sell mailing lists.</p>
<a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>
<h2><a name="dec" id="dec"></a>Declaration and authority</h2>
<p>All UAC applicants are asked to sign a Declaration and authority which, among other things, outlines what UAC does with your personal information in the application process.
</p>
  <ul>

      provided by you, or any information obtained in connection with your application, 
      and to disclose such information, to all participating institutions,  Universities Australia, Universities Australia member institutions, 
      members of the Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres (ACTAC), 
      and any other authority or tertiary educational institution either in Australia 
      or overseas, where UAC reasonably considers it is necessary to make such 
      disclosure</li>
    <li> authorise any institution you attend as a result of your application 
      to provide all of your results from future studies to UAC </li>
    <li> have read and understand information published by UAC under the heading 
      <em>Collection of personal information</em> (see below) </li>
    <li> understand that UAC may disclose your personal information to the Department 
      of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and that DEEWR will collect and 
      store your personal information for use in connection with the Higher Education 
      Information Management System (HEIMS). </li>

  </ul> 
<a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>
<h2><a name="pinf"></a>Collection of personal information</h2>
<p>UAC collects personal information and, in some circumstances, information regarding your health

                        <br>
                        While your personal information is generally collected from you, UAC also collects information about
                        you from other educational institutions that you have attended.<br>
                        <br>
                        UAC provides your personal information and, where applicable, your health information, to tertiary institutions to which you make an application for admission.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you do not provide personal information where required in your application, UAC will not be
                        able to process your application.<br>
                        You may seek access to  personal information about
                        you collected by UAC.<br>
                        <br>

  <p>Under the National Privacy Principles, you are generally entitled to access 
    the information UAC holds about you, but we will require proof of identity 
    - and some requests can be refused. The time it takes to respond to your request 
    depends on the type of information you require, and a fee may be charged.</p>

      your unique login and UAC PIN. No personal information is posted on the internet. </p>

<h2><a name="incorrect" id="incorrect"></a>What do I do if the information UAC holds about me is incorrect?</h2>									  
  <p>Please tell us. We want our records to be accurate, complete and up to date.

    we will generally correct it upon request, or suggest alternative arrangements 
    for updating our records. </p>
<a href="javascript:scrollTo(0,0)" class="top">^top</a>		  
<h2><a name="breach" id="breach"></a>What do I do about a breach of privacy?</h2>
