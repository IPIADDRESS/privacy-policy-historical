        <p align="center" class="toptitle">Privacy Statement</p>
        <p class="mtext">The University of Alabama respects your privacy and collects 
          no personally identifiable information about you unless you affirmatively 
          choose to make such information available to us. The University does 
          not actively share personal information about Web site visitors. Personal 
          information provided by visitors, such as e-mail addresses or information 
          submitted via online forms, is used by the University to assist individual 
          visitors as necessary. This assistance may involve redirecting an inquiry 
          or comment to another University individual or unit better suited to 
          provide resolution.</p>
        <p class="mtext">The University analyzes its Web server log files to collect 
          summary information about visitors to its Web site. This information 
          is analyzed to generate summary statistics for purposes such as guiding 
          design considerations, determining successful site segments, and determining 
          problem areas. However, because The University of Alabama is a public 
          institution, some information collected from The University of Alabama’s
        Web site may be subject to the Alabama Open Records Act, or in some 
          instances the University may be compelled by law to release information 
          gathered from University of Alabama Web servers. Some Web servers at
        The University of Alabama may adopt different privacy statements as 
          their specific needs require that differ from this statement.</p>
        <p class="mtext">The University of Alabama is a research institution. 
          At anytime there are numerous online surveys being conducted on the 
          University of Alabama Web site. Confidential information gathered in 
          these online surveys is used only for the research purpose indicated 
          in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, your 
          answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared 
          with other parties unless required by law. Aggregate data from surveys 
          may be shared with external third parties.</p>
        <p class="mtext">The University of Alabama also complies with the Family 
          Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), which prohibits 
          the release of educational records without student permission. For more 
          details on FERPA, currently enrolled students should consult the University 
          of Alabama Student Handbook or the University’s Office of Academic Records 
          and University Registrar.</p>
        <p class="mtext">Please direct any questions about this privacy statement, 
          the practices of any University of Alabama Web site, or your use of 
          this Web site to the <a href="mailto:sburks@ur.ua.edu">Office of Web
