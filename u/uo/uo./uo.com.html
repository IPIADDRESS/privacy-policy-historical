</p><p>
In addition, Electronic Arts owns several other domain names that point to the web sites listed above, and we will from time to time add new sites that may or may not be listed above.
Please note that this policy applies only to sites maintained by Electronic Arts or its subsidiaries, and not to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.
Furthermore, from time to time EA may employ third parties who may collect personal information on EA's behalf.  In such cases, such third parties will be instructed by EA to comply with
the EA Privacy Policy as set forth herein.  
</p><p>
<b>What information is collected?</b><br>
Electronic Arts only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis and only during (1) contest registration, (2) warranty registration,
(3) player match up services and (4) registration for games or special game-specific event participation. Personal information collected may include your name, e-mail
address, phone number, home address and birthdate. We do not require this information to obtain access to any of our sites; however, you will not be able to access areas
that require registration. 
</p><p>
Visitors purchasing goods and services through our online store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address,
phone number and e-mail address. 
</p><p>
<b>A special note about children 12 years old and under</b><br>
Electronic Arts encourages parents to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers,
without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, with respect to children residing
in certain jurisdictions, no information should be submitted nor posted to Electronic Arts' online sites by children 12 years of age or under. In order for children 12 years old and under
in such jurisdictions to participate in online activities that require registration, we require prior written permission from a parent or guardian (opt-in). A copy of our permission form
can be found at <a href="parentpermission.html" target="_blank">http://www.ea.com/parentpermission.html</a>. This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Electronic Arts by fax at (512) 434-6623 or by mailing to Electronic Arts c/o Origin Systems, Inc, Privacy Policy Administrator, 5918 West Courtyard Dr., Austin, TX  78730.

<b>What about cookies?</b><br>
Certain of our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.  Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your
interest and for other purposes.  (Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites.)  Certain of our sites use an outside ad company to display ads.
 These ads may contain cookies.  Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.  Some consumer data is shared with the
advertising companies.  Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas
 will not function properly if you do so. 
</p><p>
<b>What happens to the information provided?</b><br>
Electronic Arts does not disclose any personally identifying information about registered children under <b>18 years of age</b> to third parties, <u>regardless of parental consent</u>. 
</p><p>
When you register on an Electronic Arts' online site, you will be asked to provide personally identifying information.  The information you provide will allow us to alert you to new
products, features and enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; and contests and events of interest. From time to time, we are approached by companies and organizations
that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may provide your personal information to such third parties. We see this as a value-added service
 helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. 
</p><p>
Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can consistently improve our sites to better meet our visitors' needs. To enforce legal rights and the law, we may also disclose information to law enforcement.
</p><p>
<b>Opt-out provision</b><br>
When we first collect information about you, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with parties outside of Electronic
Arts or its subsidiaries (except to the extent required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority). In addition, if you do not want Electronic
Arts to send you e-mail or postal mail about our products and services, you can opt out at the time of registration or information collection.  If, at a later date, you choose to have your
 name removed from our database, you can do so by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com">privacy_policy@ea.com</a>, by calling (512) 434-6658 or by sending a fax to (512) 434-6623.
  In Europe please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com">privacy-uk@ea.com</a>.   
</p><p>
<b>Safeguarding your personally identifiable information</b><br>
We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards
 to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data
will provide sufficient protection of that personal information.
</p><p>
<b>Review, correction and deletion of information from our files</b><br>
If for any reason you are concerned that the personal information maintained by Electronic Arts is not correct, or should you wish to have your name removed from our records, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy_policy@ea.com">privacy_policy@ea.com</a> or call (512) 434-6658 or send a fax to (512) 434-6623, and we will be happy to review, update or remove
information as appropriate. In Europe please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy-uk@ea.com">privacy-uk@ea.com</a>.
