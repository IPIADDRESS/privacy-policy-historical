    <p>Membership Information: Uploaded.TV will not distribute, sell or rent  any of the personal information about you to other people or  nonaffiliated companies except to enable the provision of services or  products you have requested or when we have your permission to do so.

    <p> Your e-mail address may be used by us for communications related to the  Uploaded.TV services, including but not limited to, sending notices  about new features, products, or other information of interest to you.  Again, you can always opt out of receiving these notices.</p>

    <p>Despite our commitment to protecting your privacy, in certain  circumstances, Uploaded.TV may disclose your membership information  under the following circumstances: </p>
    <p> (a) If required to do so by law;<br>
      (b) Pursuant to a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
      </p><ul><li>1)  Enforce the Uploaded.TV Terms of Service;</li>

    <p> Since we here at Uploaded.TV give you the chance of a life time and  allow you to be on TV, we take certain measures to safe guard this  privilege by keeping personal and identifying information about you on  file. In most cases you must pay to be on TV therefore your credit card  information and personal info is on file. In some cases we must keep  your personal information, like address, phone number, credit card and  bank details on file because we take being on TV very seriously and the  governing bodies that regulate TV do as well. Our reasons for keeping  your data on file are simple. We give you an opportunity of a life  time, if you abuse this privilege by doing illegal acts, we know  exactly who you are and where you live.</p>

        </p>
      <div class="txt-blue">NOTE TO PARENTS</div>
