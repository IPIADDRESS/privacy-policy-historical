                                <h5>How Data Is Processed</h5>
                                <p>Upleap takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.</p>
                                <p>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to Upleap, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain employees in charge and the Data Controller, who are involved with the operation of this Website (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Data Controller. The updated list of these parties may be requested from Upleap at any time.</p>
                                <h5>Legalities of Data Processing</h5>
                                <p>Upleap may process Personal Data relating to Users provided one of the following is applicable:</p>
                                <div class="boxed boxed-lg">
                                    <ul class="bullets small">
                                        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Data Controller may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                                        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                                        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller;</li>
                                        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject;</li>
                                        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller</li>
                                        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or by a third party.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <p>Upleap and its Data Protection Officer can and will gladly help clarify the specific legal basis that applies to said processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
                                <h5>Where Data is Processed</h5>
                                <p>The Data is processed at the Data Controller's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                                <p>If broader protection standards are applicable, Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Data Controller to safeguard their Data.</p>
                                <p>If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Data Controller using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
                                <h5>Data Retention</h5>
                                <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the legitimate purpose they have been collected for.</p>
