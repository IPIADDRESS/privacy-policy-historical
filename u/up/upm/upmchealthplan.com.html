                        purchased for you and your family. These operations include 
                        measurement and review of all our data to see how many 
                        of our members receive certain services, such as childhood

                    as your name, address, social security number and birth date

                    to you, or the health care premiums that you or your company 
                    have paid. So whether the protected health information we 
                    have is considered health information or non-public personal 
                    financial information – we only use the information we have

                  <p><font face="Arial">Not only do all the physicians and providers 
                    in our network know that your information is private and confidential,

                    training programs for our employees to ensure that they know 
                    the procedures they need to follow to make sure that your

                    us to use your specific personal information in order to let 
                    you participate in the program, we would contact you and let 
                    you know all the details. We would request your permission 
                    and signed authorization before we would use your personal 
                    information for anything other than routine purposes that 
                    we have explained. If you decline such a request, your information 
                    will not be part of the special program enrollment.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You undoubtedly have heard a great deal 
                    about privacy in the news – especially as concerns federal 
                    legislation about privacy of health information. In addition 
                    to any new legislation, all health insurance carriers and 
                    health care providers are dealing with the Health Insurance 
                    Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and several 
                    important sets of regulations that government agencies have 
                    recently issued for HIPAA implementation and compliance. In 
                    fact, because the HIPAA Privacy Regulations require doctors, 
                    hospitals, health care insurers as well as employee benefit 
                    plans that are involved in your health care to have a "<b><a href="HIPAA-forms.htm" target="_blank">Notice 
                    of Privacy Practices</a></b>", you will probably be receiving 
                    several of these notices. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">So, in addition to this Privacy Statement, 
                    UPMC Health Plan's <b><i>Notice of Privacy Practices</i></b> 
                    will give you even more specific information and details about 
                    how we ensure the privacy of your protected health information. 
                    The Notice will also explain all the rights that you have 
                    concerning the privacy of your health information, and how 
                    you can exercise those rights.</font></p>
