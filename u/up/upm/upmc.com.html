					</h2>&nbsp;</div><div class="ArticleBody"><div class="Section"><h2 class="SectionHeader">Purpose&nbsp;</h2><p>The purpose of this policy is to clearly state how EBSCO Publishing operates its Health Library
Web sites and how information (if any) is collected from users and used EBSCO Publishing.</p></div><div class="Section"><h2 class="SectionHeader">The Policy&nbsp;</h2><div class="Section"><a name="A"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Introduction&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing is a leader in setting ethical standards for Internet consumer health Web sites
and our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. We present this policy to give
you a clear understanding of how we operate our Web site and how we collect information from
you and how it is used by us.</p><p>The information you provide, whether it is when you research a topic of interest or elect to register
for certain services, is personal to you. EBSCO Publishing will not disclose your personal health
information or the subjects that you search while visiting EBSCO Publishing (or a member of the
EBSCO Publishing Network) to third parties without your consent.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="B"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Registration&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing does not require users to register in order to gain access to the Health
Library.</p><p>There are some services that EBSCO Publishing does license that require registration. As of
March 2006, EBSCO Publishing licensed the HealthStatus Personal Health Manager.</p><p>When you use this feature, it is hosted on the HealthStatus site and this site will clearly disclose
what information is required, what information is optional and how that information may be used.
HealthStatus is not affiliated with EBSCO Publishing.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="C"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Personal Information&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing does not store any personal health information..</p><p>Personal information submitted by you when you are using HealthStatus’s Personal Health
Manager is transmitted to HealthStatus and not stored by or made available to EBSCO
Publishing.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="D"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Aggregate Data&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing collects data from the Web logs of the servers -- the computers that “serve
up” Web pages -- delivering the EBSCO Publishing -copyright-owned content sources. This
includes information about what you view and, along with information gathered from our other
users, we create “aggregate data” reports that we may disclose to third parties. The third parties
with whom we share aggregate data with may include our “Information Partners,” or the
companies, organizations and professional societies that supply us the medical information that
you access, and applicable members of the EBSCO Publishing Network. The EBSCO Publishing
Network consists of those hospitals and other Web sites with which EBSCO Publishing has an
agreement to provide content. For example, if you visit us from one of the hospitals to which we
supply content, we will aggregate the data about what information you used while on the site with
other visitors from that site and supply it to the sponsoring hospital. EBSCO Publishing may also
study aggregate data from the entire EBSCO Publishing Network in order to enhance existing
services or develop new services. EBSCO Publishing will not disclose any individually
identifiable information to a third party without your express prior written authorization.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="E"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Medical Information and Minors&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing does not operate a commercial Web site or an online service directed to
children under 13 years of age. The Company does not collect personal information from
children, nor operate a general audience Web site that collects personal information. To ensure
that the Company stays in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
(COPPA), EBSCO Publishing reviews the details of COPPA on an annual basis.</p><p>EBSCO Publishing’s content and other services are not written, intended, or designed for children
under the age of 13.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="F"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Use of IP Addresses&nbsp;</h2><p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are
surfing the Web. Many Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address.</p><p>EBSCO Publishing collects IP addresses from the Web server logs for the purposes of system
administration, to report aggregate information to our clients through whose Web sites you
access EBSCO Publishing’s content, and to audit the use of our site. When users request pages
from EBSCO Publishing, our servers log the users’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP
addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user’s session will be logged,
but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when
we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect
our service, site, customers, or others.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="G"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Use of Cookies&nbsp;</h2><p>Cookies are used for record keeping and to track your movements when you visit a Web site. The
use of cookies is an industry standard - you’ll find them used at most Web sites, including healthrelated
ones.</p><p>There are two types of cookies: persistent and session. Persistent cookies are pieces of
information that a Web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
EBSCO Publishing’s Health Library platform does not use persistent cookies and, therefore, does
not place bits of computer code found with cookies on your computer. EBSCO Publishing does
utilize session cookies that enable you to navigate the content that you use during your visit.
Session cookies do not give us access to any personally identifiable information about you.</p><p>EBSCO Publishing’s Health Library platform uses session cookies with one single purpose in
mind: to help you better understand and navigate areas of the EBSCO Publishing service that our
users find valuable. While this activity depends on the use of a session cookie, visitors to EBSCO
Publishing always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser settings.</p><p>We do not control cookies from the other sites that you may link to from EBSCO Publishing.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="H"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Links to Other Sites&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing may provide links to an external Web site; these links are for information
purposes only. When you click on such a link, another window will open, signifying that you are
leaving EBSCO Publishing content. The privacy policy of the external Web site is in effect, not
EBSCO Publishing’s. Although EBSCO Publishing endeavors to make sure that the site you are
linking to is a source of accurate, relevant, and balanced information, EBSCO Publishing neither
controls nor makes an endorsement of any kind regarding the external site.</p><p>Links to external Web sites are selected based on an individual author’s assessment of: (1)
source, (2) accuracy, (3) relevance, and (4) balance. The Medical Director has final discretion as
to whether an embedded link meets these criteria. All content links undergo editorial review for
content and functionality on the same schedule as the content in which they are embedded.</p><p>EBSCO Publishing’s policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the
Internet, and therefore beyond EBSCO Publishing’s control, and is not to be applied in any
manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="I"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">E-mail addresses&nbsp;</h2><p>When you send e-mails to "Support", we reasonably expect to receive the e-mails. However, due
to the volume of questions we receive, we are unable to answer them all. The senders' e-mail
addresses sent are not stored any longer than 30 days and we do not use identifying personal
information for any other purpose although it may be included in anonymous, aggregated
statistical information. (See Aggregate Data section of Privacy Policy.)</p><p>WWhen you click on "Send to a friend" at the top of some of our pages, we will ask for your e-mail
address and the address of the person receiving the page URL and you also may add personal
comments. The e-mail address of the receiver of the page URL will not be used for any other
purpose than to send the page URL and any personal comments you added. EBSCO Publishing
does not store either your e-mail address or the address of the person receiving the page URL.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="J"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Security&nbsp;</h2><p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is
of utmost concern to us. The level of security is established by the member of the EBSCO
Publishing Network. You can determine the security status of the site by looking at the url: urls
that start with “https: “ are secure sites.</p><p>Personal information submitted by you when you are using WellMed’s Health Risk Assessment or
Personal Health Manager is transmitted to WellMed via a secure method that uses Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. At WellMed, the information is stored in a secure database
behind an electronic firewall and is password-protected. Once you have registered for access to
secure area hosted WellMed, you would have been assigned a username and password. You are
the only person who has access to this information. We recommend that you do not divulge your
password to anyone. EBSCO Publishing will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited
phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
passwords and any account information.</p><p>If you access EBSCO Publishing from a public workstation in a library or hospital, remember to
sign out and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that
others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is
accessible to others.</p><p>EBSCO Publishing cannot completely ensure the privacy of e-mail communications to and from
our site because they are not encrypted and, therefore, not secure. These communications, like
most Internet e-mail, could be intercepted without your knowledge and permission, while in transit
to or from our site. This includes e-mail you send to us through our various mailboxes, and URL
information e-mailed from our site to others using the "Send to a friend" feature. If you are
concerned about your privacy, we suggest that you do not use e-mail to communicate information
to us that you consider sensitive.</p><p>Once we have information that we may have obtained while you have visited a site on the
EBSCO Publishing Network, we store this information on database servers at the EBSCO
Publishing facilities, that are housed in Ipswich, Massachusetts. EBSCO Publishing maintains a
security presence, pass code locked doors access, and pass code authority.</p><p>Although EBSCO Publishing will make every effort to safeguard your personal information, you
should know that no site could warrant that it is 100% secure from “hackers” who might learn how
to evade security systems or intercept transmissions over the Internet.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="K"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Effect of Legal Obligations Upon EBSCO Publishing 's Privacy Policy&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to
believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
unintentionally) EBSCO Publishing’s rights or property, other EBSCO Publishing users, or anyone
else that could be harmed by such activities. EBSCO Publishing may disclose user information
when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. In the event that we are compelled to
disclose personal and/or health-related personal information, we will notify affected users, if the
law allows, before making the required disclosure.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="L"> </a><h2 class="SectionHeader">Changes in EBSCO Publishing’s Privacy Policy&nbsp;</h2><p>EBSCO Publishing will only use the information we learn about you in the manner described in
the Privacy Policy in effect when the information was collected from you. However, we reserve
the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to our site. If,
at any time, we wish to use personal information about you in a manner drastically different than
what we’ve described here, we will make every effort to contact you if you have given us your email
