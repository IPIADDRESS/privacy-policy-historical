        University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) understands that your health 
        information is personal. We create and maintain a record with information 
        about the care and services you receive at UPMC. We need this information 
        to provide you with quality care and to comply with the law. This Notice 
        of Privacy Practices (Notice) applies to all information about your care 
        that UPMC (and all of the people and places that make up UPMC) may create, 
        maintain, or receive. This includes information that UPMC receives from 
        other doctors and medical facilities that are not part of UPMC, but that 
        UPMC keeps to help give you better care. The Notice tells you about the 
        ways we may use and share your health information, as well as the legal 
        duties we have about your health information. The Notice also tells you 
        about your rights under federal (United States) and state (Pennsylvania) 
        laws. In this Notice, the words “we,” “us,” and 
        “our” mean UPMC and all the people and places that make up 
        UPMC, which are described below.</font></p>

        UPMC’s Notice of Privacy Practices?</strong><br>
        All of the people and places that make up UPMC follow this Notice. UPMC 
        includes hospitals, doctors, rehabilitation services, skilled nursing 
        services, home health services, pharmacy services, laboratory services, 
        and other related health care providers. UPMC also includes departments, 
        units, and staff within our health care facilities; health care professionals 
        permitted by us to provide services to you; and students, residents, trainees, 
        volunteers, and others involved in providing your care. UPMC people and 
        places may share your health information with each other for the treatment,

        Additionally, if your doctor is not a member of a physician practice that 
        is owned by UPMC, he or she may have different policies about how to handle 
        your information and will have a separate Notice.</font></p>

        use and share your health information with others</font></strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        The law permits us to use and share your health information in certain 
        ways. The list below tells you about different ways that we may use your 
        health information and share it with others. The list also includes some 
        examples of what we mean. When sharing this information with others outside 
        of UPMC, we share what is reasonably necessary, unless we are sharing 
        information to help treat you, in response to your written permission, 
        or as the law requires. In these three cases, we share all information 
        that you, your health care provider, or the law has asked for. We will 
        use health information that does not identify you whenever possible. Every 
        possible example of how we may use or share information is not listed 
        below; however, all of the ways we are permitted to use and share information 
        fall into one of the groups below.</font></p>

          are allowed to use and share your health information with others without

            <li><strong>Treatment.</strong> We may use your health information 
              to give you medical treatment or services. We may share your health 
              information with people and places that provide treatment to you. 
              For example, if you have diabetes, the doctor may need to tell the 
              dietitian about your diabetes so that you get the kind of meals 
              you need. We may share health information about you with people 
              outside of UPMC who provide follow-up care to you, such as nursing 
              homes and home care agencies.</li>

            <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Payment.</strong>

              we may use and share your health information with your insurance 
              company or a third party. We may also share your health information 
              with another doctor or facility that has treated you so that they 
              can bill you, your insurance company, or a third party. For example, 
              some health plans require your health information to pre-approve 
              you for surgery and require preapproval before they pay us.</font></li>

              information to review the treatment and services we gave you and 
              to see how well our staff cared for you. We may share your health 
              information with our researchers so they can develop plans to conduct 
              research. We may share information with our students, trainees, 
              and staff for review and learning purposes.</font></li>

              the confidentiality of the information. For example, we may share

              and dates that health care was provided to you. You may then be 
              asked for a donation to UPMC. For example, you may receive a letter 
              from a UPMC foundation asking for a donation to support enhanced

          Ask for an Accounting of Disclosures.</strong> You have the right to 
          ask us for an “accounting of disclosures.” This is a list 
          of those people outside of UPMC that have received your health information. 
          This right does not include information shared for treatment, payment, 
          or health care operations or when you have provided us with permission 
          to do so. You must put your request in writing and give it to your doctor 
          or the place where you received care. You can call your doctor’s 
          office or the place where you received care to find out how to ask for 
          the list. You must include in your written request how far back in time 
          you want us to go. It may not be longer than six (6) years and may not 
          include dates before April 14, 2003, which is the date by<br>
          law we are required to begin keeping track of the disclosures.</font></li></font>

          us to limit the health information we use or share with others about 
          you for treatment, payment, or health care operations. You also have 
          the right to ask us to limit health information that we share with someone 
          who is involved in your care or payment for your care, like a family 
          member or friend. You can call your doctor’s office or the place 
          where you received your care to get instructions on how to submit such 
          a request. In your request, you must tell us (1) what information you 
          want to limit, (2) whether you want to limit our use, disclosure, or 
          both, and (3) the person or institution the limits apply to (for example, 
          your spouse). For example, you could ask that we not use or share information 
          about a surgery you had. You must put your request in writing and give 
          it to your doctor or the place where you received your care. We are 
          not required to agree to your request. If we do agree to your request, 
          we will not follow your request if the information you asked us to limit 
          is needed to give you emergency treatment.</font></li></font>
