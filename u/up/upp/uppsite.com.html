<p>MySiteApp takes your privacy seriously.&nbsp; We respect and protect the privacy of our users and take appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information.<br>
We collect the information you give us when you&nbsp;visit our Web Site and use it when you request to be contacted.

We never, under any circumstances, rent or sell email addresses to any other company or individual.<br>
When coordinating with our resellers for the purpose of follow-up on sales inquiries made to us, we provide full contact information of the inquirer to the reseller, including email address, so the reseller can follow up on the inquiry.</p>
<p>Our marketing email policy and practice fully conforms to the United States Federal “CAN SPAM” act of 2003 and the applicable Israeli statues such as the Protection of Privacy Law 5741-1981. &nbsp;Note that some regions such as the European Union, have different email laws and guidelines, and MySiteApp conforms to local laws in those cases.
