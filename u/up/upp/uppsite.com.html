        <div class="text">
            <p>
                MySiteApp sends promotional email only to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customers</li>
                <li>People who have given consent to MySiteApp to receive promotional email</li>
                <li>People on rented email lists who have given permission to the list owner to receive third-party promotional email</li>
                <li>All of the abovementioned who have not opted out after having received promotional email from us.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In each promotional email, we include an easy and clear way to opt out of future MySiteApp email. Opt-out requests are submitted through <a href="mailto:Support@MySiteapp.com">Support@MySiteapp.com</a>, and such Opt-out requests are processed within 10 business days. When sending email to rented email lists, we suppress addresses of those people who have opted out of MySiteApp email in the past.<br>
                We always disclose our identity in mass email communications, including the address of our headquarters location.<br>
                We never use deceiving header information or subject lines.<br>
                We never send mass, promotional email to email addresses “harvested” from websites.<br>
                We never, under any circumstances, rent or sell email addresses to any other company or individual.<br>
                When coordinating with our resellers for the purpose of follow-up on sales inquiries made to us, we provide full contact information of the inquirer to the reseller, including email address, so the reseller can follow up on the inquiry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our marketing email policy and practice fully conforms to the United States Federal “CAN SPAM” act of 2003 and the applicable Israeli statues such as the Protection of Privacy Law 5741-1981. &nbsp;Note that some regions such as the European Union, have different email laws and guidelines, and MySiteApp conforms to local laws in those cases. We welcome and encourage your thoughts on this policy at <a href="mailto:Support@MySiteapp.com">Support@MySiteapp.com</a>.
