</p><p>For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address.</p>



<p>We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our web page. We collect, but do not share, the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board,  those who make postings to our chat areas, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>



<p>The information we collect is used only to improve the content of our Web page, our programs, and our resources. The information is not sold, traded, or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.</p>



<p>We do not send unsolicited e-mail. However, we do send e-mail newsletters to various Upper Room® e-mail listserves by request of the user. These lists are described on the following web page:  <a href="http://www.upperroom.org/mailinglists/">http://www.upperroom.org/mailinglists/</a> If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please let us know by sending e-mail to the appropriate list manager (instructions are appended at the bottom of each e-mail we send out). </p>



<p>We publish an E-Mail Edition of The Upper Room® daily devotional magazine: <a href="http://www.upperroom.org/emaildevo/">http://www.upperroom.org/emaildevo/</a>.

<font color="#333366" size="4"><b>Policies for Children (Under the Age of 13)</b></font></a><p><a name="children"></a>



</p><p>

The Upper Room encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the Pockets web site. No personally identifiable information should be submitted to or posted at The Upper Room by visitors under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

</p>



<p>

This web site does not solicit or allow children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information.  In the event that we ask for information from children under the age of 13, we do not include personally identifiable information such as child's last name, city, or e-mail address.

</p>



<p>

If our Upper Room staff receive e-mail from children under 13, we may contact the child under the following circumstances:<br>

</p><ul>

	<b>a)</b> to respond directly to the child's request on a one-time basis to a specific request from the child where it is not used to re-contact the child for other purposes, <p>

	<b>b)</b> in order to request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification, and </p><p>

	<b>c)</b> to respond more than once directly to a specific request from the child and not used to re-contact the child  beyond the scope of that request (such as the case where a child requests a newsletter subscription).  Where the information is used to contact the child more than once, The Upper Room uses reasonable efforts to provide parental notification. </p><p>

</p></ul>
