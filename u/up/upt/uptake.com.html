	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><div class="para"><h2>Data You Provide Us</h2>
<h4>Registration Data.</h4>
<p>When you register, you provide www.uptake.com with some personal data (including your first name, last name and email address). Occasionally, a co-brand partner or other vendor may provide us with your registration data. You can also tell us more about yourself through your account pages or elsewhere, and we may give you choices about whether or not to publish this data to everyone, your friends, or just yourself. We use registration data for many purposes, including to improve the site, generate reports of aggregated activity that we share with others our business partners, potential partners, investors, and contractors, or to send emails to you. Typically, you can turn our emails on and off from a link in the email, but some administrative emails (such as emails about user agreement changes) are mandatory while you have an account. If you do not want to have emails sent to you do not create an account, or delete the one you have created. If you do not create an account you will still be able use most of the features of the site.</p>
<p>If you register through a co-branded site, we might share your registration data with the co-brand partner, in which case your data is governed by that entity's privacy policies, not ours. If you do not wish to have your data shared in the manner described above, simply do not register for an account or provide us with personal information, if you do not register you can still use most of the site functionality.</p>
<h4>Interest in Third Party Offerings.</h4>
<p>You may have opportunities to express interest in, or register for, third parties' offerings. If you do, we will follow your instructions about providing your data to the third party (and we might retain the data as well).</p>
