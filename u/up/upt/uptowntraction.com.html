<br>
<strong>Personal Data </strong>Personal Data is information that is associated with an individual and enables that individual User to be singled out. Through the use of ad tags and cookies we collect information about you. Typically, the information obtained does not identify you directly (i.e. by name or email address), however, the information may indirectly identify your device or geolocate you for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements. Under European privacy law, some information transmitted by Cookies and Tags including Log Data are considered personal information.
