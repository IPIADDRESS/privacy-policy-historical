      <p><font face="Arial">Info Products Sites, the provider of Maintenance 
      Resources (the "Services"), has created this Privacy Policy to explain our 
      information-gathering and dissemination practices. Your use of our 
      Services confirms your acknowledgement and acceptance of the terms of this 
      Privacy Policy.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">I. What information we do and do not  
      collect</font></h3>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">- Personally Identifiable Information</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We only obtain and retain personally identifiable 
      information that you give to us and certain related transactional 
      information which we collect based on your use of our Services. For 
      example, you might supply your name and email address by contacting us or 
      placing an order on line or by telephone </font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">- Non-Personally Identifiable Information</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">When you visit our Services, we do not collect data 
      about who you are or any other personally identifiable information except 
      as described above. We do, however, collect certain non-personally 
      identifiable information about you based upon your activity on our 
      website. We may collect machine data such as processor type, processor 
      speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, 
      and video cards. This information may include the Web site's Uniform 
      Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go 
      to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">- Cookies</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Cookies are small data files that are sent from our 
      servers to your computer during a browsing session. In order to make our 
      Service more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may use cookies 
      to assign your Internet browser a unique random number, a sort of 
      anonymous user ID that is stored in a file on your computer. By using a 
      cookie, we are able to automatically identify your browser and track your 
      use of our Service and our web pages. Most web browsers automatically 
      accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the 
      acceptance of cookies if you prefer. You can also delete cookie files from 
      your computer after they have been stored.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We use third-party advertising companies to serve 
      ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about 
      your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements 
      about goods and services of interest to you. For example, Google, as a 
      third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads to our Service, and those 
      ads place cookies on your computer. However, those cookies do not reveal 
      any of your personally identifiable information. Google provides 
      information about their advertising and privacy, including how to opt out 
      of the use of their
      <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" target="_blank">DART 
      cookie</a> at the
      <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google ad 
      and content network privacy policy</a>.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">- Children's Information</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy 
      Protection Act and fair information practices, we do not intentionally 
      collect any personally identifiable information from children.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">II. How do we use the information we collect?</font></h3>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">- Personally Identifiable Information</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We may use your email address to contact you 
      regarding account issues and as a way of letting you know about new 
      features of our Service.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We do not sell, rent, loan, or otherwise share 
      personally identifiable information, including email lists, with third 
      parties.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We may be required by law, court order, governmental 
      agency, or law enforcement authority to disclose whatever personally 
      identifiable information we may have collected from you. We may also 
      disclose your information to law enforcement authorities investigating 
      suspected illegal activity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We do not combine personally identifiable 
      information with any of the non-personally identifiable information 
      gathered through the use of cookies.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">- Non-Personally Identifiable Information</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We compile and analyze non-personally identifiable 
      information on an aggregated basis. For example, we may know that ninety 
      people visited this Privacy Policy yesterday or how long the average 
      visitor spent using our Services last month. But we do not link this 
      information with any of the personally identifiable information that we 
      collect from you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We may also use this non-personally identifiable 
      information to conduct internal research on our visitors' demographics, 
      interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our visitors.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We also pass the aggregated data (but not your 
      personally identifiable information) to advertising agencies and firms 
      that conduct site analysis, such as Google Analytics, in order to help 
      such companies feed advertising to our Services in the most efficient 
      manner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We do not restrict the recipients of any 
      non-personally identifiable information from using that information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We do not monitor third party use of the information 
      we share with them. However, none of that information can be used by third 
      parties to identify you.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">III. How long do we retain the information we 
      collect from you?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We retain your Maintenance Resources account 
      information and the aggregated non-personally identifiable information we 
      collect from you indefinitely. </font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">IV. Can you request that we purge from our 
      system the information we collect from you?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We do not currently have any procedure by which 
      users can request that we purge the information we collect from them. 
      However, the only personally identifiable information we collect is the 
      Maintenance Resources account information. You may change (or delete) your 
      Maintenance Resources account information at any time, although in doing 
      so it does not necessarily mean that the original account information will 
      be deleted from our servers.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">V. What measures do we take to protect the 
      security of the information you submit?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Our website, and all of the data related to the 
      Services, reside on servers maintained by a commercial hosting company. 
      That company takes certain precautions to protect the servers from 
      intrusion, including securing the facilities in which the servers are 
      located and maintaining a firewall to protect against unauthorized access. 
      None of these measures is foolproof; and we do not monitor the web hosting 
      company's facilities or procedures to determine its compliance with the 
      security procedures it says it employs.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">VI. How will you know of changes to this 
      Privacy Policy?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy 
      to comply with applicable laws, to improve your experience, or to reflect 
      any general change in our policy. Any changes we make to this Privacy 
      Policy will be posted to this web page. We will not send you messages 
      informing you of these changes, so you are responsible for checking this 
      web page frequently. You are encouraged to print or download a copy of 
      this document for your permanent records.</font></p>
      <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">VII. How can you contact us if you have any 
      questions?</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy 
      or our practices or procedures with regard to personally identifiable 
      information, you should contact us at
