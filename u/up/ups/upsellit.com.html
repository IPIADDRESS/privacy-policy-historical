    <pre>    <h1>UpSellit Privacy Policy</h1>

    We are committed to protecting your privacy. Please review this document before you go further in your visit on our site or before you
    use any of our tools or services.

    UpSellit provides abandonment tools to website owners who want to interact with visitors on their website. Part of the service enhances
    the website owner's understanding of who is on their website and reports to them that information. Naturally, we use our products,
    so what you read below applies to visitors to our website as well.

    We use "Cookies." Our cookies are designed to help us and our customers provide better service to visitors on our websites by recognizing
    a returning visitor and noting that in our reporting. A session "Cookie" is written to a visitor's browser for the purpose of maintaining
    an understanding of that visitor during the current visit and on any subsequent visit. Any visitor on a website may turn off "Cookies" by
    adjusting the appropriate setting on their browser. Please note, if a visitor turns off cookies the visitor and/or the website owner may
    find some of the functionality of the UpSellit's products, to be reduced or impaired.

    Just like a brick and mortar business pays attention to people in its store, so do we. We use (and provide to our customers) code that
    helps us "see" who visited our store and what parts of our store they looked at. Providing such data to our customers is an inherent part
    of the service we provide. In addition to visit-related information, on behalf of our customers we may provide and store chat, email and
    contact information so our customers may be able to better provide aid to visitors to their websites for the products and/or services our
    customers offer. We may aggregate and analyze non-personal tracking data to better understand customer behavior and may share aggregated
    data with our customers to help our customers serve their customers more effectively.

    If a visitor to our website or our customers' website(s) decides to interact with the website using our products, the visitor may be asked
    for identifying information including their name, phone number, and other pertinent information. We store that information as well as the
    transcript of the chat (if one occurs) on behalf of our customers.

    In order to create an account or user login to use our service or access certain documents or portions of our website, you may be required
    to complete online registration forms that provide us with contact information such as your name and street address, your email address,
    and your phone numbers. In order to seek out and repair functionality issues with our servers and related programming, we may use your email
    and IP addresses for evaluation and diagnostic purposes. We may also use your email and IP address to automatically recognize you should you
    contact us or use our tools and services. Groups of email and IP addresses are also gathered so that we may have broad demographic information.

    If you provide us your email address for any reason, we may, from time to time, send you emails regarding our service so that we can directly
    communicate with you regarding issues we determine to be relevant. <span style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold;">Please note that any data you provide on this website may be
    saved, even if you do not click [submit/next]. Information provided may be used to contact you about our services.
    We may also provide you with promotional information about our tools and services.</span> An opt-out procedure is provided with
    each mailing regarding general offers or information. You must accept emails from us that deal with specific issues regarding your account or
    membership. This is because we may need to contact you if there is a change in the service that we are providing you or if we need to respond
    to an inquiry that you have sent us regarding a customer service issue or other important concern.

    Naturally, should you purchase a product or service from us, we will require sufficient information from you so that we can complete the transaction.
    Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required
    for processing the order. We will also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as
    monthly or other types of periodic payments. All information of this nature is maintained by us in a secure database and transmitted across the Internet
    from you to us using secured transmission encryption.

    We protect our customers' data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction on secure servers and utilize unique usernames with
    required passwords to ensure our customers only view their own data.

    We will never reveal any information you provided us nor information in your commercial use of our services as described above to any third party or
    entity for any reason except under the following circumstances:

    If a governmental agency, or court, subpoenas your private information, or makes a formal request for discovery pursuant to any legal action, or
    pending legal action.


    If our attorney requests such information relevant to a current or pending legal matter in which you are a potential or actual party or otherwise
    contributed in some way to the causation of the legal matter. Please contact us here if you should have any questions, comments or concerns about
    this Privacy Policy.
