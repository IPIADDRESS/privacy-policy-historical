      What information we share with third parties
    </div>
    All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business.  We may share your personal information with:
    <ul>
      <li><p>Service providers who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services, and financial institutions that we partner with to offer a product.  Our contracts dictate that these third parties only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit</p></li>
      <li><p>Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.</p></li>
      <li><p>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. </p></li>
      <li><p>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when (1) we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, (2) we need to do so to comply with law, or (3) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p></li>
      <li><p>Other third parties but only if you consent or direct us to do so.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Upstart will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described above.
    <br><br>
    Information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user is not considered personal information.  Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances such as sharing your information so that third parties can market to you. However, because we will not share your information in these instances, there is no need for you to opt-out from the information we share.
