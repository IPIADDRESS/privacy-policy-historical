</li><li>Other personal information that may be provided to us to obtain a UPS product or service</li></ul><br>When we pick up or deliver a shipment or provide other services, we may obtain physical location data. This includes, for example, data identifying the actual location of a physical address using information such as GPS data, geocodes, latitude and longitude information, and images of the various locations. 
<br><br>
In addition, when you visit our websites, use our apps, or interact with UPS-related tools, widgets or plug-ins, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier,&nbsp; browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken, and dates and times of activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages or apps to web servers and may be used to transmit information back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain and store "clickstream data" to tell us usage patterns.&nbsp; We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. We also may use third-party analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites or apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our websites or apps.&nbsp; Both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors' online activities, over time and across third-party websites, when using our websites and apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our websites and apps, such as Facebook "Like" buttons, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features.&nbsp; This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers.&nbsp; <br></td>

We also may share the personal information we obtain with our affiliates,

physical location data with our UPS Business Partners and other third parties 
to, for example, enhance location-based services and develop accurate and

may share other personal information with third parties who are not UPS Business

Information collected through third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins (such as information obtained through third-party login services or relating to your use of a Facebook "Like" button) is collected directly by the providers of these features.

Many of our customers outsource all or a part of their supply chains to us. 
Through our forwarding and logistics business units, we manage these supply 
chains, focusing on supply chain optimization, freight forwarding, and 
international trade and brokerage services for our customers worldwide 
(including a broad range of transportation solutions such as air, ocean and 
ground freight). We also provide information technology systems and distribution 
facilities adapted to the unique supply chains of specific industries such as 
health care, technology and consumer/retail businesses. In the course of 
providing forwarding and logistics services, we may obtain, use and disclose 
personal information about our customers' customers. In these circumstances, we 
process the information based on the agreement with our customer.<br><br>
We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by 
law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in 
response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement 
authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to 
prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation 
of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer any 
information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion 
of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, 
dissolution or liquidation).</td>
