<br>
You may opt out of the UPside Loyalty Program at any time through the UPside Card websites. <br>
<br>

You may choose to visit the UPSide Mall pages of this website either after having logged in as a registered user or simply as a visitor, i.e. without having entered a username and password. If you visit the UPside Mall as a visitor and choose to click on one of the product or merchant links, your action of clicking will be registered anonymously, i.e. without personally identifiable information, by both our servers and the destination merchant’s servers, for the sole purpose of determining if such selection later results in a purchase by you, and therefore determine the efficiency of the UPside Mall in driving traffic towards its merchants.</div>
<div align="left">If you visit the UPside Mall after having logged in and choose to click on one of the product or merchant links, your action will be registered by our servers as related to you as an individual user, whereas your action will be recorded anonymously without personally identifiable information by the destination merchant.</div>

<br>
<u>Participation in Surveys or Contests</u> <br>
<br>
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information (e.g. zip code) <br>
<br>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes to participants to monitor site traffic, and to personalize the site to best fit the needs of our customers.</div>
<div align="left">We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is/will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior written notice and choice. <br>
<br>
<u>Tell-A-Friend</u> <br>
<br>
If you choose to use our automated email-based referal service available on the initial pre-registration page of the UPside Card websites to tell a friend about the UPside Cards, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Plastyc stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. <br>
<br>
Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://www.upsidecard.com">www.upsidecard.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. <br>
<br>
<u>Sponsor-A-Friend</u> <br>
<br>
If you choose to use our automated email-based sponsoring service available post-registration from your main account page of the UPside Card websites to invite a friend to apply for an UPside Card, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to enroll for an UPside Card and we will keep track of whether or not your friend as accepted the offer, in order to grant you certain reward if they do accept.</div>
<div align="left">We may keep your friends’ name and email address during a reasonable period of time in order to be able to remind them from time to time about your sponsored invitation. <br>
<br>
Your friend may contact us at any time through the UPside Card websites to request that we remove his or her information from our database and stop sending him or her any further email beyond the confirmation of the removal. <br>
<br>
<u>Navigating the UPside Card Websites</u> <br>
<br>
Plastyc uses information provided by you to customize your user experience while you are using the UPside Card websites, to display information about your transactions and provide account information such as balance, payment history, parties to transactions and card usage. <br>
<br>
As is true with most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to track returning users to our site. <br>
<br>
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
We use a third party tracking service (NAME) that uses cookies/log files to track non- personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, e.g. usage and volume statistics to analyze trends, to administer this site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. <br>
<br>
<u>Supplementation of Information</u> <br>
<br>
In order to provide certain services to you we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us via the UPside Card websites with information from third party sources.<br>
For example:<br>
- Allowing you to enroll for an UPside Card requires that we obtain from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) a confirmation that you are not listed as a Specially Designated National.<br>
- Allowing you to verify your history of payment transactions online via the upsidecard.com website, and to be granted loyalty points, requires that we gather card usage and reloads information from the Visa-certified transaction processor connected to MetaBank, the card issuer.<br>
- Allowing you to reload UPside Cards from a checking account via an UPside Card Website requires that we obtain from your bank the routing details necessary to organize such transfers. <br>
<br>
We may also purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers which we think you would be interested in. To enrich our Profiles of individual customers, we tie that information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us. <br>
<br>
<a id="3"></a><strong>5. CHOICE OPT-IN/OPT-OUT</strong> <br>
<br>
We provide you the opportunity to “opt-in” to certain optional services making use of personally identifiable information which we may ask you as part of the opt-in process, such as, by way of example, the UPside Loyalty Program offering the combination of a loyalty reward program and product promotions and recommendations.</div>
<div align="left">Such services are opted into entirely on a voluntary basis. <br>
<br>
We also provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, you register for a Card but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our application form. <br>
<br>
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. <br>
<br>
You will be notified when any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party collects your personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<strong>6. COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE UPSIDE CARD WEBSITES</strong> <br>
