<strong>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION &amp; USE</strong><br>
<br>
<u>Registration</u><br>
<br>
In order to use a large section of this Web Site, you must first complete an online registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.<br>
<br>
You have the option to provide demographic information such as gender to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site.<br>
<br>
<u>Application for a Card</u><br>
<br>
If you apply for an UPside Card on our site, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, date of birth, bank account information and/or credit card information and Social Security Number. This information is necessary to process your application and contact you, as well as comply with the USA Patriot Act with respect to the issuance of financial instruments.</div>

<div align="left">As part of the card application process, part of the information you supply to us is transmitted to one of the 3 major US Credit Bureaus, Experian, Equifax or TransUnion solely for the purpose of verifying the consistency of your identity, Social Security Number and address. We do not seek any information pertaining to your credit record from such bureaus. We do not retain any copy of your Social Security Number after such verification.<br>
<br>
Further storage and management of the card application information is governed by <a class="js-go-ch1" href="#" onclick="displayChapter('cl1', 'd1');window.scrollTo(0); return false;">MetaBank Privacy Policy</a>, as MetaBank is the issuer of the cards.<br>
<br>
<u>Participation in the Loyalty Program</u><br>
<br>
Once your application for an UPside Card is successfully approved, you may opt to become a member of the UPside Loyalty Program, allowing you to be granted loyalty points exchangeable for certain rewards, and allowing you to receive special product recommendations and offers from third-party merchants or service providers having partnered with Plastyc to this effect.</div>

<div align="left">During the Loyalty Program opt-in process, we may ask you non-personally identifiable lifestyle information such as preferred music genres, favorite sports, or preferred brands of products. We will use card usage information such as the frequency and amounts of monetary reloads in the card to determine how many loyalty points you may receive.<br>
<br>
We will use certain non-personally identifiable information such as zip code, or lifestyle information provided by you during the UPside Loyalty Program opt-in process, to direct product recommendations and offers from third-party merchants to your online account.<br>
<br>
No personally identifiable information will be passed along by Plastyc to any third-party merchant as part of the UPside Loyalty Program services. Only if you (a) choose voluntarily to accept a product recommendation or offer, and (b) decide to contact the merchant having originated the recommendation or offer, or (c) decide to redeem some of your points with certain merchant, will any personally identifiable information be possibly accessible to such merchant.<br>
<br>
You may opt out of the Loyalty Program at any time through the UPside Card websites.<br>
<br>
<u>Participation in photo deposit of checks</u><br>
<br>
Once your application for an UPside Card is successfully approved, you may opt to become a member of the Ingo service, allowing you to load the amount of certain paper checks issued to you into your card account. You will have to agree to the Terms and Conditions of Ingomoney, the provider of the Ingo service, prior to using this service.<br>
During the photo depositing of a paper check, your choice of obtaining your funds in minutes or waiting a few days for the check to clear, will be recorded, as well as your decision to approve or decline the fee relative to the service.<br>
<br>
We may share non-personally identifiable information such as the frequency and amounts of photo deposits of checks, the percentage of "funds in minutes" versus of "funds in days" that you have chosen and the percentage of instances when you have declined the fees, strictly for research purposes and only to non-commercial third parties. Such information will never be used for marketing purposes.<br>
<br>
<u>Participation in Surveys or Contests</u><br>
<br>
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information (e.g. zip code)<br>
<br>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes to participants to monitor site traffic, and to personalize the site to best fit the needs of our customers.</div>

<div align="left">We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is/will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior written notice and choice.<br>
<br>
<u>Tell-A-Friend</u><br>
<br>
If you choose to use our automated email-based referal service available on the initial pre-registration page of the UPside Card websites to tell a friend about the UPside Cards, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Plastyc stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.<br>
<br>
Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://www.upsidecard.com">www.upsidecard.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.<br>
<br>
<u>Sponsor-A-Friend</u><br>
<br>
If you choose to use our automated email-based sponsoring service available post-registration from your main account page of the UPside Card websites to invite a friend to apply for an UPside Card, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to enroll for an UPside Card and we will keep track of whether or not your friend as accepted the offer, in order to grant you certain reward if they do accept.</div>

<div align="left">We may keep your friends’ name and email address during a reasonable period of time in order to be able to remind them from time to time about your sponsored invitation.<br>
<br>
Your friend may contact us at any time through the UPside Card websites to request that we remove his or her information from our database and stop sending him or her any further email beyond the confirmation of the removal.<br>
<br>
<u>Navigating the UPside Card Websites</u><br>
<br>
Plastyc uses information provided by you to customize your user experience while you are using the UPside Card websites, to display information about your transactions and provide account information such as balance, payment history, parties to transactions and card usage.<br>
<br>
As is true with most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to track returning users to our site.<br>
<br>
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
We may use from time to time third party tracking services such as Quantcast that use cookies/log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, e.g. usage and volume statistics to analyze trends, to administer this site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.<br>
<br>
<u>Supplementation of Information</u><br>
<br>
In order to provide certain services to you we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us via the UPside Card websites with information from third party sources.<br>
For example:
<ul>
	<li>Allowing you to enroll for an UPside Card requires that we obtain from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) a confirmation that you are not listed as a Specially Designated National.</li>
	<li>Allowing you to verify your history of payment transactions online via the upsidecard.com website, and to be granted loyalty points, requires that we gather card usage and reloads information from the Visa-certified transaction processor connected to MetaBank, the card issuer.</li>
	<li>Allowing you to reload UPside Cards from a checking account via an UPside Card Website requires that we obtain from your bank the routing details necessary to organize such transfers.</li>
</ul>
- Allowing you to enroll for an UPside Card requires that we obtain from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) a confirmation that you are not listed as a Specially Designated National.<br>
- Allowing you to verify your history of payment transactions online via the upsidecard.com website, and to be granted loyalty points, requires that we gather card usage and reloads information from the Visa-certified transaction processor connected to MetaBank, the card issuer.<br>
- Allowing you to fund your prepaid account from a checking account via the UPside Card Website requires that we obtain from your bank the routing details necessary to organize such transfers.<br>
<br>
We may also purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers which we think you would be interested in. To enrich our Profiles of individual customers, we tie that information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.<br>
<br>
<a name="3"></a> <strong>3. CHOICE OPT-IN/OPT-OUT</strong><br>
<br>
We provide you the opportunity to “opt-in” to certain optional services making use of personally identifiable information which we may ask you as part of the opt-in process, such as, by way of example, the UPside Loyalty Program offering the combination of a loyalty reward program and product promotions and recommendations.</div>
