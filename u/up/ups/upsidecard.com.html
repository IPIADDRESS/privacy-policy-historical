<strong>1. The Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> <br>
<br>
The Children Online Privacy Protection Act, effective April 21, 2000 applies to the online collection of personally identifiable information and aggregate information from children under 13. We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under 13. We have made it a policy at Plastyc to not accept any applications or communications from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect information from children we are not required by law to comply with COPPA, but we do choose to adhere to its principles. We are not responsible for the data collection and practices of nonaffiliated third parties that may be linked to/from our Web site, with respect to COPPA compliance. <br>
<br>
We recognize that protecting children’s identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents. While Plastyc works to protect your personal information, you also have responsibility. <br>
<br>
<strong>2. INTERNET SAFETY For CHILDREN</strong> <br>
<br>
The Internet is a public network. Children’s access to the Internet can allow them to visit inappropriate Web sites and be exposed to unwanted risks. Parents can be proactive by installing filtering software that gives them more control over their family’s Internet experience. Learn more about COPPA at <a href="http://www.coppa.org">www.coppa.org</a> and on the Federal Trade Commission’s Web Site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a>. <br>

<strong>4. INFORMATION COLLECTION &amp; USE</strong> <br>
<br>
<u>Registration</u> <br>
<br>
In order to use a large section of this Web Site, you must first complete an online registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. <br>
<br>
You have the option to provide demographic information such as gender to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. <br>
<br>
<u>Application for a Card</u> <br>
<br>
If you apply for an UPside Card on our site, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, date of birth, bank account information and/or credit card information and Social Security Number. This information is necessary to process your application and contact you, as well as comply with the USA Patriot Act with respect to the issuance of financial instruments.</div>
<div align="left">As part of the card application process, part of the information you supply to us is transmitted to one of the 3 major US Credit Bureaus, Experian, Equifax or TransUnion solely for the purpose of verifying the consistency of your identity, Social Security Number and address. We do not seek any information pertaining to your credit record from such bureaus. <br>
<br>
Further storage and management of the card application information is governed by <a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/fckeditor/editor/fckeditor.html?InstanceName=FCKeditor1&amp;Toolbar=Default#1">MetaBank Privacy Policy</a>, as MetaBank is the issuer of the cards. <br>
<br>
<u>Participation in the UPside Loyalty Program</u> <br>
<br>
Once your application for an UPside Card is successfully approved, you may opt to become a member of the UPside Loyalty Program, allowing you to be granted loyalty points exchangeable for certain rewards, and allowing you to receive special product recommendations and offers from third-party merchants or service providers having partnered with Plastyc to this effect.</div>
<div align="left">During the UPside Loyalty Program opt-in process, we may ask you non-personally identifiable lifestyle information such as preferred music genres, favorite sports, or preferred brands of products. We will use card usage information such as the frequency and amounts of monetary reloads in the card to determine how many loyalty points you may receive. <br>
<br>
We will use certain non-personally identifiable information such as zip code, or lifestyle information provided by you during the UPside Loyalty Program opt-in process, to direct product recommendations and offers from third-party merchants to your online account. <br>
<br>
No personally identifiable information will be passed along by Plastyc to any third-party merchant as part of the UPside Loyalty Program services. Only if you (a) choose voluntarily to accept a product recommendation or offer, and (b) decide to contact the merchant having originated the recommendation or offer, or (c) decide to redeem some of your points with certain merchant, will any personally identifiable information be possibly accessible to such merchant. <br>
<br>
You may opt out of the UPside Loyalty Program at any time through the UPside Card websites. <br>
<br>
<u>Visits to the UPside Mall</u> <br>
<br>
You may choose to visit the UPSide Mall pages of this website either after having logged in as a registered user or simply as a visitor, i.e. without having entered a username and password. If you visit the UPside Mall as a visitor and choose to click on one of the product or merchant links, your action of clicking will be registered anonymously, i.e. without personally identifiable information, by both our servers and the destination merchant’s servers, for the sole purpose of determining if such selection later results in a purchase by you, and therefore determine the efficiency of the UPside Mall in driving traffic towards its merchants.</div>
<div align="left">If you visit the UPside Mall after having logged in and choose to click on one of the product or merchant links, your action will be registered by our servers as related to you as an individual user, whereas your action will be recorded anonymously without personally identifiable information by the destination merchant.</div>
<div align="left">&nbsp;</div>
<div align="left">We record your action for the sole purpose of being able to grant you loyalty points, should your action be followed up by a purchase by you from the merchant. Such information will not be shared or sold to any third party. <br>
<br>
<u>Participation in Surveys or Contests</u> <br>
<br>
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information (e.g. zip code) <br>
<br>
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes to participants to monitor site traffic, and to personalize the site to best fit the needs of our customers.</div>
<div align="left">We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is/will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior written notice and choice. <br>
<br>
<u>Tell-A-Friend</u> <br>
<br>
If you choose to use our automated email-based referal service available on the initial pre-registration page of the UPside Card websites to tell a friend about the UPside Cards, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Plastyc stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. <br>
<br>
Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://www.upsidecard.com">www.upsidecard.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. <br>
<br>
<u>Sponsor-A-Friend</u> <br>
<br>
If you choose to use our automated email-based sponsoring service available post-registration from your main account page of the UPside Card websites to invite a friend to apply for an UPside Card, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to enroll for an UPside Card and we will keep track of whether or not your friend as accepted the offer, in order to grant you certain reward if they do accept.</div>
<div align="left">We may keep your friends’ name and email address during a reasonable period of time in order to be able to remind them from time to time about your sponsored invitation. <br>
<br>
Your friend may contact us at any time through the UPside Card websites to request that we remove his or her information from our database and stop sending him or her any further email beyond the confirmation of the removal. <br>
<br>
<u>Navigating the UPside Card Websites</u> <br>
<br>
Plastyc uses information provided by you to customize your user experience while you are using the UPside Card websites, to display information about your transactions and provide account information such as balance, payment history, parties to transactions and card usage. <br>
<br>
As is true with most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to track returning users to our site. <br>
<br>
We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
We use a third party tracking service (NAME) that uses cookies/log files to track non- personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, e.g. usage and volume statistics to analyze trends, to administer this site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. <br>
<br>
<u>Supplementation of Information</u> <br>
<br>
In order to provide certain services to you we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us via the UPside Card websites with information from third party sources.<br>
For example:<br>
- Allowing you to enroll for an UPside Card requires that we obtain from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) a confirmation that you are not listed as a Specially Designated National.<br>
- Allowing you to verify your history of payment transactions online via the upsidecard.com website, and to be granted loyalty points, requires that we gather card usage and reloads information from the Visa-certified transaction processor connected to MetaBank, the card issuer.<br>
- Allowing you to reload UPside Cards from a checking account via an UPside Card Website requires that we obtain from your bank the routing details necessary to organize such transfers. <br>
<br>
We may also purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers which we think you would be interested in. To enrich our Profiles of individual customers, we tie that information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us. <br>
<br>
<a id="3"></a><strong>5. CHOICE OPT-IN/OPT-OUT</strong> <br>
<br>
We provide you the opportunity to “opt-in” to certain optional services making use of personally identifiable information which we may ask you as part of the opt-in process, such as, by way of example, the UPside Loyalty Program offering the combination of a loyalty reward program and product promotions and recommendations.</div>
<div align="left">Such services are opted into entirely on a voluntary basis. <br>
<br>
We also provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, you register for a Card but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our application form. <br>
<br>
If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. <br>
<br>
You will be notified when any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party collects your personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
