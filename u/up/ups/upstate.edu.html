Upstate recognizes that individuals and businesses need to be confident that their privacy is protected when visiting Upstate's Web sites. Most Web sites can be visited without providing any information about your visit, however sometimes Upstate needs information to provide services requested. This policy explains Upstate's practices.
</p><p>Consistent with the provisions of New York State's <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?cl=114&amp;a=3">Internet Privacy and Security Act</a>, the <a href="http://www.assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?cl=94&amp;a=8">Freedom of Information Law</a>, and the <a href="http://www.assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?cl=94&amp;a=9">Personal Privacy Protection Law</a>, this policy describes Upstate's privacy practices regarding information collected from <i><i>user</i>s</i> of this Web site and how the information is used. Because this privacy policy only applies to Upstate's Web sites, <i><i>user</i>s</i> should examine the privacy policy of any Web site, including other linked Web sites and <i>state agency Web sites</i>, that may be accessed using Upstate's Web sites.</p>
<p><b>SUNY Upstate Medical University does not collect any <i>personal information</i> about a visit unless that information is provided voluntarily by sending an e-mail, responding to a survey, or completing an on-line transaction.</b></p>

</li><li>The Web page from which the <i><i>user</i></i> accessed the current Web page;
</li><li>The date and time of the <i><i>user</i>'s</i> request; and
</li><li> The pages that were visited and the amount of time spent at each page
</li></ul>None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute <i><i>personal information</i></i> by the New York State <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?cl=114&amp;a=3">Internet Privacy and Security Act</a>. The information that is collected automatically is used to improve Upstate's Web site content and to understand how <i><i>user</i>s</i> are interacting with Upstate's Web sites.

The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and Upstate is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose information collected from Web sites for commercial marketing purposes.
<h5>Information Collected When E-mailing or Completing a Transaction</h5>
<p>During a visit to Upstate's Web sites, there may be a need to send an e-mail to Upstate. The e-mail address and contents of a message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats included in the message. The e-mail address and the information included in a message may be used to respond to a request, to address issues identified, to improve Upstate's Web sites, or to forward a message to another department or State agency for appropriate action. An e-mail address is not collected for commercial purposes and Upstate is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose e-mail addresses for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>During a visit to Upstate's Web sites a transaction may also be completed, such as a survey, registration, or order form. The information, including <i>personal information</i>, volunteered in completing a transaction is used to operate Institutional programs, which include the provision of goods, services, and information. The information collected may be disclosed by Upstate for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in which the information was submitted.</p>
<p>Upstate does not knowingly collect <i>personal information</i> from children or create profiles of children through Upstate's Web sites. <i><i>User</i>s</i> are cautioned, however, that the collection of <i>personal information</i> submitted in an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by Federal or State law, be subject to public access.
