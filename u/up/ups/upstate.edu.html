    <!--startprint--><h1>Upstate Medical University Privacy Policy</h1>
<strong>Commitment to Privacy</strong><p>SUNY Upstate Medical University (Upstate) is committed to protecting your privacy and making it easier and more efficient for individuals and businesses to interact with Upstate. Upstate recognizes that individuals and businesses need to be confident that their privacy is protected when visiting Upstate's Web sites. Most Web sites can be visited without providing any information about your visit, however sometimes Upstate needs information to provide services requested. This policy explains Upstate's practices.
</p>
<p>Consistent with the provisions of New York State's Internet Privacy and Security Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law, this policy describes Upstate's privacy practices regarding information collected from <em><em>user</em>s</em> of this Web site and how the information is used. Because this privacy policy only applies to Upstate's Web sites, <em><em>user</em>s</em> should examine the privacy policy of any Web site, including other linked Web sites and <em>state agency Web sites</em>, that may be accessed using Upstate's Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>SUNY Upstate Medical University does not collect any <em>personal information</em> about a visit unless that information is provided voluntarily by sending an e-mail, responding to a survey, or completing an on-line transaction.</strong></p>
<h5>Information Collected Automatically When Visiting Upstate's Web Sites</h5>
<p>Upstate is able to collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet Protocol address of the computer that accessed Upstate's Web sites;</li>
<li> The type of browser, its version and the operating system on which that browser is running; </li>
<li>The Web page from which the <em><em>user</em></em> accessed the current Web page;</li>
<li>The date and time of the <em><em>user</em>'s</em> request; and</li>
<li> The pages that were visited and the amount of time spent at each page</li>
</ul>None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute <em><em>personal information</em></em> by the New York State Internet Privacy and Security Act. The information that is collected automatically is used to improve Upstate's Web site content and to understand how <em><em>user</em>s</em> are interacting with Upstate's Web sites. This information is collected for statistical analysis and to determine what information is of most and least interest to Upstate's <em><em>user</em>s</em>. The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and Upstate is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose information collected from Web sites for commercial marketing purposes.
<h5>Information Collected When E-mailing or Completing a Transaction</h5>
<p>During a visit to Upstate's Web sites, there may be a need to send an e-mail to Upstate. The e-mail address and contents of a message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats included in the message. The e-mail address and the information included in a message may be used to respond to a request, to address issues identified, to improve Upstate's Web sites, or to forward a message to another department or State agency for appropriate action. An e-mail address is not collected for commercial purposes and Upstate is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose e-mail addresses for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>During a visit to Upstate's Web sites a transaction may also be completed, such as a survey, registration, or order form. The information, including <em>personal information</em>, volunteered in completing a transaction is used to operate Institutional programs, which include the provision of goods, services, and information. The information collected may be disclosed by Upstate for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in which the information was submitted.</p>
<p>Upstate does not knowingly collect <em>personal information</em> from children or create profiles of children through Upstate's Web sites. <em><em>User</em>s</em> are cautioned, however, that the collection of <em>personal information</em> submitted in an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by Federal or State law, be subject to public access. Upstate strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide <em>personal information</em> on-line.</p>
<h5>Information and Choice</h5>
<p>As noted above, Upstate does not collect any <em>personal information</em> about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail, responding to a survey, or completing an on-line form. You may choose not to send Upstate an e-mail, respond to a survey, or complete an on-line form. While your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific services or products through this Web site, it will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of the Web site, including browsing or downloading information.</p>
<h5>Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Web Site</h5>
<p>The collection of information through Upstate's Web sites and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the New York State Internet Privacy and Security Act. Upstate will only collect <em>personal information</em> through Upstate's Web sites or disclose <em>personal information</em> collected through Upstate's Web sites if the <em>user</em> has consented to the collection or disclosure of such <em>personal information</em>. The voluntary disclosure of <em>personal information</em> to Upstate by the <em>user</em>, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by Upstate for the purposes for which the <em>user</em> disclosed the information to Upstate.</p>
<p>However, Upstate may collect or disclose <em>personal information</em> without consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of Upstate, or necessary for Upstate to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the <em>user</em>; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.</p>
<p>Further, the disclosure of information, including <em>personal information</em>, collected through Upstate's Web sites is subject to the provisions of the New York State Freedom of Information Law and the Personal Privacy Protection Law.</p>
<p>Upstate may disclose <em>personal information</em> to federal or state law enforcement authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to Upstate's information technology assets.</p>
