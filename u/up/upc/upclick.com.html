In order to provide our               services, Upclick.com collects and uses your Personal Information provided               during your purchase.

This policy explains how we intend to treat your Personal               Information. </p>
                <p> If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on our Website, we               may transfer that Information within Upclick.com or to Upclick.com’s third-party               service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to               other countries or jurisdictions around the world. </p>

                <p> A cookie is a piece of data stored on the visitor's hard drive containing               information about the visitor that can only be read by the server that placed               cookie onto the visitor's hard drive. </p>

In               addition, there are number of privacy-enhancing tools and software that you may               purchase that will enable you to identify and block cookies on a selective               basis.
