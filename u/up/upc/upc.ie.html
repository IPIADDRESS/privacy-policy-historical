This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how we obtain and process your Personal Information when you use our products and services and when we provide you with our products and services. This Policy governs how UPC Communications Ireland Ltd. handles Personal Information you provide to us, subject to notice or consent where required by applicable law.
This Policy applies to all customers of UPC Communications Ireland Ltd. and its subsidiaries. It also applies to any visitors to our websites, who may or may not be customers of UPC Communications Ireland Ltd.
Please read this Policy in conjunction with our general terms and conditions and any terms and conditions that may apply to the products and services that you have signed up for.

Our products or services may contain links to other companies’ websites and services which they offer; these companies may have privacy policies of their own. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of such third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any such third parties’ products or third parties’ services.
</p>

<h4>What do we mean by “Personal Information”? </h4>

<p>With the objective of setting high privacy standards, we support a wide interpretation of what constitutes Personal Information, which we define as data that relates to any natural person such as an employee or consumer, including but not limited to names, addresses, birthdates and billing records. With respect to our customers and when the context so requires, Personal Information also includes traffic data, location data, IP addresses, internet usage data and set top box usage data.</p>
<div class="space">&nbsp;</div>

<h4>What Personal Information do we collect?</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of our services and products, we may collect the following Personal Information subject to notice or consent where relevant: </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Contact Information</b>, meaning information that allows us to identify or contact you. This information includes name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, user names and passwords, birthdates, gender, language preferences, delivery details, as well as other contact information which is collected directly from you. </li>
<li><b>Account Information</b>, meaning information you provide to us to set up our services such as bank account information, billing address, and information you provide us when you enter competitions or when you contact us inquiring about our products and services.</li>
<li><b>Service Information</b>, meaning information necessary for us to provide services to you, such as the model and service number of your set top box, software version used, smartcard ID, IP/MAC address and level of the service package. </li>
<li><b>General Usage Information</b>, meaning information generated when you use our products and services, for instance, when you utilize our network to make a phone call, use the internet, use our websites, view television programs, use Video on Demand (“VOD”) or when you browse the TV menus such as a TV Guide or VOD catalogue. </li>
<li><b>Other Personal Information</b>, meaning information we may obtain, in accordance with applicable law, from publicly available sources or from credit check agencies. We may also collect Personal Information about other people when you provide us with this, for example, if you buy one of our products as a present for another person. </li>

<div class="space">&nbsp;</div>


<h4>For what purposes do we use Personal Information?</h4>

<p>We collect information about you due to the nature of our services and products. It is important for us to ensure that our products and services are simple, personal and reliable.

<li><b>To present new products and services.</b> We may communicate with you about upcoming features in our products and services or promotions that might interest you. Please refer to Section “How can you opt-in and opt-out?” where we explain how you can update your marketing preferences.</li>
