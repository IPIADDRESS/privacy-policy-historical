                        <p><b>How Gorilla Nation Media Uses Collected Information</b><br>

                          Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII is used 

                          by Gorilla Nation Media in several ways, as follows:</p>

                        <p>• GNM's Promotions and Email divisions use the 

                          PII to deliver permission-based direct marketing messages 

                          based on a user's expressed interests.<br>

                          • If an online user voluntarily submits its email 

                          address to GNM, or one of its partners, online, he or 

                          she may receive periodic emails from Gorilla Nation 

                          Media with information on new services or products being 

                          offered by our company or by one of our partners.</p>
