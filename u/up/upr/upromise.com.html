 <h2 style="color:#666666"><b>Upromise Privacy Statement</b></h2>

 <p>
  Protecting your privacy is a top priority at Upromise.  We want you to
  understand how we handle the personal information about you that we may
  obtain, and how we may and may not share it.  This statement covers all of
  our information handling practices for Upromise, Inc. and its subsidiaries 
  for the benefit of current and past customers. Please also see our separate 
  statement, <a href="#privacy">Privacy of Upromise Rewards Service</a>, for 
  additional information about our practices relating to our Rewards service.
 </p>

 <p><b>Information We May Obtain</b>.</p>

 <p>
  As part of providing you products or services, we may obtain personal
  information from the following sources:
  </p><ul>
   <li>
    <b>Information you provide to us</b> on applications and other forms, that
    you otherwise enter on our web site, or that you provide to us in writing
    or by telephone, such as when you contact our customer service staff.  This
    information may include items such as your name, address, telephone number
    and social security number.  In addition, please see <b>Use of Cookies and
    other Technologies</b> below for information we receive automatically when
    you visit our web site.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Information from your transactions</b> with us, our affiliates or
    nonaffiliated third parties such as account activity and your purchase
    information in our Rewards service.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Information from third parties</b>, including public sources, such as
    verification services and consumer reporting agencies (to comply with
    regulatory requirements, ensure the accuracy of data and prevent fraud, for
    example), or from other sources (such as from other institutions like a
    bank or broker you use to  transfer funds into a Upromise account, or
    public sources).
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>
  We use the information we obtain in order to develop, offer and deliver our
  products and services, to process transactions in your accounts, and to
  fulfill legal and regulatory requirements.  We limit the collection and use
  of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service
  to our customers (including advising our customers about our products,
  services and other opportunities) and to administer our business.
 </p>
 
 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

 <a name="data"></a>
 <p><b>Sharing Information With Our Affiliates</b></p>
 <p>
  By sharing your personal information with our affiliates, we can better
  understand and meet your college savings and other needs by letting you 
  know about products, services and promotional offers in which you are most 
  likely to be interested. For example, if you have a Rewards account that 
  has accumulated sufficient funds, you may be interested in opening an 
  account with the Upromise College Fund, which can contact you directly about 
  how to do that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless you tell us not to, we may share with our affiliates all of the
  information we obtain about you.  If you prefer that we not share with our
  affiliates consumer report information about you that we may receive from
  third parties, you may direct us not to do so by sending us an email at 
  <a href="mailto:customercare@upromise.com">customercare@upromise.com</a>
  containing your name, address and account number, or by calling the following
  toll free number: 1-800-877-6647.  Please be aware that we may continue to
  share any <i>other</i> information as permitted by law.
 </p>     

 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
 <p><b>Sharing Information With Nonaffiliated Third Parties</b></p>

 <p>
  Information about our customers is an important part of our business.  We do
  not share your personal information with third parties except as permitted or
  required by law, including as provided below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <b>Agents and Service Providers.</b>  In order to provide our products and
   services, we may share any of the information we gather about you with
   agents and service providers to perform functions on our behalf, such as to
   send email and postal mail, analyze data, provide marketing services,
   process applications and credit card payments, and service accounts.  These
   service providers have access to personal information needed to perform
   their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Protection of Upromise and Others.</b>  We may disclose personal
   information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure is
   appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation,
   court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of a legal
   proceeding.  We may also disclose personal information as we believe
   appropriate to enforce or apply our rights under our agreements with
   customers, to protect the rights, property or safety of Upromise, our
   customers and others, including exchanging information for fraud protection
   and credit risk reduction.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Business Transfers.</b> If there is a change of control in Upromise's
   business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), its customer information
   could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying
   information potentially could be used by the purchaser. Notice will be 
   posted on the website so that you are aware of this change of control. 
   However, if that business materially changes this statement or the 
   information-handling practices as described in this statement, you will be 
   notified by email and/or through a notice posted on our web site, and you 
   will have a choice as to whether your existing information is used in a 
   new manner.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  If we ever make the decision to share customer personal information with
  third parties so that they may market their products and services directly to
  you, we will notify you ahead of time, and we will not share your information
  without your consent.

 <p><b>Use of Cookies and other Technologies</b></p>

 <p>
  Our web servers place and read "cookies" on our site's visitors' computers
  for a variety of purposes. Cookies are small data files that are stored on an
  Internet user's computer by a web server. One important use of cookies is to
  help identify you while you are logged in to the Upromise site. Consequently,
  if your browser does not accept session cookies, you will be unable to enroll
  or log in to our service using our site. You will, however, be able to browse
  our site as a visitor. The information Upromise collects from cookies and web
  server logs is used to administer the web service and customize information
  you receive when visiting our site. Upromise may also use and share aggregate
  information from cookies and web server logs to analyze and improve our web
  service offerings.  This information does not identify individual visitors or
  customers.
 </p>
 <p>
  As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and
  store it in log files.  This information includes the internet protocol (IP)
  addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
  pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this
  information to analyze trends, to administer our web site, to track users'
  movements around the web site and to gather demographic information about our
  user base as a whole. We, certain third parties who host portions of our web 
  site, and certain advertising affiliates or others employ cookies and/or 
  small pieces of code known as "web beacons" or 
  "clear gifs" that, on an anonymous basis, count users that have 
  visited a page that contains these web beacons. We use web beacons to help 
  us better manage content on our site and to determine which content is 
  effective. In addition, third party advertising affiliates and others may 
  use web beacons to help us track the effectiveness of our advertisements 
  placed on third party web sites. Web beacons on our site are not used to 
  collect personally identifiable information about our customers. Finally, we 
  use web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have 
  been opened by recipients so that we may gauge the effectiveness of our 
  communications. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see 
  "Choices Regarding the Receipt of Marketing Messages."
 </p>
 <p> 
  If you have not opted-out of receiving marketing messages from us about our 
  products and services, we may use information from our log files, cookies 
  or web beacons to help us make those communications more useful or 
  interesting to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also contract with Coremetrics, a third-party service provider, which uses
  these technologies to assist us in tracking site usage.  As a result of your
  accessing our site, Coremetrics may on our behalf collect information about
  you.  This service allows us to better provide our product or service to you.
  Coremetrics does not have the right to use the information they receive
  beyond what is necessary to assist us.  For further information, including
  how to opt out, consult Coremetrics' privacy policies at:

 <p><b>Choices Regarding the Receipt of Marketing Messages </b></p>

 <p>
  You may choose whether and to what extent you receive marketing messages from
  Upromise about products and services offered by Upromise or third parties. If
  you do not wish to receive marketing messages, you may opt out at any time.
  And we offer you choices, so that you receive offers that are of interest to
  you in the ways you wish. If you do not wish to receive messages, you may opt
  out by updating your account profile at any time on the Upromise web site, or
  by contacting a customer service representative at 1-800-877-6647. We reserve
  the right to send you specific administrative notices that are required by
  law, regulation, or as needed to service your account.

 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
 <a name="secure"></a>
 <p><b>Security of Your Personal Information </b></p>

 <p>
  Upromise is committed to earning and keeping your trust. We understand the
  need for our customers' personal information to remain secure and private,
  and we have deployed industry-recognized safeguards that meet federal
  standards for the protection of your personal information, including:
  monitoring for intrusion attempts; SSL (Secure Socket Layer), data, and
  password encryption technology; firewalls and systems monitoring; and
  security audits and inspections. Only authorized employees have access to
  customer information.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>Please remember that you also play a valuable part in data security. You
  should never share your Upromise password with anyone. If you feel your
  password has been compromised, you should change it immediately. After you
  have finished using our site, you should log out of your Upromise account and
  exit your browser so that no unauthorized persons can use our site under your
  name and account information.</i>
 </p>    

 <p><b>Collection of Information from Children.</b></p>

 <p>
  None of Upromise's products or services are intended for purchase by
  children.  Accordingly, Upromise does not knowingly collect, either online or
  offline, personally identifiable information from children under the age of
  13.
 </p>
 
 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
 <a name="changes"></a>
 
 <p><b>Changes to This Privacy Statement </b></p>
 <p>
  If we materially change this statement or our information-handling practices
  as described in this statement, we will notify you by email and/or through a
  notice on our web site at least 30 days prior to their implementation. You
  will have choices as to whether we use your existing information in a new
  manner.
 </p>    

 <a name="privacy"></a>
 <h2 style="color:#666666"><b>Privacy of Upromise Rewards Service</b></h2>
      
 <a name="info"></a>
 
 <p><b>What information does Upromise collect, and why?</b></p>
      
 <p>
  <b>Enrollment Information. </b>To set up your membership with the Upromise
  Rewards service, you will need to provide certain contact information, such
  as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, username, and
  password. This information will also allow us to contact you about new
  college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving these
  messages.
 </p>     
 <p>
  <b>Purchase Information.</b> As a Rewards service member, you can save for
  college by shopping with our contributing companies. We may require
  additional information in order to keep track of and collect your
  contributions. For example, if you use a credit card to make a purchase, we
  may use your credit card number to identify the transaction. A phone company
  might require your telephone number, while an airline might require your
  frequent flyer account number. To take part in our grocery service, you may
  need to provide a grocery loyalty card number.  In order to keep track of and
  collect your contributions, Upromise collects from some contributing
  companies, grocery retailers or third party processors details of your
  transactions such as the date and amount of your transaction.
 </p>    
 <p>
  <b>Rewards Account Information.</b> We will maintain records to keep track of
  the contributions you earn from your purchases with our contributing
  companies. You can use our website to view your Rewards service account
  balances and recent account activities, update your account profile,
  establish college savings goals, add new future college students, or contact
  a customer service representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>Future College Student Information.</b> In order to tell us how to direct
  your savings from your Rewards service account and link an investment account
  to the Rewards service you will need to provide certain information about
  those students <i>such as the name, date of birth and social security number
  of the student and the account number of the investment account</i>.
  You can also personalize your Rewards service account to
  reflect your progress toward achieving your personal college savings goals by
  providing additional information about your future college students, such as
  when they anticipate starting college and whether they plan to attend a
  public or private institution. We may use this information to contact you
  about college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving these
  messages.
 </p>     
 <p>
  <b>Investment Account Information.</b> When you open an investment account,
  the investment manager is required by law and by industry regulations to
  obtain certain personal information before creating your investment account.
  We and our investment manager partners will share certain personal
  information (such as your or your student's social security number or
  address) and demographic data with one another to facilitate the application
  process and monthly processing, and to comply with applicable law. This
  sharing of information is required to manage your account. Additionally, we
  may use this demographic information (such as your future college student's
  date of birth) to contact you about relevant college savings opportunities,
  unless you opt out of receiving such messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>Family and Friends Network Information.</b> You may use our Tell-a-Friend
  service to notify your family and friends about Upromise by providing their
  names and email addresses. You can also increase your college savings through
  Upromise by creating a savings network of family and friends that directs a
  portion of its Upromise savings to your future college students.
 </p>

 <p>
  Upromise will automatically send a one-time email inviting your family and
  friends to visit Upromise. We store the information for the purpose of
  sending these emails and to measure overall response rates to these services.
  Your family and friends may <a href="/nspage?su=8105">contact
  us</a> to request that their information be removed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Family and friends who contribute to your future college students' investment
  accounts will receive confirmation of the name and age of each future college
  student for whom they are saving.
 </p>      
 
 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
 <a name="useinfo"></a>
 <p><b>How does Upromise use my information?</b>
      
 </p><p>
  <b>Management of Your Account.</b> When you become a member, we use your
  contact and transaction data to manage your account.
 </p>

 <p>
  <b>Use of Third Parties for Fulfillment Purposes.</b> We may use certain
  third parties to provide marketing and administrative services, such as
  keeping track of your purchases, analyzing data or delivering special college
  saving offers to you on our behalf or on behalf of our contributing
  companies. Third parties may also be used to help us administer our grocery,
  dining and hotel rewards programs.  In order to obtain these services, we may
  need to share certain personally identifiable information about our members.
  However, these third parties will be bound by legal agreements to not use or
  disclose the information we provide them for any purpose other than to
  perform the requested service.
 </p>

 <p>
  On occasion, contests, sweepstakes or surveys on our web site may be
  co-sponsored by Upromise and another company, or may be sponsored by
  companies other than Upromise.  Some or all of the data collected through
  these contests, sweepstakes or surveys may be shared with the sponsor(s) or
  companies indicated on the entry form.  If such data will be shared, then
  there will be a notice prior to the time of data collection or transfer.
 </p>

 <p>
  <b>Notification About Products and Services.</b> We offer you the chance to
  maximize your Upromise membership through opportunities made available to 
  you on our site and, unless you opt out of receiving them, through email, 
  mail, and telephone messages. We may use information about you to provide you 
  offers tailored to your interests. Sometimes, we send offers to selected 
  groups of members on behalf of our contributing companies. When we do this, 
  we do not give the contributing company your name and address. If you do not 
  want to receive offers from contributing companies, you may opt out of 
  receiving them.
 </p>

 <p>
  <b>Use of Information from Third Parties.</b> We may obtain information about
  you from our contributing companies and other third parties in order to
  provide you with college savings opportunities tailored to your interests.
  You may opt out of receiving these offers <i>by updating your account profile at
  any time on our website, or by contacting a customer service representative
  at 1-800-877-6647</i>. We may also use information obtained from our contributing
  companies and other third parties in
  conjunction with member account and enrollment information for analytical and
  audit purposes.
 </p>     
 <p>
  <b>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b> We may also provide
  aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our members and
  their future college students to third parties for audit, marketing and other
  purposes. Because aggregated data is not associated with any particular
  person, these third parties will not have access to any personally
  identifiable information about you or your future college students.
 </p>

      
 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
 <p>
  <b>What are my choices regarding the receipt of marketing messages?</b><br>
  We reserve the right to send you specific administrative notices that are
  required by law, regulation, or as needed to service your account. You may
  choose to receive messages from Upromise and our contributing companies that
  may better suit your interests based on your preferences and transaction
  history. If you do not wish to receive these messages from Upromise and our
  contributing companies, you may opt out by updating your account profile at
  any time on our website.
 </p>     

 <a name="access"></a>
 
 <p>

  <b>What about links to other sites and contributing companies' use of
  information?</b><br>
  Through our various online offerings, we may provide links to third-party
  websites, such as those of our contributing companies or your investment
  manager. Each of these sites may have separate privacy and different
  data-collection practices from Upromise, and we are not responsible for the
  actions or practices of these third parties, nor for the content on these
  sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of their sites.  
  <i>In addition, the Personalized Offers feature of
  the Upromise Toolbar is provided by third parties, which also have separate
  privacy policies and data-collection practices which can be accessed when you
  down-load the Upromise Toolbar software.  To learn more about
  privacy and the Upromise Toolbar, please read the 
  <a href="/8208.do">Toolbar Privacy 
  Statement</a>.</i>  Finally, please remember that when you shop
  or do any other business with any of our contributing companies, any
  information you provide to them is subject to their own privacy and data
  collection practices, for which Upromise is not responsible.
