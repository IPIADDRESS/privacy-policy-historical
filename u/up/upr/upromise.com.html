   	<a name="why"></a>
   	<p class="subheadline2"><b>What information does Upromise collect, and why?</b>
   	
   	</p><p class="text"><b>Enrollment Information</b>.  To set up your membership with Upromise, you will need to provide certain contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, username, and password. This information will also allow us to contact you about new college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving these messages.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Purchase Information</b>. As a Upromise member, you can save for college by shopping with our contributing companies. Upromise may require additional information in order to keep track of and collect your contributions. For example, if you use a credit card to make a purchase, we may use your credit card number to identify the transaction. A phone company might require your telephone number, while an airline might require your frequent flyer account number.  In order to keep track of and collect your contributions, Upromise collects from some contributing companies or third party processors details of your transactions with contributing companies such as the date and amount of your transaction.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Upromise Account Information</b>.  Upromise will maintain records to keep track of the contributions you earn from your purchases with our contributing companies. You can use our website at www.upromise.com to view your Upromise account balances and recent account activities, establish college savings goals, add new future college students, or contact our customer care team.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Future College Student Information</b>.  In order to tell us how to direct your savings from your Upromise account and to open an investment account for your future college students, you will need to provide certain information about those students. You can also personalize your Upromise account to reflect your progress toward achieving your personal college savings goals by providing additional information about your future college students, such as when they anticipate starting college and whether they plan to attend a public or private institution. Upromise may use this information to contact you about college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving these messages.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Investment Account Information</b>.  When you open an investment account, the investment manager is required by law and by industry regulations to obtain certain personal information before creating your investment account. Upromise and its investment manager partners will share certain personal information (such as your or your student's Social Security Number or address) and demographic data with each other to facilitate the application process and monthly processing, and to comply with necessary tax reporting requirements.  This sharing of information is required to manage your account.  Additionally, Upromise may use this demographic information (such as your future college student's date of birth) to contact you about relevant college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving such messages.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Family and Friends Network Information</b>.  You may use our Tell-a-Friend service to notify your family and friends about Upromise by providing their names and email addresses.  You can also increase your college savings through Upromise by creating a savings network of family and friends that directs a portion of its Upromise savings to your future college students.
   	
   	</p><p>Upromise will automatically send a one-time email inviting your family and friends to visit Upromise.  Upromise stores the information for the purpose of sending these emails and to measure overall response rates to these services.  Your family and friends may  <a href="/nspage?su=8105">contact us</a> to request that their information be removed.
   	
   	</p><p>Family and friends who contribute to your future college students' investment accounts will receive confirmation of the name and age of each future college student for whom they are saving. You will soon be able to share access to additional information about these accounts with your family and friends network, including messages and progress towards your goal, if you wish.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Computer Information</b>.  We collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to the Upromise site. This information is collected from your computer's web browser, and may include your current IP address, type of operating system, and type of web browser software.  See the section below on "Use of Cookies," which discusses how we obtain this information.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Collection of Information from Children</b>.  Upromise does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
   	
   	</p><p class="subheadline2"><b>How does Upromise use my information?</b>
   	
   	</p><p class="text"><b>Management of Your Account</b>.  When you become a member, Upromise uses your contact and transaction data to manage your account.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Use of Third Parties for Fulfillment Purposes</b>.  Upromise may use certain third-party processors to provide administrative services, such as keeping track of your purchases or delivering special college saving offers to you on our behalf. In order to obtain these services, Upromise may need to share certain personally identifiable information about our members. However, those third parties will be bound by legal agreements to not use or disclose the information Upromise provides them for any purpose other than to administer the service.
   	
   	<a name="comm"></a></p><p><b>Notification About Products and Services</b>.  Upromise offers you the chance to maximize your savings through new college savings opportunities made available to you on our site and, unless you opt out of receiving them, through email, mail, and telephone messages. Upromise may use information about you to provide you offers tailored to your interests.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Use of Information from Third Parties</b>.  We may obtain information about you from our contributing companies and other third parties in order to provide you with college savings opportunities tailored to your interests. You may opt out of receiving these offers. Upromise may also use information obtained from our contributing companies and other third parties in conjunction with member account and enrollment information for marketing and audit purposes. See the section below on "Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information" for related information.
   	
   	<a name="cookies"></a></p><p><b>Use of Cookies</b>.  Our web servers place and read "cookies" on our site's visitors'
   	computers for a variety of purposes.  Cookies are small data files that are
   	stored on an Internet user's computer by a web server.
   	One important use of cookies is to validate your identity while you are logged in to the Upromise site.  Consequently, if your browser does not accept session cookies, you will be unable to enroll or log in to our service.  You will, however, be able to browse our site as a visitor.  The information Upromise collects from cookies and web server logs is used to administer the web service and customize information you receive when visiting our site.  Upromise may also use and share aggregate information from cookies and web server logs to analyze and improve our web service offerings.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>.  Upromise may also provide aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our members and their future college students to third parties for audit and marketing purposes. Because aggregated data is not associated with any particular person, these third parties will not have access to any personally identifiable information about you or your future college students.
   	
   	</p><p><b>Transfers of Information for Legal Purposes</b>.  Upromise may need to disclose certain information to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or search warrant, or in the course of a legal proceeding or lawsuit. If there is a change of control in Upromise's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), its customer information could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially used by the purchaser.  If, as a result of such a change of control in Upromise's business, there is a material change in this statement or our information-handling practices as described in this statement, we will post the changes on this privacy statement and on our website at least 30 days prior to their implementation.  We will also send an email notification to our members.  You will have a choice as to whether we use your existing information in a new manner.
   	
   	<a name="optout"></a></p><p class="subheadline2"><b>What are my choices regarding how my personal information is used by Upromise?</b>
   	
   	</p><p class="text">We reserve the right to send you specific administrative notices that are required by law, regulation, or as needed to service your account. You may choose to receive messages from Upromise and our contributing companies that may better suit your interests based on your preferences and transaction history. If you do not wish to receive these messages from Upromise and our contributing companies, you may opt out during the registration process or by updating your profile at any time on the "Your Account" page.

   	</p><p class="text">Upromise is committed to earning and keeping your trust.

   	</p><p class="text">Through our various online offerings, we may provide links to third-party websites, such as those of our contributing companies or your investment manager. Each of these sites may have separate privacy and different data-collection practices from Upromise, and Upromise is not responsible for the actions or practices of these third parties, nor for the content on these sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of their sites.
