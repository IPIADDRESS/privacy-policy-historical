 <h2 style="color:#666666"><strong>Upromise Privacy Statement</strong></h2>

 <p>
  Protecting your privacy is a top priority at Upromise. We want you to 
  understand how we handle the personal information about you that we may 
  obtain, and how we may and may not share it. This statement covers all of 
  our information handling practices for Upromise, Inc. and its subsidiaries, 
  including Upromise Investments, Inc. and Upromise Investment Advisors, LLC, 
  for the benefit of current and past customers.  Please also see our separate 
  statement, <a href="#privacy">Privacy of Upromise Rewards Service</a>, for 
  additional information about our practices relating to our Rewards service.
 </p>

 <p><strong>Information We May Obtain</strong>.</p>

 <p>
  As part of providing you products or services, we may obtain personal
  information from the following sources:
  </p><ul>
   <li>
    <strong>Information you provide to us</strong> on applications and other 
    forms, that you otherwise enter on our web site, or that you provide to us 
    in writing or by telephone, such as when you contact our customer service 
    staff. This information may include items such as your name, address, 
    telephone number and social security number. In addition, please see 
    <strong>Use of Cookies and other Technologies</strong> below for 
    information we receive automatically when you visit our web site. 
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>Information from your transactions</strong> with us, our affiliates or
    nonaffiliated third parties such as account activity and your purchase
    information in our Rewards service.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>Information from third parties</strong>, including public sources, 
    such as verification services and consumer reporting agencies (to comply 
    with regulatory requirements, ensure the accuracy of data and prevent fraud,
    forexample), or from other sources (such as from other institutions like a
    bank or broker you use to  transfer funds into a Upromise account, or
    public sources).
   </li>
  </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p>
  We use the information we obtain in order to develop, offer and deliver our 
  products and services, to offer products and services of our affiliates, 
  participating companies, marketing partners and other companies, to process 
  transactions in your accounts, and to fulfill legal and regulatory 
  requirements. 
 </p>

 <p>
  Please note that information you voluntarily include in bulletin boards, chat
  rooms and other online forums, such as the Upromise Community, may be viewed 
  and used by anyone with access to those forums.  Upromise is unable to 
  control any use of such information.

 <a name="data"></a>
 <p><strong>Sharing Information With Our Affiliates</strong></p>
 <p>
  As a subsidiary of SLM Corporation, commonly known as Sallie Mae, our 
  affiliates are the family of companies controlled by SLM Corporation.  Our 
  affiliates include, among others, Sallie Mae, Inc., Upromise Investments, 
  Inc., Upromise Investment Advisors, LLC, Student Loan Funding Resources, 
  Nellie Mae Corporation, Southwest Student Services Corporation, Student Loan 
  Finance Association, Academic Management Services Corp., SLM Financial 
  Corporation, and Sallie Mae Bank.  Our affiliates offer a broad range of 
  products and services including education loans, private loans, mortgage 
  loans, 529 college savings plan administrative services and debt collection 
  services.  By sharing your personal information with our affiliates, we and 
  our affiliates can better understand and meet your college savings and other 
  needs by letting you know about products, services and promotional offers in 
  which you are most likely to be interested. For example, if you have a 
  Rewards account that has accumulated sufficient funds, you may be interested 
  in opening an account with the Upromise College Fund, or if you have a high 
  school student, you may be interested in learning more about Sallie Mae 
  student loans.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unless you tell us not to, we may share with our affiliates all of the
  information we obtain about you.  If you prefer that we not share with our
  affiliates consumer report information about you that we may receive from
  third parties, you may direct us not to do so by sending us an email at 
  <a href="mailto:customercare@upromise.com">customercare@upromise.com</a>
  containing your name, address and account number and request, or by calling 
  the following toll free number: 1-800-877-6647.  Please be aware that we may 
  continue to share any other information as permitted by law.
 </p>

 <div class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
      
 <p><strong>Sharing Information With Nonaffiliated Third Parties</strong></p>

 <p>
  Information about our customers is an important part of our business. We do 
  not share your personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except 
  as permitted or required by law, including as provided below: 
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>Agents and Service Providers.</strong>  In order to provide our 
   products and services, we may share personal information about you with 
   agents and service providers to perform functions on our behalf, such as to 
   send email and postal mail, analyze data, provide marketing services, process
   applications and credit card payments, and service accounts. We 
   contractually obligate these service providers to access and use personal 
   information only as needed to perform their functions and for no other 
   purposes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Financial Services Providers.</strong>  In order to make certain 
   financial products available to you (for example, credit cards, loans or 
   insurance), we sometimes enter into marketing agreements with nonaffiliated 
   financial institutions that offer those products. We select the financial 
   institutionswe work with very carefully.  Generally, we provide these 
   entities with only customer contact information. For some products, we might
   also provide them limited additional information. These entities are 
   permitted to use the information we give them only for the specific products
   being offered under our contract. If you prefer that we do not share your 
   information with nonaffiliated financial institutions so that they may 
   market their products and services directly to you, you may opt-out of that 
   information sharing by sending us an email at customercare@upromise.com 
   containing your name, address, account number and request, or by calling the
   following toll free number: 1-800-877-6647.  You may also opt-out of that 
   information sharing by updating your Upromise account member profile opt-out
   preferences on our website to opt-out of receiving communications from our 
   participating companies.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Protection of Upromise and Others.</strong>  We may disclose personal
   information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure is 
   appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, 
   court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of a legal 
   proceeding. We may also disclose personal information as we believe 
   appropriate to enforce or apply our rights under our agreements with 
   customers, to protect the rights, property or safety of Upromise, our 
   customers and others, including exchanging information for fraud protection 
   and credit risk reduction. 
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If there is a change of control in 
   Upromise's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), its customer 
   information could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally 
   identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser. Notice 
   will be posted on the website so that you are aware of this change of 
   control.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Upromise does not share member information with nonaffiliated, non-financial 
  institutions to enable them to market their products and services directly to
  you.  Occasionally, we engage third party service providers in the business 
  of facilitating communications to send you information from certain 
  participating companies, but only subject to strict confidentiality 
  provisions that prohibit those third parties from providing your personal 
  information to the participating companies.  If we ever make the decision 
  to share member information with nonaffiliated third parties other than 
  financial institutions as described above so that they may market their 
  products and services directly to you, we will notify you ahead of time, 
  and you will have the opportunity to opt-out of that information sharing.

 <p><strong>Use of Cookies and other Technologies</strong></p>

 <p>
  Our web servers place and read "cookies" on our site's visitors' web browser 
  for a variety of purposes. Cookies are small data files that are stored on 
  an Internet user's web browser by a web server. One important use of cookies 
  is to help identify you while you are logged in to the Upromise site. 
  Consequently, if your browser does not accept session cookies, you will be 
  unable to enroll or log in to our service using our site. You will, however, 
  be able to browse our site as a visitor. The information Upromise collects 
  from cookies and web server logs is used to administer the web service and 
  customize information you receive when visiting our site. Upromise may also 
  use and share aggregate information from cookies and web server logs to 
  analyze and improve our web service offerings. This information does not 
  identify individual visitors or customers. 
 </p>
 <p>
  As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically 
  and store it in log files. This information includes the internet protocol 
  (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
  pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this 
  information to analyze trends, to administer our web site, to track users' 
  movements around the web site and to gather demographic information about our
  user base as a whole. We, certain third parties who host portions of our web 
  site, and certain advertising affiliates or others employ cookies and/or 
  small pieces of code known as "web beacons" or "clear gifs" that, on an 
  anonymous basis, count users that have visited a page that contains these 
  web beacons. We use web beacons to help us better manage content on our site 
  and to determine which content is effective. In addition, third party 
  advertising affiliates and others may use web beacons to help us track the 
  effectiveness of our advertisements placed on third party web sites. Web 
  beacons on our site are not used to collect personally identifiable 
  information about our customers. Finally, we use web beacons in our 
  HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients 
  so that we may gauge the effectiveness of our communications. If you would 
  like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choices Regarding the Receipt 
  of Marketing Messages."

 </p>
 <p> 
  If you have not opted-out of receiving marketing messages from us about our 
  products and services, we may use information from our log files, cookies or 
  web beacons to help us make those communications more useful or interesting 
  to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of our third party service providers that uses these technologies to 
  assist us in tracking site usage is Coremetrics. As a result of your 
  accessing our site, Coremetrics may on our behalf collect information about 
  you. This service allows us to better provide our product or service to you. 
  Coremetrics does not have the right to use the information they receive

  from our participating companies based on our information. If you do not wish
  to receive any of these marketing messages, you may opt out.  . And we offer 
  you choices, so that you may elect to receive offers that are of interest to 
  you in the ways you wish. If you do not wish to receive marketing messages, 
  you may opt out by sending us an email at

 <p><strong>Security of Your Personal Information </strong></p>

 <p>
  Upromise is committed to earning and keeping your trust. We understand the 
  need for our customers' personal information to remain secure and private, 
  and we have implemented policies and procedures designed to safeguard your 
  information. The only Upromise employees who are authorized to see your 
  personal information are those who need it as part of their jobs. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Please remember that you also play a valuable part in data security. You 
  should never share your Upromise password with anyone. If you feel your 
  password has been compromised, you should change it immediately. After you 
  have finished using our site, you should log out of your Upromise account

 <p><strong>State Laws</strong></p>

 <p>
  In addition to the rights described in this policy, please note that you may 
  have additional rights under state law.  For example, if your address on 
  file with us is a California address, we will not share personal information 
  about you with a financial institution with whom we have a joint marketing 
  relationship unless we provide you the required notice under California law 
  and you do not opt-out of that information sharing.  In addition, if your 
  address on file with us is a Vermont address, we will not share consumer 
  report information about you with our affiliates unless you expressly consent
  to that information sharing.

  <strong>Privacy of Upromise Rewards Service</strong>
 </h2>

 <a name="info"></a>

 <p><strong>What information does Upromise collect, and why?</strong></p>

 <p>
  <strong>Enrollment Information.</strong> To set up your membership with the 
  Upromise Rewards service, you will need to provide certain contact 
  information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number,
  username, and password. This information will also allow us to contact you 
  about new college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving 
  these messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Purchase Information.</strong> As a Rewards service member, you can 
  save for college by shopping with our participating companies. We may require 
  additional information in order to keep track of and collect your 
  contributions. For example, if you use a credit card to make a purchase, we 
  may use your credit card number to identify the transaction. A phone company 
  might require your telephone number, while an airline might require your 
  frequent flyer account number. To take part in our grocery service, you may 
  need to provide a grocery loyalty card number. In order to keep track of and 
  collect your contributions, Upromise collects from some participating 
  companies, grocery retailers or third party processors details of your 
  transactions such as the date and amount of your transaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Rewards Account Information.</strong> We will maintain records to keep
  track of the contributions you earn from your purchases with our participating
  companies. You can use our website to view your Rewards service account 
  balances and recent account activities, update your account profile, 
  establish college savings goals, add new future college students, or contact 
  a customer service representative.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Student Information.</strong> In order to link an eligible investment 
  account or student loan account to the Rewards service so that we may direct 
  your savings from your Rewards service account to the investment or student 
  loan account you will need to provide certain information about the students 
  or future students for whom you are saving such as the name, date of birth and
  social security number of the student and the account number of the 
  investment or loan account. You can also personalize your Rewards service 
  account to reflect your progress toward achieving your personal college 
  savings goals by providing additional information about your future college 
  students, such as when they anticipate starting college and whether they 
  plan to attend a public or private institution. We may use this information 
  to contact you about college savings opportunities, unless you opt out of 
  receiving these messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Investment Account Information.</strong> When you open an investment 
  account, the investment manager is required by law and by industry 
  regulations to obtain certain personal information before creating your 
  investment account. We and our investment manager partners will share certain
  personal information (such as your or your student's social security number 
  or address) and demographic data with one another to facilitate the 
  application process and monthly processing, and to comply with applicable 
  law. This sharing of information is required to manage your account. 
  Additionally, we may use this demographic information (such as your future 
  college student's date of birth) to contact you about relevant college 
  savings opportunities, unless you opt out of receiving such messages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Family and Friends Network Information.</strong> You may use our 
  Tell-a-Friend service to notify your family and friends about Upromise by 
  providing their names and email addresses. You can also increase your 
  college savings through Upromise by creating a savings network of family and 
  friends that directs a portion of its Upromise savings to your future 
  college students.
 </p>

 <p>
  Upromise will automatically send a one-time email inviting your family and
  friends to visit Upromise. We store the information for the purpose of

 <p><strong>How does Upromise use my information?</strong>
      
 </p><p>
  <strong>Management of Your Account.</strong> When you become a member, we use your
  contact and transaction data to manage your account.
 </p>

 <p>
  <strong>Use of Third Parties for Fulfillment Purposes.</strong> We may use 
  certain third parties to provide marketing and administrative services, such 
  as keeping track of your purchases, analyzing data or delivering special 
  college saving offers to you on our behalf or on behalf of our participating 
  companies. Third parties may also be used to help us administer our grocery, 
  dining, travel and other rewards programs. In order to obtain these services,
  we may need to share certain personally identifiable information about our 
  members. However, these third parties will be bound by legal agreements to 
  not use or disclose the information we provide them for any purpose other 
  than to perform the requested service.
 </p>

 <p>
  On occasion, contests, sweepstakes or surveys on our web site may be 
  co-sponsored by Upromise and another company, or may be sponsored by 
  companies other than Upromise. Some or all of the data collected through 
  these contests, sweepstakes or surveys may be shared with the sponsor(s) or 
  companies indicated on the entry form or in the applicable rules.
 </p>

 <p>
  <strong>Notification About Products and Services.</strong> We offer you the 
  chance to maximize your Upromise membership through opportunities made 
  available to you on our site and, unless you opt out of receiving them, 
  through email, mail, and telephone messages. We may use information about 
  you to provide you offers tailored to your interests. Sometimes, we send 
  offers to selected groups of members on behalf of our participating 
  companies and/or affiliates.  Occasionally, we engage third parties in the 
  business of facilitating communications to send you information from certain 
  participating companies, but only subject to strict confidentiality 
  provisions that prohibit those third parties from providing your personal 
  information to the participating companies.  In addition, unless you 
  opt-out, we may share your information with nonaffiliated financial 
  institutions with whom we have a marketing relationship so that those 
  participating companies may market to you the specific products being 
  offered under our contract with them.  If you do not want to receive any of 
  these marketing communications, you may opt out of receiving them.
 </p>

 <p>
  <strong>Use of Information from Third Parties.</strong> We may obtain 
  information about you from our participating companies and other third 
  parties in order to provide you with college savings opportunities tailored 
  to your interests. You may opt out of receiving these offers by updating 
  your account profile at any time on our website, or by contacting a customer 
  service representative at 1-800-877-6647. We may also use information 
  obtained from our participating companies and other third parties in 
  conjunction with member account and enrollment information for analytical 
  and audit purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We may also 
  provide aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our 
  members and their future college students to third parties for audit, 
  marketing and other purposes. Because aggregated data is not associated with 
  any particular person, these third parties will not have access to any 
  personally identifiable information about you or your future college students.

  required by law, regulation, or as needed to service your account. You may 
  choose whether or not to receive messages from Upromise and our participating

  your name, address, account number and request, or by calling the following 
  toll free number: 1-800-877-6647.  You may also opt-out of receiving 
  marketing emails from Upromise and marketing messages from our participating 
  companies by updating your Upromise account member profile opt-out 
  preferences on our web site.  Our participating companies reserve the right 
  to contact you using information from sources other than Upromise.

 <p>
  <strong>What about links to other sites and participating companies' use of
  information?</strong><br>
  Through our various online offerings, we may provide links to third-party 
  websites, such as those of our participating companies or your investment 
  manager. Each of these sites may have separate privacy and different 
  data-collection practices from Upromise, and we are not responsible for the 
  actions or practices of these third parties, nor for the content on these 
  sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of their sites. In 
  addition, our remindU service and the Personalized Offers feature of the 
  Upromise Toolbar are provided by third parties, which also have  separate 
  privacy policies and data-collection practices which can be accessed when 
  you download the remindU and Upromise Toolbar software.  To learn more about 
  privacy and the Upromise Toolbar, please read the 
  <a href="/member/toolbar/privacy.do">Toolbar Privacy Statement</a>.
  Finally, please remember that when you shop or do any other business with 
  any of our participating companies, any information you provide to them is 
  subject to their own privacy and data collection practices, for which 
  Upromise is not responsible.
