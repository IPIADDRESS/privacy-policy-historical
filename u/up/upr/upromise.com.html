  	</p><p class="text">Protecting your privacy is a top priority at Upromise.  We want you to understand how we handle the personal information about you that we may obtain, and how we may and may not share it.  This statement covers all of our information handling practices for Upromise, Inc. and its affiliates (companies under common ownership with Upromise) for the benefit of current and past customers.  Please also see our separate statement, <a href="#privacy">Privacy of Upromise Rewards Service</a>, for additional information about our practices relating to our Rewards service.
  	
  	</p><p><b>Information We May Obtain</b>.<br><br>
  	As part of providing you products or services, we may obtain personal information from the following sources:
  	</p><ul>
  	<li><b>Information you provide to us</b> on applications and other forms, that you otherwise enter on our web site, or that you provide to us in writing or by telephone, such as when you contact our customer service staff.  This information may include items such as your name, address, telephone number and social security number.  In addition, please see <b>Use of Cookies and other Technologies</b> below for information we receive automatically when you visit our web site.
  	</li><li><b>Information from your transactions</b> with us, our affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties such as account activity and your purchase information in our Rewards service.
  	</li><li><b>Information from third parties</b>, including public sources, such as verification services and consumer reporting agencies (to comply with regulatory requirements, ensure the accuracy of data and prevent fraud, for example), or from other sources (such as from other institutions like a bank or broker you use to  transfer funds into a Upromise account, or public sources).
  	</li></ul>
  	We use the information we obtain in order to develop, offer and deliver our products and services, to process transactions in your accounts, and to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements.  We limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers (including advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities) and to administer our business.
  	
  	<div align="right" class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
  	
  	<a name="data"></a><p><b>Sharing Information With Our Affiliates</b><br><br>
  	By sharing your personal information with our affiliates, we can better understand and meet your college savings needs by letting you know about products, services and promotional offers in which you are most likely to be interested.  For example, if you have a Rewards account that has accumulated sufficient funds, you may be interested in opening an account with the Upromise College Fund, which can contact you directly about how to do that. <br><br>
  	Unless you tell us not to, we may share with our affiliates all of the information we obtain about you.  If you prefer that we not share with our affiliates consumer report information about you that we may receive from third parties, you may direct us not to do so by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:customercare@upromise.com">customercare@upromise.com</a> containing your name, address and account number, or by calling the following toll free number: 1-800-877-6647.  Please be aware that we may continue to share any <i>other</i> information as permitted by law.
  	
  	</p><div align="right" class="smalltext"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
  	
  	<p><b>Sharing Information With Nonaffilated Third Parties</b><br>
  	Information about our customers is an important part of our business.  We do not share your personal information with third parties except as permitted or required by law, including as provided below:
  	</p><ul>
  	<li><b>Agents and Service Providers.</b>  In order to provide our products and services, we may share any of the information we gather about you with agents and service providers to perform functions on our behalf, such as to send email and postal mail, analyze data, provide marketing services, process applications and credit card payments, and service accounts.  These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  	</li><li><b>Protection of Upromise and Others.</b>  We may disclose personal information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of a legal proceeding.  We may also disclose personal information as we believe appropriate to enforce or apply our rights under our agreements with customers, to protect the rights, property or safety of Upromise, our customers and others, including exchanging information for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  	</li><li><b>Business Transfers.</b>  If there is a change of control in Upromise's business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), its customer information could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser.  However, if that business materially changes this statement or the information-handling practices as described in this statement, you will be notified by email and/or through a notice posted on our web site, and you will have a choice as to whether your existing information is used in a new manner.
  	</li></ul>
  	If we ever make the decision to share customer personal information with third parties so that they may market their products and services directly to you, we will notify you ahead of time, and we will not share your information without your consent.

  	Our web servers place and read "cookies" on our site's visitors' computers for a variety of purposes. Cookies are small data files that are stored on an Internet user's computer by a web server. One important use of cookies is to help identify you while you are logged in to the Upromise site. Consequently, if your browser does not accept session cookies, you will be unable to enroll or log in to our service using our site. You will, however, be able to browse our site as a visitor. The information Upromise collects from cookies and web server logs is used to administer the web service and customize information you receive when visiting our site. Upromise may also use and share aggregate information from cookies and web server logs to analyze and improve our web service offerings.  This information does not identify individual visitors or customers.

A phone company might require your telephone number, while an airline might require your frequent flyer account number. To take part in our grocery service, you may need to provide a grocery loyalty card number.
