<p>
 This policy covers Upromise, Inc.'s practices relating to the 
 information it collects from or about its current and past members, 
 website visitors and users of its mobile applications, including your 
 rights to limit the sharing of certain information we may have about 
 you. References in this policy to the Upromise website include any 
 mobile websites we may operate. Our affiliates, including our subsidiaries, 
 have separate privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
 This privacy policy applies to the Upromise service, the Upromise website, 
 and our mobile applications.  We do not exercise control over any other 
 websites or services made available to you through the Upromise service, 
 such as those of our participating companies. These sites and services 
 may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data 
 or solicit information from you.  We are not responsible for the actions or 
 practices of these third parties.  In addition, certain portions of the Upromise 
 service, including sites, applications, programs, toolbars and utilities, may 
 be operated by third parties, and your participation in those portions of 
 Upromise may be subject to additional privacy policies provided by 
 Upromise and/or the privacy policies of the third parties that operate them.  If a 
 portion of the Upromise service is subject to the privacy policy of a third party, 
 we will disclose that and provide a link to the third party's privacy policy.  
 We encourage you to review their policies carefully.  Your use of the Upromise 
 websites, services, applications and utilities operated by third parties may be 
 subject to separate privacy policies and your use will constitute your consent 
 to those separate policies.  In the event of any conflict between this privacy 
 policy and any such other privacy policy, the other privacy policy will govern 
 only with respect to the applicable services covered by such other privacy 
 policy.  We also work with third party advertisers and may make available 
 third party applications, both of which, to the extent permitted by applicable 
 law, may collect information about you and/or your online activities over time 
 and across different websites and mobile applications (collectively referred to 
 as "Sites"), including the Upromise Sites, and are further described below 
 in the section below titled "Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Applications and Services."  
</p>
<h4 class="extraBotPad">
 Information We May Obtain
</h4>

<p>
 As part of providing you products or services, we may obtain information 
 about you from various sources, including the following:
</p>

<p>
 <u>Information you provide</u>. We obtain information you provide to us 
 when you join Upromise, that you otherwise enter through our website or 
 mobile applications, or that you provide to us in writing or by telephone, 
 such as when you contact our customer care staff. This information may 
 include items such as your name, address, mobile device ID (UDID), 
 telephone number, location, social security number, credit card numbers 
 and/or other financial account information such as student loan, savings 
 account and/or 529 college savings account numbers. If you give Upromise 
 your current physical location, for example, when you use a Upromise 
 mobile application or 
 give us your current ZIP code, we may use and store that information to 
 provide you with location-based information or messaging, including, for 
 example, offers or advertising. If you do not want to give Upromise your 
 location, do not enter your current location on our website or mobile 
 applications and do not allow your browser or mobile device to send it to us. 
 Please also see the section titled "Log information" below for 
 information we receive automatically when you visit our website or use 
 our mobile applications.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Information from third parties</u>. We may obtain information about you 
 from third parties including Upromise participating companies, our 
 affiliates, public sources and others. This information could include, 
 among other things, information about your purchases with Upromise 
 participating companies, information about your transactions and account 
 activity with us, our affiliates and others, your location if you allow 
 your browser and/or mobile device provider to send it to us, your mobile device ID, 
 publicly available demographic data, and information needed to comply 
 with regulatory requirements, ensure the accuracy of data, better 
 understand your likely interests, and/or prevent fraud.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Cookies and other technologies</u>. When you visit the Upromise 
  website or open a Upromise e-mail, 
 we send one or more <a href="#cookies">cookies</a>
 to your computer or other device. We also use other similar technologies 
 such as tracking pixels, tags or similar tools when you visit our website, 
 open a Upromise e-mail, or use our mobile applications. These technologies 
 can collect data  regarding your operating system, browser type, device type, mobile device 
 ID, screen resolution, IP address and other technical information, as 
 well as navigation events and session information as you interact with 
 our website or mobile applications. Among other things, this information 
 allows us to understand how you use the Upromise service, website and mobile applications 
 and what products and services may be of interest to you. The cookies we 
 place can also be used to allow the advertising networks we work with to 
 set and read their own cookies and collect similar information. Please see 
 the section titled "Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Applications 
 and Services" below for more information about our use of third party 
 advertisers. You can generally remove, block, or disable cookies using the 
 settings in your web browser. However, if you remove the cookies we place, 
 it will impact your ability to use Upromise since you will be unable to 
 enroll or log in to our service through our website. You will, however, be 
 able to browse our website as a visitor. If you are a member of Upromise, 
 information collected using cookies or similar technologies may be 
 associated with personally identifiable information, such as name and 
 e-mail address, we have about you.
</p>

<p>
 One of the service providers we may use to track and analyze usage of our 
 website and mobile applications is Omniture by Adobe, a third party 
 analytics company. Omniture by Adobe uses our cookie and log information 
 (described below), in combination with personally identifying information 
 we may provide, such as name and e-mail address, to assist us in tracking 
 Upromise website and mobile application usage in order to improve them and 
 our products and services offerings. Omniture acts as our agent, and is 
 authorized to use the information we share exclusively to provide this 
 service to Upromise. For further information, including how to opt out, 
 consult Omniture's privacy policies at: 
 <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7',800,600,true);return false;">http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7</a>.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Log information</u>. When you access a page of the Upromise Sites 
 via a browser, application, other client 
 or device, our servers automatically record certain information known as 
 "log information." This may include information such as the web 
 page you are coming from or going to, terms you search, pages you view on a 
 Upromise website or mobile application, your interaction with a website, 
 application or online service provider, your Internet Protocol address, 
 mobile device ID or telephone number, browser type, browser language, 
 device type, and data contained in one or more cookies that may uniquely 
 identify your browser, your computer, your device and/or your Upromise 
 account. This information is logged by our web servers, allowing us to 
 deliver services or information you have requested, better understand 
 user behavior on our websites and applications, assist in troubleshooting 
 problems, and improve the quality of our service. Please be aware that in 
 some cases your internet protocol address could be used to determine your 
 general location.

 to control access to or use of such information. To request removal of 
 your personal information from our bulletin board or other online forums, 
 contact us as described below under "Contacting Upromise about this 
 Privacy Policy." In some cases, we may not be able to reasonably 
 accommodate your request to remove your personal information, in which 
 case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
</p>

<h4 class="extraBotPad">
 Our Information Sharing Practices
</h4>

<p>
 Information about our members, former members, website visitors and mobile 
 application users is an important part of our business. We do not 
 share your <a href="#personalinformation">personal 
 information</a> except as permitted or required by law, 
 including as provided below:
</p>

<p>
 <u>Affiliates</u>. We may provide personal information about you to our 
 affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our affiliates are 
 the family of companies controlled by SLM Corporation and include, among 
 others, Sallie Mae, Inc., Student Loan Funding Resources, Nellie Mae Corporation, 
 Southwest Student Services Corporation, Student Loan Finance Association, 
 Academic Management Services Corp., SLM Financial Corporation, and Sallie 
 Mae Bank.
</p>

<p>
 Unless you tell us not to, we may share with our affiliates all of the 
 information we obtain about you. If you prefer that we not share with our 
 affiliates consumer report information that we may receive about you, 
 you may direct us not to do so by clicking on this 
 <a href="/secure/affiliate/sharing/optOut.do" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('/secure/affiliate/sharing/optOut.do',800,600,true);return false;">link</a> and 
 providing the requested information. Please be aware that we may continue 
 to share any other information as permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Sharing Information with Nonaffiliated Third Parties</u>. We do not 
 share your personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except as 
 permitted or required by law, including as provided below:
</p>

<ul id="listIndent">
 <li>
  <u>Agents and Service Providers</u>. In order to provide our products 
  and services, we may share personal information about you with agents and 
  service providers located in the U.S. and in other countries to perform 
  functions on our behalf, such as to send email and postal mail, analyze 
  data, provide marketing services, process applications and credit card 
  payments, and service accounts. When we use these third parties, we may 
  disclose any of the personal information that we collect, although we 
  give them only the personal information reasonably needed to perform 
  the service. We contractually obligate these service providers to 
  access and use personal information only as needed to perform their 
  functions for us and for no other purposes.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Financial Services Providers</u>. In order to make certain financial 
  products available to you (for example, credit cards, loans or insurance), 
  we sometimes enter into joint marketing agreements with nonaffiliated 
  financial institutions that offer those products. We may provide these 
  entities with any of the personal information that we collect, although 
  we give them only the personal information reasonably necessary under 
  the marketing agreement. We select the financial institutions we work 
  with very carefully, and these entities are permitted to use the 
  personal information we give them only for the specific products being 
  offered under our contract. 
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Maintain and Service your Upromise Account</u>. We may disclose 
  personal information about you to third parties as reasonably necessary 
  to maintain and service your Upromise account, including to facilitate 
  transactions you've requested and to track and process your Upromise 
  earnings.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Protection of Upromise and Others</u>. We may disclose personal 
  information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure 
  is appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, 
  regulation, court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course 
  of a legal proceeding. We may also disclose personal information as 
  we believe appropriate to enforce or apply our rights under our 
  agreements (such as, for example, our Member Agreement) with third parties, 
  including our members, and to protect the rights, property or safety 
  of Upromise, our members and others, including exchanging information 
  for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Business Transfers</u>. If there is a change of control in Upromise's 
  business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), our members' information 
  could be sold as part of that transaction and your personal information 
  potentially could be used by the purchaser. If the purchaser intends to 
  materially change the terms applicable to your personal information, 
  you will be notified by a notice posted on the website or in another 
  appropriate manner and be given appropriate choices with respect to 
  previously collected personal information.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>With your consent</u>. We also may share your personal information with 
  a third party if you consent to the sharing.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Upromise does not share personal information with nonaffiliated, 
 non-financial institutions to enable them to market their products and 
 services directly to you. Occasionally, we engage third party service 
 providers in the business of facilitating communications to send you 
 information from certain participating companies, but only subject to 
 strict confidentiality provisions that prohibit those third parties from 
 providing your personal information to the participating companies. If we 
 ever make the decision to share personal information with nonaffiliated 
 third parties other than financial institutions as described above so 
 that they may market their products and services directly to you, we will 
 update this privacy policy and will notify you of the update by email 
 and/or through a notice on our website at least 30 days prior to their 
 implementation, and you will have the opportunity to opt-out of that 
 information sharing.
</p>

<p>
 Upromise may share with third parties, including nonaffiliated, 
 non-financial institutions, information that does not personally identify 
 individual members or visitors for any reason Upromise deems necessary or 
 desirable.

 Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Applications and Services
</h4>

<p>
 Some of our advertisements on third party Sites may use behavioral 
 information (such as how you navigate to the Sites and/or your activity 
 on our Sites) to provide relevant advertisements to you.  
 Upromise uses third party advertising partners that may use cookies, 
 other technologies and information about you: (i) to deliver these ads or other offers 
 from Upromise, our affiliates, our participating companies and others 
 on third party Sites, and (ii) to track the effectiveness of ads and other 
 offers Upromise delivers on third party websites. These companies are 
 authorized to use the information we provide and they collect when you 
 navigate to a Site within the advertising partner networks to provide this service to 
 Upromise. Each of the companies we work with participates in the 
 Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising 
 Alliance ("DAA"), or both. If you prefer not to receive these 
 targeted ads or offers as you visit or use these Sites, you may opt-out by clicking on 
 and following the directions contained in both the 
 <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices',440,400,false);return false;">NAI opt-out link</a> 
 and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('http://www.aboutads.info/choices',440,400,false);return false;">DAA opt-out link</a>. Please allow up to 10 days for the 
 opt-out to take effect. Please also 
 note that in order for the opt-out to work your browser must be set to 
 accept third party cookies. Furthermore, if you use a different 
 device, change web browsers or delete the opt-out cookie, you 
 will need to perform the opt-out task again. Please also note that if you choose to 
 opt-out from receiving these targeted advertisements, you may still see advertisements 
 while you're visiting or using third party Sites.  However, the advertisements you 
 see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
</p>

<p>
 We also may make third party applications available for you to download. The 
 information collected by third party application providers is governed by 
 their privacy policies unless otherwise stated. For example, the Upromise 
 RewardU Toolbar is provided by a third party on behalf of Upromise and is 
 subject to a separate privacy policy which can be accessed from the webpage 
 where you have the option to install the Upromise RewardU Toolbar application. 
 To learn more about the information collected by the Upromise RewardU Toolbar,
 including how it may be used and shared, please read the <a href="/member/rewardu/privacy.do" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('/member/rewardu/privacy.do',800,600,true);return false;">RewardU Privacy 
  Statement</a>.  In addition,the Upromise TurboSaver Toolbar 
 is provided by a third party on behalf of Upromise and is also subject to a
 separate privacy policy which can be accessed from the webpage where you have 
 the option to download the Upromise TurboSaver Toolbar application. To learn 
 more about the information collected by the Upromise TurboSaver Toolbar 
 including how it may be used and shared, please read the <a href="/member/turbosaver/privacy.do" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('/member/turbosaver/privacy.do',800,600,true);return false;">TurboSaver Privacy Statement</a>.
</p>

<h4 class="extraBotPad">
 Your Choice to Limit Affiliate Marketing
</h4>

<p>
 Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all marketing from 
 Upromise affiliates. Specifically, you may limit all Upromise affiliates 
 from marketing their products or services to you based on certain of 
 your personal information that they receive from Upromise. This 
 information includes your income, your account history, and your 
 credit score, in each case to the extent Upromise possesses such 
 information and has used it, or permitted a third party to use it, 
 for credit eligibility purposes. Your choice to limit marketing offers 
 from all Upromise affiliates based on such information will apply for 
 at least 5 years from when you tell us your choice. Before your choice to 
 limit marketing expires, you will receive a renewal notice that will 
 allow you to continue to limit such marketing offers from all Upromise 
 affiliates for at least another 5 years. If you have already made a choice 
 to limit marketing offers from Upromise affiliates based on the above 
 information, you do not need to act again until you receive the renewal 
 notice. If you wish to limit marketing by Upromise affiliated companies 
 as described in this paragraph, you may do so by clicking on this 
 <a href="/secure/affiliate/sharing/optOut.do" target="_blank" onclick="popWin('/secure/affiliate/sharing/optOut.do',800,600,true);return false;">link</a> and 
 providing the requested information. Your choice to limit marketing offers 
 will not apply in certain circumstances as provided under applicable law, 
 such as when you have an account with the Upromise affiliate that is 
 marketing to you.
</p>

<h4 class="extraBotPad">
 Security of Your Personal Information
</h4>

<p>
 Upromise is committed to earning and keeping your trust. We understand 
 the need for our members' personal information to remain secure and private. 
 To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we 
 use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include 
 computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. Further, only Upromise 
 employees who have a business need to access your personal information are 
 authorized to do so. No method of transmission over the internet nor 
 any method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot 
 guarantee absolute security over your personal information.
</p>

<p>
 Please remember that you also play a valuable part in data security. 
 You should never share your Upromise password with anyone. If you feel 
 your password has been compromised, you should change it immediately. 
 After you have finished using our site or applications, you should log
 out of your Upromise account and exit your browser so that no unauthorized 
 persons can use our site under your name and account.
</p>

<h4 class="extraBotPad">
 How can I access and update my Upromise data?
</h4>

<p>
 You may access and update information stored in your account profile by 
 visiting the Upromise site. Please keep your contact, account, and 
 preference information up-to-date. Doing so ensures that your 
 contributions are properly tracked and received. It also helps us inform 
 you of Upromise savings or other opportunities.
</p>

<p>
 We will retain your information for as long as you are a Upromise member 
 and/or we reasonably deem it necessary to provide you services, comply 
 with our legal or other obligations, resolve potential disputes, audit 
 our records and/or enforce our rights and obligations under our agreements. 
 If you no longer want us to use your information to provide you services, 
 you may terminate your Upromise membership.
</p>

<h4 class="extraBotPad">
 State Laws
</h4>

<p>
 In addition to the rights described in this policy, please note that you 
 may have additional rights under state law. For example, for accounts with 
 a California mailing address, we will not share your personal information 
 with a financial company for joint marketing purposes except as required 
 or permitted by law. In addition, for accounts with a Vermont mailing 
 address, 1) we will not share your consumer report information with our 
 affiliates except as required or permitted by law, and 2) for joint 
 marketing with other financial companies, we will only disclose your 
 name, contact information and information about your transactions 
 unless otherwise required or permitted by law.
