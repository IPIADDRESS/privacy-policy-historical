The privacy policy below details the measures taken by Univesal Uclick to protect your privacy in connection with your use of <a href="http://GoComics.com" target="_blank">www.GoComics.com</a>, <a href="http://ThePuzzleSociety.com" target="_blank">www.ThePuzzleSociety.com</a> and other sites or applications owned and operated by Universal Uclick, ("Sites"). Universal Uclick does not intend to collect any personal information from children under 13 unless Universal Uclick believes such collection to be permitted by law; please read below for Universal Uclick's policy with respect to children under 13.</p><h2>How is my personally identifiable information used by Universal Uclick?</h2><p>Universal Uclick is the sole owner of the information collected from the Universal Uclick service. Your Personal Information can only be collected when you voluntarily provide it.</p><h3>What is "Personal Information"?</h3><p>Personal Information is individually identifiable information about a person. This information can include a first and last name, credit card number, a home, billing or email address or a personal identifier that reveals an individual's email address, or a telephone or social security number. Personal information also includes a persistent identifier, such as a customer number held in a cookie (See below for definition of "cookie"), where such identifier is associated with individually identifiable information.</p><h3>Customized Experience.</h3><p>Universal Uclick gathers user information to provide you with a customized experience on our sites and other services. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of our site, register for free services, order products, enter contests or subscribe to a newsletter. If you choose not to register, you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.</p><h3>Subscription Services.</h3><p>If you subscribe to our site(s) for premium content services, Universal Uclick will gather user information and personal information to grant you access to the site(s). Universal Uclick may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for subscriptions, merchandise and products. If you choose not to register you may not have access to subscription areas that require personal identification.</p><h3>Email Delivery.</h3><p>If you register with our site(s) for daily email delivery, subscription services or purchase products from us, from time to time, we may email you with informative messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information.

We will combine that information to other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized email communications to you.</p><h3>Mobile Messaging.</h3><p>Universal Uclick might gather some personal information specific to participating in mobile messaging programs. The information requested may include contact, mobile phone numbers, carriers, and models for product delivery, and demographic information.</p><h2>When does uclick collect my information, including personally identifiable information?</h2><h3>Free Registration.</h3><p>When you register, Universal Uclick asks for your email address, a user selected user name, and other information.

Universal Uclick maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your Personal Information. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of information between your PC and our computers. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take great care to protect your Personal Information, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p><p>We also take precautions to protect your Personal Information off-line. Access to all user information is restricted. Only our employees, agents and processors whose jobs require accessing users' Personal Information are granted database access or administrator-level accounts on servers that contain such Personal Information. Finally, all servers containing users' Personal Information are kept locked in a secure data center and require a secure login to access them remotely.</p><p>Remember to sign off our Site and close your browser window when you are finished using it. This is to ensure that others cannot pose as you online. This is especially important if you are at a terminal that is accessible to others, such as the library, at school, at the workplace or at an Internet cafÃ©.</p><h3>Security.</h3><p>Universal Uclick has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. We use thawte SSL Web Server Certificates to offer secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site. Thawte has checked and verified the company registration documents and the site's registered domain name.
