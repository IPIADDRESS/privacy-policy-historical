	<p>Your privacy is important to us and UP is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. For that reason, we have established this Privacy Policy. Any personal information provided by customers/visitors to the Union Pacific Railroad Web site is used for internal purposes only. Union Pacific does not plan to divulge, sell or lease any personal information, customer listings, or aggregate data gathered through the UP site to any outside party. To make our policy easy to find, we make it accessible from every page of our site.</p>

					<p class="SectionHead">Information Collected and How We Use It </p>
				
		
	
			
		
	


	<p>We collect two types of information about visitors:</p>

<p><b>Personal and Company information</b>, which you have voluntarily submitted to us, (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, social security numbers, credit card numbers, or credit information), with MyUPRR registration, Bidder's List Registration, or through e-mail with our offices; and</p>

<p><b>Aggregate information</b>, automatically collected non-identifying statistics, (such as information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages they access, etc.) Our Web servers collect the IP addresses of visitors, not the e-mail addresses. UP uses this information to measure the use of our site, to improve the content of our site, and to monitor access for security purposes.</p>

<p>In general, you can visit our Web site without telling us who you are, or revealing personal information about yourself. However, Customers can, if they choose, participate in additional secured applications. For access to these applications, you are required to complete a registration form. This form includes information such as name, address, phone number and e-mail address, as well as company related information. We use this information to enhance our services, to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers, and to enhance the security of the UP site. We may also from time to time, send information to registered Customers about system changes or new applications that we think may be of interest.</p>

<p>Social Security Numbers and/or Credit Card Numbers submitted to us as part of an employment application or Photo Gallery Order are transmitted in an encrypted format. This information is not used outside of UP for any purpose other than that for which it was originally intended.</p>

					<p class="SectionHead">Registered User Access</p>
				
		
	
			
		
	


	Customers who have registered to access secured information and applications agree to abide by the confidentiality guidelines and policies of UP's <a href="security.shtml">Web Site Security Policy</a>. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="SectionHead">Links to Other Sites</p>
				
		
	
			
		
	


	<p>UP provides links to its parent company, the Union Pacific Corporation, as well as its <a href="up-sites.shtml">subsidiaries</a>. We also link to a number of third-party external sites. The inclusion of any link does not imply UP endorsement of the external site company, its Web site, or the products and services it promotes or sells. When you leave the UP site to visit one of these linked sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from UPRR.com (the "refer address").</p>

<p>UP is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of these third party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at these sites to determine how your information may be used.</p>

<p><b>For those seeking employment</b>, it is important to note that all job posting and application information is processed through the Applied Information Management (AIM) Institute which provides one-stop processing for career opportunities on behalf of business and industry. Through AIM, UP reaches a broader applicant pool, posts openings, and processes responses more quickly. Your personal application information is encrypted for its transferal to AIM, and again when AIM sends the information to UP.</p>

	<p>A cookie is a very small text file that a Web page server sends to your hard drive, in response to your browser's request for a Web page. The purpose of the cookie is to help a Web site's server recognize a user. Sites with secured information use cookies to help recognize user IDs, or on our site, to help users navigate between secured and unsecured information. Cookies also help Web site managers track which information on their site is most useful and most often accessed, and which pages are seldom visited. The cookie for our site, recognizable only to our server, simply helps to identify you and tell us which information you wish to read, and which you don't.</p>

<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but they can be configured to not accept them, or to indicate whenever a cookie is being sent.</p>

	<p>UP is committed to online data security, and for that reason we take steps to make all information received from you online as secure as reasonably possible from unauthorized access and use.</p>

	<p>Registered users of MyUPRR can access the personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain, by clicking on the Customer link under "My Profile" at MyUPRR. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes.</p>

<p>Inquiries submitted via "Feedback," sent via e-mail, or sent using the Webmaster link, are processed and responded to as soon as possible. If there is a need to access or update a past e-mail, please direct inquiries to <a href="mailto:&quot;webmaster@up.com&quot;">Webmaster@up.com</a></p>

<p>Credit card information, submitted for Photo Gallery orders, is not maintained beyond the time period necessary for order processing.</p>

<p>Applicants who wish to amend information submitted with a job application, or Suppliers needing to change Bidder's Registration information, may direct inquiries to the <a href="mailto:&quot;webmaster@up.com&quot;">Webmaster@up.com</a></p>

	<p>While we do not direct any of the information on our site specifically to children, we are very proud of our Facts, Figures and History pages and the information they provide for students and railfans alike. We believe that protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important, and for that reason it is our intention to never collect or maintain information from children at our Web site.</p>
