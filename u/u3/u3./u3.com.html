      <p>At U3 LLC (“U3”), we believe it is important to protect the privacy of our customers and guests. We know that you care about how your personal information is collected, updated, used and shared; and we want to help you make knowledgeable choices about the information you provide to us.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains and summarizes how we collect, use and protect your personal information as you interact with us online and through our customer and technical support services, if any.</p>
      <p>If you are visiting from outside the United States there may be special rules or limitations on your use of this web site. Click here <a href="#eu">U3 EUROPEAN UNION COOKIE &amp; PRIVACY NOTICE</a> for details.</p>
      <p>This policy explains: 
		</p><ul>
			<li>What information U3 gathers from you.</li> 
			<li>How U3 uses the personal information you share with us and that we learn about you because of our relationship.</li> 
			<li>How U3 uses "cookies" and "IP Addresses".</li> 
			<li>What personal information, if any, U3 may share about you and the conditions we use to protect your information if it must be shared.</li> 
			<li>U3’s efforts to respect the privacy of international visitors and customers and where you can find additional information relating to privacy and cookies if you are an international visitor or customer.</li>

		<div id="linespace6"><b>COLLECTED INFORMATION AND USAGE</b>
</div>
U3 collects and uses information you provide to us or that we learn from your use of this web site. We are not in the business of selling information about you. U3 does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may share your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. Whenever we may need to share your personal information, we try to provide you with the information you need to make informed reasonable choices. 
<br><br>
U3 collects and uses personal information from you in several ways: 
<ul>

<li><b>Web Site Usage.</b> U3, or U3 authorized service providers, may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) relating to your use of this web site. While we may collect or log this information, we generally do not identify you or match this information with your other personal information. We may use this collected or logged information to diagnose web site technical problems, or to facilitate your use of the site. U3, or one of our authorized service providers, also may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout this web site. EU visitors should refer to <a href="#eu">U3’s European Union Cookie &amp; Privacy Notice</a> for a more complete cookie explanation as the use of cookies and related technologies may be understood differently in the EU.  

</li><li><b>Online Transactions.</b> If we offer you the opportunity to purchase products online and you choose to purchase such products, you may be asked to share personal information in order to complete a transaction. When you purchase a product online you may be asked for information needed to complete your order, contact you to confirm the order and, provide related customer service. This information is used, for example, to effect your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and U3 and/or our authorized service providers. 

</li><li><b>Product Registration &amp; Technical Support.</b> If we offer you the opportunity to purchase products online and you choose to purchase such products, we may allow all purchasers of our products to register their products online. Personal information or data provided via online product registration forms is used to carry out the request, service or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the web site (such as a change to this privacy policy or notice of a security breach), new U3 products and services, and special offers and contests that may be of interest to you. When you register, we ask for, among other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased and serial number or other product-identifying information, and date of purchase. 
<br><br>
Where you provide optional information, such as information about your interests and hobbies, U3 only uses this information on an aggregate basis to enable us to better understand our customers, develop new products, and improve our products and services. U3 limits the access of our service providers and vendors who assist with product registration, technical support and customer service through the use of confidentiality provisions and agreements that are intended to enforce this privacy policy.
<br><br>

We do not share product registration information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
<br><br>
Failure to register your product will not diminish the rights you have under any product warranty.
<br><br>
If and whenever you want to modify how we use your personal information or, if you prefer that we deactivate your personal information so that it is not readily accessible or usable, we will do our best to accommodate you. Click <a href="mailto:info@u3.com">here</a> for instructions. 

</li><li><b>Recruitment and Job Applications.</b> You may provide us with personal information, such as that contained on a resume or a curriculum vitae, in connection with a job application or inquiry. We may use this information throughout U3 (worldwide) for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. We may keep your information on file for future consideration. EU applicants should consult <a href="#eu">U3’s European Union Cookie &amp; Privacy Notice</a> for additional information.

</li><li><b>Children.</b> Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to U3. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of the U3 web site, and we learn the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties. 


</li><li><b>Public Areas.</b> Any information disclosed in public areas of the U3 web site will become public information. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as bulletin boards, developer’s forums and chat rooms. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing your personal information. 

</li><li><b>Non-Public Areas.</b>  We will ask you to provide personal information through a registration form before providing you access to restricted areas of the web site.  Regardless of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, we will permanently store any personal information provided by You via such registration form.
</li></ul>
<b>
USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION
</b>
<ul>
<li><b>U3 Service Suppliers.</b>  U3 may work with some authorized service providers to provide technical and customer support, shipping, credit card processing, product fulfillment or other services. Where practical, U3 shall require these service providers to safeguard personal information you provide to us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to U3, these third parties may have access to or process your personal information. U3 generally limits their use of your personal information to the purpose for which it was shared. U3 may sometimes permit our authorized service providers to have access to aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information. 

</li><li><b>Mergers, Acquisitions and Bankruptcy.</b> If U3 should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if U3 should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of its business, U3 may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers. It is U3’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information disclosed or received in these types of transactions.


</li><li><b>As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.</b> U3 may be required to disclose your personal information if it: (i) believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property; or (iv) is necessary protect the interest of other users of our web site.
</li></ul>
<b>

Privacy laws differ across the globe.

If it is necessary for the purposes for which you have shared personal information with us for us to share your information within U3’s global operations, we will do so consistent with this policy.

   <br><br>
To help you understand the U3 Privacy Policy and to educate you about EU specific components of our policy, U3 provides this supplemental EU Cookie &amp; Privacy Notice. This Notice further explains how the U3 Privacy Policy applies to EU customers and web site visitors.
<br><br>

This Notice does not apply to non-EU customers and non-EU web site visitors.
<br><br>
<b>USE OF U.S. WEB SITE AND U.S. DATA PROCESSING</b>
<br><br>
Any personal data collected about EU visitors via this web site or when you contact U3’s customer or technical support will be processed in the United States by U3 or a party acting on its behalf.
<br><br>
U3 is the responsible party for the processing of your personal data although the goal of our policy is to give you control over your personal data.
<br><br>
When you provide personal data to U3, you consent to the processing of your data in the United States as this web site is operated in the United States.
<br><br>
<b>SAFE HARBOR CERTIFICATION</b>
<br><br>
U3 adheres to the Safe Harbor principles negotiated between the United States and the EU regarding data protection with regard to customer data and personal data U3 receives when providing technical and customer support. Accordingly, when visiting this web site or providing personal data to U3 through our technical or customer support, U3 has taken steps to ensure the adequate protection of the processing of your personal data.
<br><br>

<b>EU COOKIE POLICY</b>
<br><br>
