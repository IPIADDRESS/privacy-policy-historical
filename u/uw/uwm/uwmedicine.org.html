Certain individuals or offices within the University of Washington provide support functions to UW Medicine that might include the use of health information. For example, the University provides risk management and information system support services to UW Medicine entities. When providing these support services, University staff maintain and protect the confidentiality of your health information.</p>
<p><strong>SCCA.</strong> SCCA is a separate cancer care hospital providing inpatient services at its hospital located within University of Washington Medical Center and outpatient services at the SCCA's separately located outpatient clinic. SCCA operates jointly with UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), and Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (Children's) to provide both inpatient and outpatient cancer care to the community.

<h2><a id="phi" name="phi">Protected Health Information</a></h2>
<p>This Notice applies to health information – created or received by the Providers at UW Medicine or SCCA facilities – that identifies you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental condition, the care provided or the past, present or future payment for your health care. This information, often contained in your health or medical record, among other purposes, serves as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to your care; 
</li><li>The legal record describing the care you received; 
</li><li>A means by which you or a third-party payer can verify that services billed were actually provided; 
</li><li>A tool in educating health professionals; 
</li><li>A source of data for medical research; 
</li><li>A source of information for public health officials; 
</li><li>A source of data for facility planning; and 
</li><li>A tool we use to monitor, evaluate and continually work to improve the care we render and the outcomes we achieve.</li></ul>
<p>Understanding what is in your record and how your health information is used and disclosed helps you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure accuracy in the record; 
</li><li>Better understand who, what, when, where, and why others may access your health information; and 
</li><li>Make a more informed decision when authorizing disclosures to others.</li></ul>

<h2><a id="phi2" name="phi2">Use and Disclosure of Your Protected Health Information Without Your Authorization</a></h2>
<p>Here are some examples of how we may use and disclose protected health information without your authorization. </p>
<p><strong>Treatment.</strong> We use and disclose your health information to provide treatment. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your physician uses your information to determine whether specific diagnostic tests, therapies, and medications should be ordered. 
</li><li>Nurses, technicians, students, or other personnel may need to know and/or discuss your health problems to carry out treatment and to understand how to evaluate your response to treatment. 
</li><li>We may disclose your health information to another one of your treatment providers in the community, unless the provider is not currently providing treatment to you and you direct us in writing not to make the disclosure.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Payment.</strong> We may use your health information for payment purposes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may use your information to prepare claims for payment for services. 
</li><li>If you have health insurance and we bill your insurance directly, we will have to include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, procedures, and supplies used so that we can be compensated for the treatment provided. However, we will not disclose your health information to a third-party payor without your authorization except when allowed by law.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Health Care Operations.</strong> We may use and disclose your health information to carry out health care operations. For example, we use and disclose health information from patients to monitor and improve our health services. Also, authorized staff may look at portions of your record to perform administrative activities. </p>
<p><strong>Train Staff and Students.</strong> We may use and disclose your information to teach and train staff and students. One example of this is when teaching physicians review patient health information with medical students.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct Research.</strong> We may use and disclose your information for research. An Institutional Review Board will review each request to use or disclose your information for research. This is a Board that reviews research at UW Medicine or SCCA to make sure that projects are as safe as possible. In some cases, your health care information might be used or disclosed for research without your consent. For example, a researcher might: review medical charts to see if wearing a bicycle helmet was a factor in how serious bicycle injuries are; or to determine if we have enough patients to conduct a cancer research study; or to include your information in a research data base. In these cases, the Institutional Review Board makes sure that using your information without your consent is justified and that steps are taken to limit the use of your information. In all other cases, we must obtain your authorization to use or disclose your information for a research project. We may share information about you used for research with researchers at other institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Contact You for Information.</strong> Your health information may also be used to contact you (for example, by calling you or sending you a letter) to remind you about appointments, to provide diagnostic results, to inform you about important treatment alternatives, or to advise you about other health-related benefits and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct Fundraising.</strong> The Providers, other than SCCA, may use information such as your name, address, phone number, and the dates you received services at UW Medicine to contact you for UW Medicine fundraising activities or fundraising activities related to the Providers’ individual or joint operations. We raise funds to expand and support health care services, educational programs, and research activities related to curing disease. We will not sell, trade, or loan your information to any third parties but the Providers may share your protected health information with third parties working directly for one of the Providers. If you do not wish to be contacted as part of our fundraising efforts, please notify us in writing at </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>UW Medicine Privacy Office, <br>Box 359210, <br>Seattle, WA 98195</p></blockquote>
<p>SCCA does not engage in fundraising but their parent organizations (Children’s, FHCRC, and UW Medicine) may occasionally contact patients to solicit funds to expand and support important cancer-related health care services, educational programs, and research activities. The SCCA privacy officer can help you if you do not wish to be contacted. </p>
<p><strong>Joint Activities.</strong> Your health information may be used and shared by the Providers in furtherance of their joint activities and with other individuals or organizations that engage in joint treatment, payment or health care operational activities with the Providers. </p>
<p><strong>Business Associates.</strong> Your health information may be used by the Providers and disclosed to individuals or organizations that assist the Providers with their treatment, payment and health care operations or with complying with their legal obligations to use and disclose your information as described in this Notice. For example, we may disclose information to consultants or attorneys who assist us in our business activities. These business associates must agree to protect the confidentiality of your information.</p>
<p><strong>Other Uses and Disclosures.</strong> We also use and disclose your information to enhance health care services, to protect patient safety, to safeguard public health, to ensure that our facilities and practitioners comply with government and accreditation standards and when otherwise allowed by law. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We provide information regarding FDA regulated drugs and devices to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; 
</li><li>We provide government oversight agencies with data for health oversight activities such as auditing or licensure; 
</li><li>We provide public health authorities with information on communicable diseases and vital records; 
</li><li>We provide information to Workers’ Compensation agencies and self-insured employers for work-related illness or injuries; 
</li><li>We provide information to appropriate government agencies when we suspect abuse or neglect; 
</li><li>We provide notice to appropriate individuals when we believe it necessary to avoid a serious threat to health or safety or to prevent serious harm to an individual; 
</li><li>We provide information to organ procurement organizations to coordinate organ donation activities; 
</li><li>We provide information to law enforcement when required or allowed by law; 
</li><li>We disclose information pursuant to court order or lawful subpoena; 
</li><li>We provide information to coroners, medical examiners and funeral directors; 
</li><li>We provide information to government officials when required for specifically identified government functions such as national security; and
