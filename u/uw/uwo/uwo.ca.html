        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the official Web site of the Privacy Office                        at The University of Western Ontario.<br>
          <br>
          This site contains information about Western’s privacy                        protection strategy and initiatives. As it evolves, it                        will provide specific guidance to faculty and staff who                        collect, use and disclose personal information on behalf                        of the University in the course of their authorized activities.                        It will also enable anyone whose personal information is                        maintained by Western to learn more about what steps are                        being taken to protect his or her privacy.<br>
          <br>
          As noted in the Overview, in its effort to continue to                        protect the personal information of all individuals who                        come into contact with the University, Western has chosen                        to adopt a broadly based ‘privacy protection’ strategy.                        Rather than focusing exclusively on the specific requirements                        of new federal privacy legislation, our goal at Western                        is to ensure that all personal information is dealt with                        appropriately.<br>
          <br>
          If you have any questions or concerns about Western’s                        approach to protecting personal information please visit                        the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page or contact us                        directly. Contact information is provided elsewhere on                        this site.<br>
          <br>
          I look forward to working with members of Western’s                        community to ensure that we continue to protect the personal                        information that is entrusted to our care. <br>
          <br>
Sincerely,</p>
        <p><strong>Robin Keirstead</strong><br>
