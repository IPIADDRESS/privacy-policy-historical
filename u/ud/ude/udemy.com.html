Our policies may differ from other service offerings and you should carefully review the terms of service and this privacy notice before using these services.</p> 
			
			<h2>Collected Information</h2> 
			<p>In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.

			<p>We are committed to protecting children's privacy online and meeting the requirements of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. This Site is intended for users above the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. </p> 
			
			<h2>Billing</h2> 
			<p>If you use or provide services on the Site for which we implement a billing system for you, we will collect additional information from you so that we can process and collect billing information.

			<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site.</p> 
			
			<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by our Site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p>
