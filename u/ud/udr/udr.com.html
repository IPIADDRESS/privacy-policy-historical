Our collection of Personally Identifiable Information and Tracking Data is described in more detail&nbsp;below.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>Personally Identifiable Information. You do not have to provide Personally Identifiable Information to use the Site. However, your use of particular services made available through the Site may require us to collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. We collect such Personally Identifiable Information only when you affirmatively provide it to us — for example, when completing forms online, such as those forms available through our <em>“Contact&nbsp;Community”</em> feature, or when answering surveys. You may be asked to provide your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers, and/or email address), financial information (such as income level and credit card number), and demographic information (such as your age or ZIP code) in connection with your use of such services. Remember that no Personally Identifiable Information is actually submitted through the Site until you click the <em>“SUBMIT”</em> or similar button on the form into which you have entered such&nbsp;information.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>The Site offers you the opportunity to email web pages from the Site to any email address of your choice. To offer you this feature, we need to ask you for both your email address, and the email address of the person to whom you wish to send the applicable page. We do not store this information or use it for any purpose other than to email the web page to its intended&nbsp;recipient.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and reserve the right to use your email address, and any information you provide in your message, to respond&nbsp;thereto.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>Tracking Data. Tracking Data consists of non-personally-identifiable information we collect automatically from each Visitor, such as browser type, operating system, Internet service provider, IP address, and referring page or site. Tracking Data may include information such as the pages you visit and features you use, the total number of your Site or page visits, your search terms, and the average time you spend on a page or area of the Site. Collecting Tracking Data is a standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We may combine the Tracking Data we collect from you with your Personally Identifiable Information and use the combined information for customer research and marketing purposes, such as to identify which Site users we think are most likely to rent a property in the near-term. We may share the results of that research with third parties, but we will not share the combined information with any third party for its own marketing or other&nbsp;use.</p>                                                                                                                          <h3 class="policy-section-title">How Does UDR,&nbsp;Inc.

Some of the most important of the Site's features require us to share your Personally Identifiable Information with <em>“Communities”</em>—that is, third party real estate properties about which information is provided on the Site. When you provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site as part of a <em>“Contact&nbsp;Community”</em> or similar form, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information with those Communities with which you have authorized us to share such information. By entering your Personally Identifiable Information in this context and clicking the <em>“SUBMIT”</em> or similar button, you are authorizing us to share your Personally Identifiable Information, as well as the identity of the last promotional item you viewed on the Site, in this manner. These Communities may use the information you have authorized us to share to contact you about properties that are available or other matters. We may also email you to indicate that your information has been forwarded to such Communities. Please be advised that we do not monitor or control Communities' use or disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information. When you provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site as part of a <em>“Lease&nbsp;Online”</em> form, that Personally Identifiable Information is not stored on or transmitted through UDR,&nbsp;Inc.'s servers. Rather, UDR,&nbsp;Inc. has contracted with a third party service provider to capture such information, encrypt it, and transmit it to the Communities of your choice. By entering your Personally Identifiable Information in this context and clicking the <em>“SUBMIT”</em> or similar button, you are authorizing the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information in this manner.

UDR,&nbsp;Inc. works with third parties who provide services that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, website hosting, data analysis, email services, and other services of an administrative or technical nature. UDR,&nbsp;Inc. reserves the right to share Personally Identifiable Information with such third parties for the purpose of providing such&nbsp;services.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>Disclosure of Tracking Data. UDR,&nbsp;Inc. uses Tracking Data to create aggregate reports on Visitor demographics, Site traffic patterns and user behavior, and may provide these reports to advertisers and other third parties. None of the foregoing information that we may provide to such advertisers or third parties is personally identifiable — that is, can be connected by such advertisers or third parties to the Personally Identifiable Information supplied to UDR,&nbsp;Inc. by individual&nbsp;Visitors.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>Use of Email Addresses In Sending Notices Regarding the Site and Our Policies. From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may email information regarding the use of the Site or its services, or changes to our Terms of Service or this Policy, to Visitors who have provided us with their respective email addresses, whether through a specific Site service, an email link, or otherwise. Visitors may not <em>“opt&nbsp;out”</em> of receiving these&nbsp;emails.</p>                                                                                                                          <p>Other Disclosures. Finally, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, UDR,&nbsp;Inc. reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information about our Visitors or other users to third parties under any of the following circumstances: when we believe in good faith that the law permits it (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena); to our legal advisors; to enforce our Terms of Service; to protect the rights, property, safety or security of UDR,&nbsp;Inc., our Visitors, or the public; or to respond to an&nbsp;emergency.</p>                                                                                                                          <h3 class="policy-section-title">Other Important Notes Regarding&nbsp;Privacy.</h3>                                                                                                                          <p>Security.

Unfortunately, no security system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

UDR, Inc. reserves the right to use Google Analytics’ third-party audience data to better understand the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences.

These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
