			<p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:privacy@unsubcentral.com">privacy@unsubcentral.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or it is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through the <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process</a>.

			<h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
			<p>UnsubCentral, Inc. ("UnsubCentral", "we", "our" or "us") has created this privacy policy in order to disclose our use of consumer data collected about you ("you" or "your"). Any questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@unsubcentral.com">privacy@unsubcentral.com</a>. You may also contact UnsubCentral at 701 Brazos, Ste 800, Austin, TX 78701. Please see the Opt Out section below for instructions on unsubscribing via postal mail. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for UnsubCentral's marketing website. Use of the UnsubCentral suppression service shall be governed by the services agreement between UnsubCentral and the appropriate third party and our privacy practices for client data as described below.</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle">Information Collected and Received</h2>
			<p>UnsubCentral may collect or receive information about individuals who are members of suppression lists of third parties, which may include, but is not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, credit card information, street address, gender, occupation, and interests. We also collect information on the pages users access or visit, and other information volunteered by users, such as survey information. Additionally, for each visitor to our web page, our server automatically recognizes standard Web log information like IP Addresses and referring URLs. Log file information is tied to personally identifiable information to prevent fraud and to customize the site.</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle">Uses of Information</h2>
			<p>The information UnsubCentral collects and receives is used to provide our proprietary suppression services, improve the content of our website; to notify consumers about updates to our website; to contact our corporate users for marketing purposes if they elect to continue to receive such communications; and as otherwise may be necessary for UnsubCentral to provide requested services to users and visitors to the site. UnsubCentral does not share the information with unauthorized parties. For example, we have authorized a company to process credit card information collected through our site on our behalf. They are not permitted to use your information for any secondary purposes.</p>
			
			<p>Information provided to UnsubCentral in any manner may be disclosed if disclosed in response to a valid order of a court or authorized agency of government.</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle">Security</h2>
			<p>We use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between us and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle">Cookies</h2>
			<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your session, shopping cart and to make sure you do not see the same advertising repeatedly. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password.</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle">Links</h2>
			<p>We may create links to other web sites. We will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated or authorized by us may have links leading to our site. We cannot control these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.</p>
			
			<h2 class="subtitle">Amendments</h2>
			<p>We may amend this policy at any time. The amended terms that are minor shall automatically be effective upon being posted on our site. If, however, we are going to use personally identifiable information collected through our corporate site (not our application-we do not use client data for any secondary purposes) in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days. This Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing that specifically refers to this policy and is physically signed by both parties.</p>
