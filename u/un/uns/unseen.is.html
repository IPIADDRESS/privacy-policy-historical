                        <p>Unseen, efh. (“Unseen,”  “we,” “our,” or “us”) offers a secure messaging service (the “Service”). Unseen  is committed to protecting the privacy of any personally identifiable  information that Unseen may collect from you when you use the website at  www.unseen.is (the “Website”) or the Service. This notice sets forth Unseen’s  Privacy Policy. By accessing, using or registering at the Website or using the Service  you are confirming your agreement to the terms of the this Privacy Policy. You  also should review the Unseen Terms of Service for more information about the  policies governing your use of the Website and Service.</p>
                        <p>1.&nbsp; THE SERVICE.&nbsp; Unseen’s Service encrypts your email messages  using encryption keys that are themselves encrypted based on your  passphrase.&nbsp; Only you know your  passphrase. The Service transmits and stores your email messages, but Unseen  and its personnel cannot decrypt these email messages because to do so your  passphrase is needed but is not available.&nbsp;  Upon a lawful demand by a court or other governmental authority, Unseen  may be required to provide your encrypted email message files and your  encrypted keys. Unseen, however, does not have access to your passphrase and thus  is unable to provide it.</p>
                        <p>2.&nbsp; INFORMATION COLLECTED.&nbsp; Unseen in good faith will keep the information we collect from you at the minimum necessary  to provide you the Service. Use of the Service requires that when you register  you share with Unseen your email address, telephone number and other personal  identifying information. Unseen also collects and stores personal  identifying information when you pay for the premium Service. The personal  identifying information collected for the payment transaction may include your  name, address, telephone number, credit card number and credit card security  code.</p>
                        <p>We also may automatically collect  and store certain types of non-personal identifying information when you visit  the Website and use the Service. For example, we may use “cookies” to obtain  information when you access this website. Such information may include your internet  protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the date and time of your visit, your  hardware type and model, your device identifier, the operating system of your  computer, network information, and the domain name of your internet service  provider. This information is used to facilitate access to and improve the Website  and Service and to provide the Service.</p>
                        <p>3.&nbsp; USE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.&nbsp; All personal identifying information, such as  email address, phone number or other personal identifying information, provided  to Unseen by you is private and will be used only (a) to provide the Service, (b)  to provide you notices about the Service, (c) to process your payments, (d) to  validate your email address or phone number, and (e) if you grant Unseen  permission, to link Unseen users with each other. Unseen shall not otherwise sell  or disclose your personal identifying information to any third party unless  required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is  necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on  Unseen, or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Unseen. If Unseen  shares personal identifying information with a third party, such as a credit  card processing company, Unseen will, to the extent practical, require that the  recipient protect such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy  Policy, but Unseen cannot guarantee how such a third party will use personal  identifying information. </p>
                        <p>Unseen also may use non-personal  identifying summary or aggregate information that Unseen collects to improve  the Website and Service. Personal identifying information that you provide is  an asset of Unseen which may be included in assets transferred to an acquirer  if Unseen is acquired by a third party.</p>
                        <p>At any time, you may choose  to no longer receive emails from Unseen by contacting us at support@unseen.is.</p>
                        <p>It is Unseen's policy to respect  the privacy of all users, but we cannot guarantee that user information will  not be disclosed.</p>
                        <p>4. EMAIL MESSAGES AND KEYS.&nbsp;  Unseen has access to and stores only your encrypted email messages and  your encrypted encryption keys. Because the encryption is based on your  passphrase, to which we do not have access, Unseen cannot unencrypt your email  messages.</p>
                        <p>5.&nbsp; LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES.&nbsp; We provide links to websites of third parties  as a service to users of our Website. We cannot control and are not responsible  for the information collection and privacy practices of such third-party websites,  which may differ from the privacy policies of Unseen.</p>
                        <p>6.&nbsp; Access  to and Correction of Personal Information.&nbsp;  By following the instructions on the Website, you may access,  correct, update, and/or delete any personal identifying information that you  have provided to Unseen through the Website and you may unsubscribe from the  Service.</p>
                        <p>7.&nbsp; DISCLAIMER.&nbsp;  Unseen has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and  operational security in order to protect personal identifying information from  loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorized Unseen personnel are  provided access to personal identifying information, and such personnel are  required to treat such information as confidential. Despite these precautions,  Unseen cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to  your personal identifying information.</p>
                        <p>8.&nbsp; Children’s On-Line Privacy Protection.&nbsp; Unseen understands the  importance of protecting the privacy of children, especially in an on-line  environment. The Website is not intentionally designed for or directed at  children 13 years of age or younger, and Unseen will not intentionally collect  or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.</p>
                        <p>9.&nbsp; CONSENT, MODIFICATION.&nbsp; By using the Website, you consent to the  collection, use, and storage of your information by Unseen in the manner  described in this Privacy Policy. Your access to and registration on the  Website and use of the Service and any dispute with Unseen concerning privacy  will be subject to the provisions of the this Privacy Policy and the Unseen  Terms of Service. Unseen reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change,  modify, add, or remove portions of the this Privacy Policy at any time. Please  check this page periodically for changes. You agree that your use of the Website  and Service will be subject to and bound by the then-current version of the  Unseen Privacy Policy.</p>
