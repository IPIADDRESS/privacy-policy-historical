				<p align="center"><b>PLEASE NOTE 
				THAT OUR  PRIVACY POLICY has changed effective September 9, 2008.</b></p>
				<p><b>If you submitted personally 
				identifiable information to use prior to September 9, 2008, and desire 
				opt out of having that previously submitted personally identifiable 
				information from being treated under the new policy, please contact 
				us at <a href="mailto:legal@apartmenttherapy.com" target="_blank">legal@apartmenttherapy.com</a>.</b></p>

				<p>            Welcome to <a href="http://www.unplggd.com" target="_blank">unplggd.com</a>.  
				unplggd.com ("Website") is an interactive online service 
				operated by Apartment Therapy, LLC ("us", "we", or "our").   
				Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy, which 
				includes compliance with California Privacy Rights (see also <a href="http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov" target="_blank">http://www.privacyprotection.ca.gov</a>).  </p>
				<p>            We respect your privacy and are committed 
				to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us 
				through our Website.  We have adopted this Privacy Policy ("Privacy 
				Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, 
				how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose 
				the information to third parties.  This Privacy Policy applies 
				only to information we collect through our Website and does not apply 
				to our collection of information from other sources.  </p>
				<p>            This Privacy Policy, together with 
				the Terms of Use posted on our Website, sets forth the general rules 
				and policies governing your use of our Website.  Depending on your 
				activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to 
				additional terms and conditions.  </p>
				<p>            We generally keep this Privacy Policy 
				posted on our Website and you should review it frequently, as it may 
				change from time to time without notice.  Any changes will be effective 
				immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy.  WHEN 
				YOU ACCESS OUR WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU 
				DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY 
				MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE.  If, at any point, 
				we decide to use your personally identifiable information in a manner 
				materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected, 
				we will notify users of this change by e-mail to the last e-mail address 
				provided to us.  Users will have a choice (by means of an opt out 
				opportunity) as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
				manner.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
				policy under which the information was collected if you opt out of the 
				new policy.  </p>

				<ol type="A">
				  <li><b>INFORMATION 
				  WE COLLECT </b></li>
				</ol>
				<p>            Our Website typically collects two 
				kinds of information about you:  (a) information that you provide 
				that personally identifies you; and (b) information that does not personally 
				identify you, that we automatically collect when you visit our Website 
				or that you provide us.  </p>
				<ol><ol type="1">
				    <li>Personally Identifiable 
				    Information: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            Our definition of personally identifiable 
				information includes any information that may be used to specifically 
				identify or contact you, such as your name, mail address, phone number, 
				etc.  As a general policy, we do not automatically collect your 
				personally identifiable information when you visit our Website.  
				In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide 
				you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information 
				in connection with a feature, program, promotion or some other aspect 
				of our Website.  For instance, you may:  (a) provide your 
				name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone 
				number when registering with our Website, using our online store, or 
				in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain demographic 
				information about you (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference, usage 
				frequency, etc.) when participating in a survey, poll or joining a club; 
				or (c) post a product rating and recommendation on our Website.  
				Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing 
				alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information 
				(e.g., your age and name).  Whether or not you provide this information 
				is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information 
				is required to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit 
				we may offer, or gain access to certain content on our Website.  </p>

				<ol><ol type="1" start="2">
				    <li>Non-Personal Information: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            Our definition of non-personal information 
				is any information that does not personally identify you.  Non-personal 
				information can include certain personally identifiable information 
				that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered 
				anonymous.  We obtain non-personal information about you from information 
				that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally 
				identifiable information.  We also automatically collect certain 
				non-personal information from you when you access our Website.  
				This information can include, among other things, IP addresses, the 
				type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, 
				etc.), the third party website from which your visit originated, the 
				operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Macintosh OS, 
				etc.), the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America 
				Online, NetZero, etc.), the search terms you use on our Website, the 
				specific web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits.  </p>
				<ol type="A" start="2">
				  <li><b>HOW WE USE 
				  &amp; SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED </b></li>
				</ol>
				<ol><ol type="1">

				    <li>Personally Identifiable 
				    Information: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            The personally identifiable information 
				you submit to us is generally used to carry out your requests, respond 
				to your inquiries, better serve you, or in other ways naturally associated 
				with the circumstances in which you provided the information.  
				We may also use this information to later contact you for a variety 
				of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information 
				for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or other 
				affiliated companies ("affiliated companies"), or to communicate 
				with you about content or other information you have posted or shared 
				with us via our Website.  You may opt-out from receiving future 
				promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct 
				that we not share your information with any affiliated companies, as 
				set forth below.  </p>
				<p>            In certain instances we may also share 
				your personally identifiable information with our third party vendors 
				performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated companies) 
				— e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, 
				administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional assistance, 
				analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.  Our vendors 
				agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only 
				to carry out our requests.  In addition, we may share your personally 
				identifiable information with participating sponsors to a program or 
				promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Website, 
				and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information 
				you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production 
				companies we may use).  Further, we may share your personally identifiable 
				information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and 
				others with whom we have marketing or other relationships.  Except 
				as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth 
				when you submit the information, your personally identifiable information 
				will not be shared or sold to any third parties without your prior approval.  </p>
				<ol><ol type="1" start="2">
				    <li>Non-Personal Information: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            We use non-personal information in 
				a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic, understand 
				customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional activities, 
				and to improve our services.  We may use your non-personal information 
				by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from others.  
				We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated companies 
				and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but remember 
				that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not personally 
				identify you.  </p>

				<ol type="A" start="3">
				  <li><b>OTHER USES 
				  &amp; INFORMATION </b></li>
				</ol>
				<ol><ol type="1">
				    <li>IP Addresses: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            An IP address is a number that is automatically 
				assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet.  
				Web servers (computers that "serve up" web pages) automatically 
				identify your computer by its IP address.  When visitors request 
				pages from our Website, our servers typically log their IP addresses.  
				We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report 
				non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of 
				our Website.  IP addresses are considered non-personal information 
				and may also be shared as provided above.  It is not our practice 
				to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the 
				visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous 
				to us.  However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify 
				a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our 
				Website rules or to:  (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform 
				with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend 
				our legal rights or property, our Website, or other users; or (d) in 
				an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Website's users 
				or the general public.  </p>
				<ol><ol type="1" start="2">
				    <li>Cookies, etc.: </li>

				</ol></ol>
				<p>            "Cookies" are small text files 
				from a website that are stored on your hard drive.  These text 
				files make using our Website more convenient by, among other things, 
				saving your passwords and preferences for you.  Cookies themselves 
				do not typically contain any personally identifiable information.  
				We may analyze the information derived from these cookies and other 
				technological tools we employ (such as clear gifs/web beacons) and match 
				this information with data provided by you or another party.  We 
				may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third 
				parties (who may in turn use this information to provide advertisements 
				tailored to your interests), but this will not involve disclosing any 
				of your personally identifiable information.  Please note that 
				advertisers that serve advertisements on our Website may also use their 
				own cookies and other technological tools which are subject to the advertiser's 
				privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy.  </p>
				<p>            If you are concerned about the storage 
				and use of cookies, you may be able to direct your internet browser 
				to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to your 
				hard drive.  You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard 
				drive through your internet browser or other programs.  Please 
				note, however, that some parts of our Website will not function properly 
				or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to 
				disable the acceptance of cookies.  </p>
				<ol><ol type="1" start="3">
				    <li>Email Communications: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            If you send us an email with questions 
				or comments, we may use your personally identifiable information to 
				respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions 
				or comments for future reference.  For security reasons, we do 
				not recommend that you send non-public personal information, such as 
				passwords, social security numbers, or bank account information, to 
				us by email.  However, aside from our reply to such an email, it 
				is not our standard practice to send you email unless you request a 
				particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications, 
				it relates to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, 
				customer support, etc.), we are sending you information about our other 
				products and services, or you consented to being contacted by email 
				for a particular purpose.  In certain instances, we may provide 
				you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications 
				from us; that is, agree to some communications but not others.  
				You may "opt out" of receiving future commercial email communications 
				from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" link included at the bottom 
				of most emails we send, or as provided below; provided, however, we 
				reserve the right to send you transactional emails such as customer 
				service communications.  </p>
				<ol><ol type="1" start="4">

				    <li>Transfer of Assets: </li>
				</ol></ol>
				<p>            As we continue to develop our business, 
				we may sell or purchase assets.  If another entity acquires us 
				or all (or substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable 
				information and non-personal information we have about you will be transferred 
				to and used by this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable 
				steps to ensure that your preferences are followed.  Also, if any 
				bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, 
				all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such
