      <p><b><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></b><font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
      <p>UNIServe is an Internet Service Provider providing a full range of Internet 
        services primarily to British Columbia and other provinces in Canada. 
        For UNIServe, customer and employee privacy is a high priority. We have 
        a long-standing policy of protecting the privacy of customers in all of 
        our business operations. Federal Government Statute dictates that private 
        sector organizations must follow a standardized code for the protection 
        of personal information. Businesses, consumers, academics and government 
        under the auspices of the Canadian Standards Association developed the 
        code â€“ <i>the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents 
        Act </i>("the Act"). It lists 10 principles of fair information 
        practices, which form ground rules for the collection, use and disclosure 
        of personal information. These principles give individuals control over 
        how their personal information is handled in the private sector. UNIServe 
        is a strong believer in the objectives and goals of the Code and this 
        policy paper sets out how we will adhere to the principles set down in 
        the Code.</p>
      <p>We believe that an organization is responsible for the protection of 
        personal information and the fair handling of it at all times, throughout 
        the organization and in dealings with third parties. Care in collecting, 
        using and disclosing personal information is essential to continued employee 
        and consumer confidence and good will. </p>
      <p>The <b>10 principles</b> that businesses must follow are:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> 1. Accountability <br>
          2. Identifying purposes <br>
          3. Consent <br>
          4. Limiting collection <br>
          5. Limiting use, disclosure, and retention <br>
          6. Accuracy <br>
          7. Safeguards <br>
          8. Openness <br>
          9. Customer and employee access <br>
          10. Challenging compliance</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="4"> &nbsp;Scope and Application</font></b></p>
      <p>The ten principles, which form the basis of the UNIServe Privacy Code, 
        are interrelated and UNIServe adheres to the ten principles as a whole. 
        Each principle must be read in conjunction with the accompanying commentary. 
        As permitted by the Act, the commentary in the UNIServe Privacy Code has 
        been tailored to reflect personal information issues specific to UNIServe.</p>
      <p>The scope and application of the UNIServe Privacy Code are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> The Code applies to personal information about UNIServe's customers 
          and employees that is collected, used, or disclosed by UNIServe.</li>
        <li>The Code applies to the management of personal information in any 
          form whether oral, electronic or written.</li>
        <li>The Code does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure 
          of the following information by UNIServe:</li>

        </ol>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>The Code does not apply to information regarding UNIServeâ€™s corporate 
          customers. However, such information is protected by other UNIServe 
          policies and practices and through contractual arrangements.</li>
        <li>The application of the UNIServe Privacy Code is subject to the requirements 
          and provisions of Part 1 of the Act, the regulations enacted thereunder, 
          and any other applicable legislation or regulations, including any applicable
