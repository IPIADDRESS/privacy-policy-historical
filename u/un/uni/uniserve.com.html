        <div class="content_name">Introduction</div>
        <p>Uniserve is an Internet Service Provider providing a full range of  Internet services primarily to British Columbia and other provinces in  Canada. For Uniserve, customer and employee privacy is a high priority.  We have a long-standing policy of protecting the privacy of customers in  all of our business operations. Federal Government Statute dictates  that private sector organizations must follow a standardized code for  the protection of personal information. Businesses, consumers, academics  and government under the auspices of the Canadian Standards Association  developed the code â€“ the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("the  Act"). It lists 10 principles of fair information practices, which form  ground rules for the collection, use and disclosure of personal  information. These principles give individuals control over how their  personal information is handled in the private sector. Uniserve is a  strong believer in the objectives and goals of the Code and this policy  paper sets out how we will adhere to the principles set down in the  Code. </p>
        <p>We believe that an organization is responsible for the protection of  personal information and the fair handling of it at all times,  throughout the organization and in dealings with third parties. Care in  collecting, using and disclosing personal information is essential to  continued employee and consumer confidence and good will. </p><br>

This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the Uniserve Communications website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.<br>

        You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>
<p>The 10 principles that businesses must follow are: </p><br>

        <ol>
          <li> Accountability </li>
          <li> Identifying purposes </li>

        </ol>
        <div class="content_name">Scope and Application</div>
        <p>The ten principles, which form the basis of the Uniserve Privacy  Code, are interrelated and Uniserve adheres to the ten principles as a  whole. Each principle must be read in conjunction with the accompanying  commentary. As permitted by the Act, the commentary in the Uniserve  Privacy Code has been tailored to reflect personal information issues  specific to Uniserve.</p>
        <p>The scope and application of the Uniserve Privacy Code are as follows: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> The Code applies to personal information about Uniserveâ€™s customers  and employees that is collected, used, or disclosed by Uniserve. </li>
          <li> The Code applies to the management of personal information in any form whether oral, electronic or written. </li>
          <li> The Code does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information by Uniserve:
            <p>a. A customerâ€™s name, address, telephone number and e-mail address,  when listed in a directory or available through directory assistance; </p>
            <p>b. An employeeâ€™s name, title, business address (including e-mail address) or business telephone or fax number; or </p>
            <p>c. Other information about the customer or employee that is publicly  available and is specified by regulation pursuant to the Personal  Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. </p>
          </li>
          <li> The Code does not apply to information regarding Uniserveâ€™s  corporate customers. However, such information is protected by other  Uniserve policies and practices and through contractual arrangements. </li>
          <li> The application of the Uniserve Privacy Code is subject to the  requirements and provisions of Part 1 of the Act, the regulations  enacted thereunder, and any other applicable legislation or regulations,  including any applicable regulations of the Canadian Radio-television  and Telecommunications Commission. </li>
