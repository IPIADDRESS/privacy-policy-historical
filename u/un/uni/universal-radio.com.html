The exception being a specific radio supplier for product support. For example, we may share your information with Icom if you buy an Icom radio.

	</p><p>We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive.  Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties, except with specific suppliers for radio support.

		</p><p><a name="4"></a><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b>
		<br>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  We do not permanently store credit card information.  This information is periodically purged. CID numbers are not stored electronically.

		</p><p><a name="5"></a><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</b>
		<br>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.

There is no adult material on our website.
