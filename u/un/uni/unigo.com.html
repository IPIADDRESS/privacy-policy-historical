<p>By visiting the Web Sites, and/or by using the services available on the Web Sites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time.&nbsp; As we update and expand our services, this Privacy Policy may change, so check back to this page from time to time.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the&nbsp;<a title="Web Site Terms of Use" href="/Terms.aspx">Web Site Terms of Use</a>, which also governs your use of the Web Sites in general.</p>
<p>The Web Sites are intended for users who are located in the United States of America.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, through sources other than our Web Sites, such as by phone, through postal mail and through other live and print media, including without limitation, information obtained from or provided to us by third parties.</p>
<p><strong>You may opt in or opt out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes by following the directions in the “Right to Opt In and Opt Out” section below.</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
Your privacy is important to us.&nbsp; In order to make your visits to our Web Sites and use of the services available through our Web Sites as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information and we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit the Web Sites.&nbsp; “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” includes, for example, your name; home and/or business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless and/or fax number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; demographic information, educational and scholastic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Opt In and Opt Out</strong>&nbsp;<br>

<p>Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.&nbsp; Also, a request to have us stop sharing your Personal Information with other entities for marketing purposes will only apply as of the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your Personal Information prior to such request.&nbsp; In these cases, please contact that entity directly.</p>
<p><strong>What Information is Collected on the Web Sites?</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>User-Provided Information</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>Web Site Usage Information</strong></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp; Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies track where you travel on our Web Sites and what you look at and purchase.&nbsp; They may store your username and/or password.&nbsp; A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you, including your Personal Information.&nbsp; All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.&nbsp; Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.&nbsp; However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Sites or certain areas or features of the Web Sites.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Clear GIFs</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the Web Sites and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.&nbsp; A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>IP Address and Clickstream Data</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our servers automatically collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us.&nbsp; This information is known as an IP Address, and is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider.&nbsp; When you request pages from our Web Sites, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.&nbsp; Our servers may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Sites; the Web site you visit after our Web Sites; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Sites or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.&nbsp; We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Sites.&nbsp; Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; We may also link this information with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
<p><strong>How is Personal Information Used?</strong></p>
<p>We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web Sites, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our services and features.&nbsp; We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping.&nbsp; We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings and the like) and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.&nbsp; You may opt out of receiving such correspondence by following the instructions in the <strong>Right to Opt In and Opt Out</strong> section.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other entities, including, without limitation, institutions of higher education and promotional partners, who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you.&nbsp; Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the <strong>Right to Opt In and Opt Out</strong> section above, we may provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.&nbsp; If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your Personal Information with these types of third parties, follow the instructions to opt out in the <strong>Right to Opt In and Opt Out</strong> section above.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We may offer contests, sweepstakes and other offerings (including, for example, scholarship opportunities) on our Web Sites, some of which may be operated by or co-sponsored with another company.&nbsp; In those situations, unless you give your information to that other company directly, the information we may obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering may be shared with our sponsor and other third parties, unless you instruct us not to by following the instructions in the <strong>Right to Opt In and Opt Out</strong> section above.&nbsp; In those situations, such other companies or our co-sponsors may have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies.&nbsp; We are not responsible for how such other companies or our co-sponsors may use your information.

<blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Aggregate Statistics</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Sites and e-mails to third parties&nbsp;in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Legally Compelled Disclosures</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may disclose user information (which may include Personal Information) to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.&nbsp; We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Web Sites, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
