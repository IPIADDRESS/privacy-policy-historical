<h2 class="">What Information is Collected on the Web Sites?</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="title-privacy">User-Provided Information</h3>
<h4 class="subtitle">User Information</h4>
<p>We collect Personal Information from Users of our Web Sites, for example, through such Users' activities, transactions and completion of online forms on our Web Sites.  Such information may be collected, for example, when Users create profiles, register or subscribe for accounts or features on our Web Sites, enter into online transactions, complete surveys, provide college reviews, respond to polls, input information into our interactive programming features such as our interactive calendar and search engine, submit content, including without limitation, media files, photos, videos, documents or other information to the Web Sites, contribute to a chat room, list serve, blog or other open forum or community feature that we may make available on our Web Sites, submit a comment or question to us using a "contact us" or similar feature on our Web Sites, send us an e-mail, view web pages, advertisements or file attachments, or in any other way submit Personal Information to us via our Web Sites.   </p>
<p>You may be able to send information about our products and services to your friends and family members through our Web Sites by clicking on an E-mail to Friend or similar button on our Web Sites or in an e-mail that we have sent you.  In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you may be able to provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us.  If you have a Gmail account and have given us permission to access your Gmail address book to make suggestions about friends or family members you may want to send such messages to, you understand that Unigo may access your Gmail account address book for such purposes.  Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="subtitle">Registration Information</h4>
<p>If you register as a Member or a Counselor using Unigo, we collect and store Personal Information that specifically identifies you or your account.  At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is your first name, last name, User ID, password, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and valid financial Account information.  Other information requested in the registration form is optional, and may be used to help us to tailor our services to you in the Site and deliver personalized information to you.</p>
<p>Credit card or other financial Account information is transmitted via SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") encryption for your protection.</p>
<p>Without your agreement or consent, we will not share, rent or sell any Personal information with third parties in any way other than what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="subtitle">Unigo Account Transaction Payment</h4>
<p>Unigo requires you as a Member to pay with a credit card, debit card or PayPal.  Consequently, Unigo will collect your credit card number and/or other entered financial institution information such as bank account numbers or PayPal email ID and will use that information to process financial transactions incurred at the Web Site and/or to perform the billing operation on behalf of the Counselor, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.  Verification of credit card information, however, is accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="title-privacy">Web Site Usage Information</h3>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="subtitle">Cookies</h4>
<p>We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.  Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies track where you travel on our Web Sites and what you look at and purchase.  They may store your username and/or password.  A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you, including your Personal Information.  All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.  Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Sites or certain areas or features of the Web Sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="subtitle">Clear GIFs</h4>
<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Web Sites and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.  A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
IP Address and Clickstream Data
<p>Our servers automatically collect data about your server's Internet address when you visit us.  This information is known as an IP Address, and is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider.  When you request pages from our Web Sites, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.  Our servers may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Sites; the Web site you visit after our Web Sites; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Sites or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.  We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Sites.  Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.  We may also link this information with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="subtitle">How is Personal Information Used?</h4>
<p>We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web Sites, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our services and features.  We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping.  We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties.   </p>
<p>In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings and the like) and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you.  You may opt out of receiving such correspondence by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section.</p>
<p>We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="subtitle">Private Chat Room</h3>
<p>The Private Chat Room area of the Web Site is for the benefit of Member(s) who purchased service from Counselor.

The information contained in Private Chat Room shared between Member(s) and Counselor, including text, images, audio or video chats, is not used for any purposes other than to facilitate communication and the exchange of information between the parties involved.  Unigo reserves the right to monitor communications in the Private Chat Room in order to verify compliance with our Terms of Service, international, federal or state laws and/or our other stated policies.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="subtitle">User Profiles</h3>

Unless you elect not to receive such offers by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above, we may provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.  If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your Personal Information with these types of third parties, follow the instructions to opt out in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above.</p>
Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings
<p>We may offer contests, sweepstakes and other offerings (including, for example, scholarship opportunities) on our Web Sites, some of which may be operated by or co-sponsored with another company.  In those situations, unless you give your information to that other company directly, the information we may obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering may be shared with our sponsor and other third parties, unless you instruct us not to by following the instructions in the Right to Opt In and Opt Out section above.  In those situations, such other companies or our co-sponsors may have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies.

<p>We endeavor to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive Personal Information provided to us via our Web Sites.  We will use commercially reasonable methods to keep Personal Information securely in our files and systems.  Our Payment System is operated using secure Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, to help protect your financial data.  However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. </p>

We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision, nor will we have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.  If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, if we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.  You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
