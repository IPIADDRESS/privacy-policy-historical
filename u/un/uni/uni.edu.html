      Commitment to Privacy
      </h4>
      <p>The University of Northern Iowa (UNI) values individuals' privacy and
actively seeks to preserve privacy rights of those who share information with
us. Your trust is important to us and we believe you have the right to know how
information submitted through the UNI Web site is handled. </p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>  
      <p>The following information explains the Internet privacy practices the 
  university has adopted for its <a href="/help/siteDefs.html">official Web sites</a>. In legal terms, however, it shall not 
  be construed as a contractual promise and the university reserves the right to amend it at 
  any time without notice. Privacy and public records obligations of the university are 
  governed by applicable Iowa statutes, including, but not limited to Chapter 22 of the <a href="http://www.legis.state.ia.us/IowaLaw.html">Code 
  of Iowa</a>, and by any applicable U.S. federal laws. The University of Northern Iowa respects 
  the privacy of users visiting our Web sites and will abide by all applicable laws concerning 
  the release of personal information (e.g., <a href="http://access.uni.edu/help/caution.htm">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974)</a>.
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;      </p>
    
      <h4>The Information We Collect</h4>
      <p>The Web Privacy Statement speaks generally to the information collected by or submitted to 
official UNI Web sites (see the definition above). Since the amount and type of information collected 
varies from site to site, there may be more specific privacy notices pertaining to the collection and 
use of personal information associated exclusively with particular pages. Thus it is wise for you to 
read page-specific notices to ensure you understand the privacy policies and practices applicable to a 
particular site.
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;      </p>
      <p>When you access official UNI Web pages, certain client information and essential, as well as 
nonessential technical information (collectively referred to as access information) is automatically 
collected. To see a list of this information, view <a href="http://access.uni.edu/help/accessInfo.html">Access Information (Automatically Collected)</a>. 
No other information is collected through our official Web sites except when you deliberately send it 
to us (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an e-mail). To see examples of the information you 
might choose to send us, see <a href="http://access.uni.edu/help/optInfo.html">Optional Information (Deliberately Sent)</a>.
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;      </p>
      <h4>The Way We Use Information</h4>
      <p>As a general rule, UNI does not track individual visitor profiles. We do, however, analyze 
aggregate traffic and access information for resource management and site planning purposes. 
UNI reserves the right to use log details to investigate resource management or security concerns. 
To find out how we use access information, see <a href="http://access.uni.edu/help/accessInfo.html#Uses">Access Information Uses</a>. To find out how we use
optional information, see <a href="http://access.uni.edu/help/optInfo.html#Uses">Optional Information Uses</a>.
We will never sell or rent your e-mail address or other individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission. Information submitted to us is used to interact with you based on your request for information or continue communications based on a prior relationship.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;      </p>
<h4>Providing Information is Your Choice </h4>
<p>There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our Web site. Our Web 
site will not work, however, without routing information and essential technical information. 
Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of 
our Web site but may prevent certain features from working. For any optional information that is 
requested at our Web site, failure to provide the requested information will mean that the particular 
feature or service associated with that part of the Web page may not be available to you.
</p>
 <p>&nbsp;      </p><h4>Our Commitment To Data Security</h4>
<p>The University of Northern Iowa is dedicated to taking reasonable precautions in preventing 
unauthorized data access, maintaining data accuracy, and ensuring the appropriate use of information. 
We strive to put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to secure the 
information we collect online. These security practices are consistent with the policies of the 
university and with the laws and regulatory practices of the State of Iowa and the Federal government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p><h4>How To Contact Us</h4>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies and practices, 
please call University Marketing and Public Relations at (319) 273-2761 or send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:webteam@uni.edu">webteam@uni.edu</a>. 
If you wish to review or change information gathered about you via an official University of 
Northern Iowa Web site but you do not know how, University Marketing and Public Relations will assist in locating 
the persons responsible for that site so that you may make your request directly to them.
