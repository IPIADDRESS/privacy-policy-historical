If we share your information, it is with the goal of bringing you quality services, more choices, and greater convenience. Information we may have about former members is generally only shared or disclosed if necessary to enforce or administer an account or as required by law. </p>

<ul>
<li> Sharing Information with Third Party Service Providers<br>

These service 	providers act on our behalf and have agreed in writing to keep the 	member information we provide to them confidential. We share the 	following categories of information to third party service providers 	depending on the specific services provided:

<p> 	</p><ul>- Personal information (name, address and account number)<br>
 	- Account Information (type of accounts, account balances, and transaction history)<br>

<p></p></li><li>Sharing Information as Legally Required or Permitted<br>
We may share any member information of yours in response to a lawful 	request issued by a court, government agency, or regulatory authority or 	as permitted by law in order to administer or enforce your account.

</ul>
 
<p><strong>Privacy on the Internet:</strong><br>
Unitus Community Credit Union uses a cryptographic (digital certificate) key to secure account information sent between our server and your browser. Whenever you use uOnLine, Unitus' server responds to your transmission by sending this key that is authenticated by your browser. This communication key encrypts the data sent by you and Unitus Community Credit Union decrypts it when we receive it. Unitus uses firewalls that are designed to protect your accounts from unauthorized access from outside the Credit Union. </p>

<p><strong>Protecting Your Children's Information Privacy:</strong><br>
The online financial services offered through Unitus Community Credit Union's website are not designed for or directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children online without express parental consent or notification. If we receive online information from any child we will only use the information to respond directly to a child's request. We recognize that protecting children's identities and online privacy is important and that responsibility rests with us and with parents. If you believe your child has provided personally identifiable information to us, please contact us so we can allow you the opportunity to review and delete such information. </p>

<p><strong>What Members Can Do To Help:</strong><br>
Protect your account numbers, card numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers), and passwords. In particular, never keep your PIN with your debit card or credit card, as that makes you vulnerable in the event you lose your card or your card is stolen. Use caution in revealing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc., to other persons. In particular, if a caller tells you he/she is calling you on behalf of the Credit Union and asks for your account number, you should beware. Legitimate Credit Union staff would already have access to that information. It is important that the Credit Union has current information about how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent use of your account, we will attempt to contact you immediately. If your address or phone number changes, please let us know.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Policy Inquiries:</strong><br>
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at anytime and will notify you as required by law. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>
