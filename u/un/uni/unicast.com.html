      <h1>UNICAST'S PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
      <h1><img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"></h1>
      <h1>Unicast creates innovative online advertising formats that enable advertisers 
        and their agencies to design the most compelling online advertising while 
        protecting a Web site's performance and the end-user's experience. </h1>
      <p> As such, Unicast supports an individual's right to privacy on the Web 
        by providing the following information about Unicast's advertising unit, 
        The SUPERSTITIAL®. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>Privacy and SUPERSTITIALs:</b> 
      </p><p><img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>What is a SUPERSTITIAL?</b> 
      </p><p> The SUPERSTITIAL format from Unicast offers Web publishers, networks, 
        agencies and advertisers a viable vehicle for online advertising. Introduced 
        by Unicast to the US marketplace in May 1999, the SUPERSTITIAL has established 
        a new Internet advertising category - one with the potential to become 
        a standard that supports the long-term evolution of the Web as a global 
        mass medium. The SUPERSTITIAL format is proprietary to Unicast. 
      </p><p> SUPERSTITIALs are highly interactive, non-banner Internet commercials 
        that can feature full animation, sound and graphics without slowing down 
        the delivery of Web site content or the user's Web browsing experience 
        - regardless of a user's connection speed. 
      </p><p> SUPERSTITIAL ads can be up to 100K in file size and are created using 
        the preferred authoring tools of the Internet industry - including Macromedia 
        Flashœ. 
      </p><p> The Unicast patent-pending cache-and-play delivery system behind the 
        SUPERSTITIAL format minimizes the latency problems often experienced with 
        streaming online advertising solutions. Ads are fully pre-loaded before 
        playing and play only during a logical, user-initiated break in surfing, 
        triggered by a mouse click. 
      </p><p> This process standardizes the SUPERSTITIAL ad experience, ensuring that 
        every user gets a consistent and complete ad message. This unique delivery 
        system is what differentiates pre-loaded SUPERSTITIAL ads from streaming 
        interstitial and banner ads. 
      </p><p> According to Millward Brown Interactive, the leading interactive advertising 
        research firm, SUPERSTITIAL ads more effectively convey integrated, compelling 
        advertising messages and deliver higher ROI than any other online advertising 
        format available. 
      </p><p> SUPERSTITIALs can be used to achieve multiple advertising goals, including 
        branding, direct marketing, commerce and entertainment. Additionally, 
        because SUPERSTITIAL ad units are outside of the banner space, they create 
        an entirely new advertising tier for Web publishers and advertisers. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>How does The SUPERSTITIAL format's proprietary delivery system work?</b> 
      </p><p> SUPERSTITIAL ads do not interfere with Web site content loading. Instead, 
        SUPERSTITIAL ads are loaded and assembled in the user's browser cache 
        while the user is viewing or reading Web page content. The SUPERSTITIAL 
        plays only after the ad file is fully assembled. 
      </p><p> To facilitate the assembly of SUPERSTITIAL ads in the browser cache, 
        Unicast utilizes a JAVA¬ applet (an applet is a compilation of code that 
        coordinates the transmission of content or data): 
      </p><p> 1. The ad-loading process waits to begin until the user becomes "idle" 
        (i.e., not using their modem/connection to gather content from the host 
        Web site). 
      </p><p> 2. Unicast's JAVA applet is loaded into the browser cache. 
      </p><p> 3. In coordination with the Web site or the appropriate ad management 
        system, The SUPERSTITIAL ad is loaded and pre-assembled in the browser 
        cache. 
      </p><p> 4. During the loading process, if a user initiates the modem (by requesting 
        new content from the Web site), the loading process pauses. The loading 
        process then picks up where it left off after the user becomes idle again. 
      </p><p> 5. Once the SUPERSTITIAL ad is fully loaded and assembled in the browser 
        cache, when the user clicks to a new page, the SUPERSTITIAL ad will play 
        in its own window while the new content finishes loading. 
      </p><p> 6. Because the ad is playing from the browser cache (i.e., "locally"), 
        it will begin playing almost instantaneously upon launching. 
      </p><p> 7. SUPERSTITIAL ads can be closed at any time if the user clicks on 
        the corner "X" box of the browser window in which the ad is playing. 
      </p><p> 8. If the user lets the SUPERSTITAL play to completion without interacting 
        with the ad by clicking on it, the ad will self-close. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>Does the SUPERSTITIAL loading process interfere with my surfing experience 
        or slow my connection speed?</b> 
      </p><p> This loading process is invisible to the user and does not affect the 
        user's Web surfing experience. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>Once loaded, does the SUPERSTITIAL ad file or Unicast's JAVA applet 
        negatively affect my computer or my connection at all?</b> 
      </p><p> While in a user's cache, Unicast's JAVA applet does not impact the user's 
        computer, processor speed or connectivity. Likewise, while a SUPERSTITIAL 
        ad file is in a user's browser cache (either partially or fully loaded), 
        the user's Web experience is not affected. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>Is Unicast's JAVA applet a permanent download into my computer?</b> 
      </p><p> Unicast's JAVA applet and all SUPERSTITIAL ad files are pre-loaded into 
        the browser cache: the temporary storage area for the Web content a viewer 
        sees while surfing the Internet. (The temporary storage of content in 
        the cache allows users to easily access recently visited Web site content. 
        For example, when users press the "Back" button within the browser window, 
        they are triggering content from the browser cache.) 
      </p><p> Once in the browser cache, Unicast's JAVA applet remains there until 
        it is automatically deleted through the course of time or until a user 
        manually flushes the cache. ("Flushing" is a term for the elimination 
        of content from the browser cache.) 
      </p><p> Automatic deletion of cached content occurs when the browser cache becomes 
        completely filled with cached content such as Web site content files and 
        images. The older content is deleted from the cache to allow new content 
        to be stored. 
      </p><p> For many browsers, users can set their browser preferences to automatically 
        flush the browser cache according to a time schedule of their choosing. 
        Otherwise, a user can manually flush the browser cache at any time. Flushing 
        the cache eliminates Unicast's JAVA applet and any fully or partially 
        loaded SUPERSTITIAL ad files from the user's cache until the next time 
        a SUPERSTITIAL ad is served to the user. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>How can I tell when Unicast's JAVA applet or SUPERSTITIAL ad files 
        have been loaded into my cache?</b> 
      </p><p> If a user sees a SUPERSTITIAL ad, Unicast's JAVA applet and the SUPERSTITIAL 
        ad file have been loaded into the browser cache. To eliminate Unicast's 
        JAVA applet and any fully or partially loaded SUPERSTITIAL ad files from 
        the cache, a user can manually flush the browser cache. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>What happens to a SUPERSTITIAL ad file after it plays?</b> 
      </p><p> Upon completion of the ad's play, the SUPERSTITIAL ad file remains in 
        the browser cache according to the user's browser specifications. Again, 
        to remove Unicast's JAVA applet and any SUPERSTITIAL ad files, the user 
        can manually flush the browser cache at any time. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>What happens to a partially loaded SUPERSTITIAL ad file if a user 
        leaves a Web site before the ad has played?</b> 
      </p><p> If a user leaves a site before a SUPERSTITIAL ad has been able to fully 
        assemble, the partially loaded ad remains in the browser cache. Should 
        the user return to a Web site that is part of the media buy for that particular 
        SUPERSTITIAL ad campaign, the SUPERSTITIAL ad will continue loading into 
        the browser cache from the point at which it had left off when the user 
        becomes idle on the new site. 
      </p><p> If the user never returns to a site that is part of the media buy for 
        that particular SUPERSTITIAL ad, the partially loaded ad file will remain 
        in the browser cache until it is automatically deleted according to the 
        user's browser specifications or until the user manually flushes the browser 
        cache. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>What kind of information is collected about users who see a SUPERSTITIAL 
        ad?</b> 
      </p><p> Unicast logs click stream and impression data (i.e., how many SUPERSTITIAL 
        ads played and how many users click on an ad) for every SUPERSTITIAL ad 
        campaign and may collect anonymous domain, browser and system configuration 
        information from computers that have been served a SUPERSTITIAL advertisement. 
        This information is not personally identifiable and does not include name, 
        address, phone or email address. Anonymous domain information is collected, 
        stored securely on Unicast's server and analyzed by Unicast. 
      </p><p> On behalf of the advertisers and Web sites for which it serves SUPERSTITIAL 
        ad campaigns, Unicast also may aggregate additional information about 
        users' interactions within SUPERSTITIAL ads. This tracking includes multiple 
        clicks to different products or services featured in an ad, and depth 
        and length of interaction within the ad. 
      </p><p> The scope of information gathered by Unicast regarding user interaction 
        within SUPERSTITIAL ads varies from campaign to campaign and is directed 
        by the goals of the specific advertiser. All tracking information Unicast 
        monitors is completely anonymous and is reported in aggregate. 
      </p><p> If the user enters information, including personally identifiable information, 
        in a form or comment area of an ad, this information is collected by Unicast 
        for the advertiser, as well. Other than what the user voluntarily provides, 
        all information is anonymous and personally unidentifiable. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>What does Unicast do with the anonymous information it collects around 
        SUPERSTITIAL ad campaigns?</b> 
      </p><p> The anonymous tracking information Unicast monitors surrounding each 
        SUPERSTITIAL campaign is reported in aggregate to the advertiser and participating 
        Web sites by Unicast or the participating third party ad-serving network. 
      </p><p> Unicast retains aggregate domain, browser and system configuration information 
        on the computers that have been served a SUPERSTITIAL advertisement. Unicast 
        also retains click stream and impression data for each SUPERSTITIAL campaign. 
        Unicast does this in order to continually analyze the market penetration 
        and effectiveness of the SUPERSTITIAL format and to substantiate licensing 
        fees charged to Unicast's customers. 
      </p><p> Occasionally, Unicast may share the anonymous tracking information it 
        collects with third parties who perform technical audits of the accuracy 
        of such data for the benefit of Unicast as well as its advertisers, participating 
        Web sites and participating third party ad-serving networks. 
      </p><p> All such auditors enter into contracts with Unicast which contain confidentiality 
        clauses and the audit results are reported to Unicast and shared only 
        with Web sites and networks under contracts with Unicast containing confidentiality 
        clauses. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>Does Unicast ever collect any personally identifiable information 
        about users who see a SUPERSTITIAL ad?</b> 
      </p><p> In some cases, users may voluntarily provide personal information in 
        response to a specific ad where the advertiser requests such information 
        so that the advertiser may contact interested parties, provide requested 
        product literature and receive user feedback for processing. 
      </p><p> For example, a user may enter their name, email address and/or mailing 
        address when requesting more information from the advertiser. 
      </p><p> In these cases, the voluntarily provided user information is reported 
        to the advertiser by Unicast. Thereafter the privacy policy of the advertiser 
        applies to this information. Users are advised not to provide personal 
        information if they do not want it used by the advertiser. 
      </p><p> Common Market users authorize the export of this personal information 
        to the United States when they provide such information. 
      </p><p> Unicast does not keep, record or share this personally identifiable 
        information with any other outside parties, nor does Unicast keep or utilize 
        this information for internal purposes in any way. 
      </p><p> Unicast may, at the request of the advertiser, temporarily store the 
        personal information on its servers for a brief period (now up to 30 days) 
        as an added service to the advertiser, but in all cases Unicast is acting 
        as a conduit to the advertiser. At the end of the storage period, Unicast 
        delivers the personal information to the advertiser or its agent and deletes 
        it completely from the Unicast server. 
      </p><p> From time to time, Unicast may have special promotions or user surveys 
        or other events which are not part of its regular business activities 
        and which involve the collection of personally identifiable information. 
        Separate privacy notices will be included within event materials if these 
        differ from this notice. 
      </p><p> Any personally identifiable information collected through a SUPERSTITIAL 
        ad is not matched to any behavioral or anonymous information collected 
        by Unicast. 
      </p><p> <img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"> 
      </p><p><b>Does Unicast target or manage the viewing of SUPERSTITIAL advertising 
        to users?</b> 
      </p><p>Unicast is dedicated to providing sites and their users a positive Web 
        surfing experience. In addition to being polite, SUPERSTITIAL technology 
        has the capacity to manage the frequency with which users are exposed 
        to a SUPERSTITIAL ad. This helps insure that users are not bombarded with 
        repeat and messages. 
      </p><p> The means used by Unicast to manage the frequency of SUPERSTITIAL ads 
        a user is exposed to during a day or over an extended time period is in 
        the form of a <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/c/cookie.html">cookie</a>- 
        a small file placed in a web browser that stores information. 
      </p><p><img src="../img/blue_line_horizontal.gif" width="540" height="18"><br>
        <b>Does unicast compile user profiles in order to monitor the frequency 
        of SUPERSTITIAL ads?</b> 
      </p><p>No. Unicast controls the delivery system that brings SUPERSTITIAL advertisements 
        to users and the number of times a user may see a specific SUPERSTITIAL 
        advertisement by employing an <i>anonymous</i> cookie. The Unicast frequency-management 
        cookie collects no personally identifiable information and contains no 
        user ID.

      </p><p><b>What if I want to opt-out of the Unicast frequency-management cookie?</b>
      </p><p>Unicast has provided a page where users may opt-out of the frequency-management 
        cookie used to manage SUPERSTITIAL ad frequency. However, <i>once a user 
        has opted out of the frequency-management cookie, Unicast can no longer 
        recognize that user's browser from one visit to the next, hence the user

        that see their SUPERSTITIAL advertisements?</b>
      </p><p>Advertising content delivered via the Unicast SUPERSTITIAL system may 
        contain third-party cookies. Advertisers, and third party companies acting 
        on behalf of advertisers (such as an ad serving company or an ad agency), 
        use third-party cookies to judge the effectiveness of and target their 
        SUPERSTITIAL ad campaigns.
      </p><p>While Unicast's SUPERSTITIAL format delivers the ad content which may 
        allow a third-party cookie to be set, such cookies are not within Unicast's 
        control and the information they collect is reported back to the third 
        party directly, not through Unicast. Third-party cookies are placed and 
        tracked by the advertiser or by a third-party company. Unicast does not 
        have the access to the information tracked by third-party cookies.
      </p><p>Most third-party cookies anonymously track the Web browsing habits of 
        users and their interactions with the ads they view. However, users should 
        be aware that some cookies can collect other types of information, including 
        personally identifiable information.
      </p><p>While Unicast itself does not have access to the information tracked 
        by third-party cookies set through SUPERSTITIAL advertisements, there 
        are cases when the third party may agree to share such information with 
        Unicast. Such information sharing is done on an aggregate and anonymous 
        basis, and does not include any personally indentifiable information collected 
        by the third party.
      </p><p>The issue of third party cookies is a matter between the users and the 
        advertisers and/or the third party company representing the advertiser, 
        not involving Unicast. This information is provided by Unicast as a service 
        to users who may be unaware of third party cookies.

        third party cookies within SUPERSTITIAL advertisements, please visit the

      </p><p><b>Are Unicast's servers and the information stored on them secure? Is 
        the information accessible by users?</b> 
      </p><p> Unicast has taken industry-standard steps to secure information on its 
        servers. Only Unicast personnel are authorized to access the company's 
        servers. Because all stored information is anonymous, users are unable 
        to access their own clickstream information. 
      </p><p> Access by individual users to their temporarily stored personal information 
        awaiting delivery to an advertiser also is not possible, given the limitations 
        of currently available technology and Unicast's concerns about the privacy 
        of other users' personal information that is also being stored on its 
        servers.
