<b> </b></p></li><li><b> Collection of Personal Data</b>

	Email alert sign up 
	Donation form
	Comments Form
	Guestbook
	Online Surveys
	E-mail messages sent directly to our attention
<p>
	The United States Fund for UNICEF does collect aggregate non-personal data on the use of our website.  Examples of this type of data include statistics on what pages users access or visit, and the referring page from which users find us.  The information we collect is intended to help identify best practices for the design and strategy of our website.
</p><p>
<b> </b></p></li><li><b> "Cookies" </b>
<p>
	The United States Fund for UNICEF uses electronic marking devices ("cookies") only to track non-personal information while a user is visiting our site.  For a typical user visiting our web site, a random unique number is assigned that has no meaning outside our site.  This number is reset when the user leaves our site.  No personal information or linkage between this number and a particular user is ever made or saved in any form.

</p><p>
<b> </b></p></li><li><b> Children </b>
<p>
	We are especially concerned about ensuring the privacy of children online.  
Please note that we try to ensure that all our activities (particularly the "Trick or Treat for UNICEF" program) are coordinated by an adult and therefore make every effort to send information to adults only. If you are aware that a child has provided their name to us, please let us know by entering their name in the CHILD ALERT box and by providing us with a supervising adult's contact information using the change of address form located at <a href="../trickortreat/privacy/index.html">http://www.unicefusa.org/trickortreat/privacy/index.html</a>
</p><p>
<b> </b></p></li><li><b> Dissemination of Personal Data</b>
	The United States Fund for UNICEF does not rent, exchange, or sell the electronic mail addresses of our supporters.
<p>
<b> </b></p></li><li><b> Donor Bill of Rights</b>
	The United States Fund for UNICEF believes in the rights of donors and subscribes to the <i>Donor Bill of Rights</i>.  This statement of rights was developed by American Association of Fund Raising Counsel (AAFRC), Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the National Society of Fund Raising Executives (NSFRE).  The full text of the <i>Donor Bill of Rights</i> follows:
<p>
Philanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To assure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the not-for-profit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:
</p><p><i>
    I.  To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.<br>
    II.  To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization's governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgement in its stewardship responsibilities. <br>
   III.  To have access to the organization's most recent financial statements. <br>
   IV.  To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given. <br>
    V.  To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition. <br>
   VI.  To be assured that information about their donations is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law. <br>
  VII.  To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature. <br>
  VIII.  To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors. <br>
   IX.  To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share. <br>
    X.  To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers. </i>
</p><p>
<b> </b></p></li><li><b> Security of Data Transmittal</b>
<p>
	Donations made on the www.unicefusa.org website are secure to the fullest extent possible.  We use strong 128 bit encryption through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  SSL protects information as it is transferred through the Internet.
</p><p>
	You can recognize secure Web site pages by checking for the secure symbol at the bottom of your browser screen.  For most browsers, this symbol is either a lock or a key.  When the lock symbol appears to be locked, the page is secure.  When it appears to be unlocked, the page is insecure.
