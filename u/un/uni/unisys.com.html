This notice also provides other useful information regarding the data we collect and how we use cookies.</p>

	<h3>Types of Personal Data We Collect</h3>

	<p>We may ask you to voluntarily provide personal data (e.g., name, physical and e-mail addresses, company name, telephone number, etc.) in order to request our services or use certain features of our websites.

	<p>We are a global enterprise based in the United States with operations in countries around the world. Authorized Unisys personnel and third parties acting on our behalf may access, use and process personal data collected from you in a country that is different from the country where you entered the personal data. By providing your personal data, you consent to the sharing of your personal data as described above and any resulting cross-border transfers.</p>

	<p>When you visit a Unisys website we or our third party service provider may collect information through the use of a "cookie," a small file sent to your browser by Unisys or its service providers, as you navigate our website. The cookies we and our service providers use are unique to you and can only be read by our or our third-party service providers' web servers. The cookies perform different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and improving your overall experience. You do not have to accept any cookies. If you choose not to accept a cookie, however, it may affect your ability to access certain content or functionality offered by our website.</p>

	<p>Performance Cookies - These cookies collect information about your and other visitor's browsing behavior such as IP address, type of browser used, domain name and pages visited. This information is anonymously aggregated from many users to learn about the usage and effectiveness of our web properties in order to improve how our website works. These cookies are session and persistent cookies.</p>

	<p>For example, we use a tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site.

	<p>Functionality Cookies - These cookies remember your preferences (e.g., user name, language, time zone, region, areas of interest, etc.) and provide you with a more personalized web experience. These are usually persistent cookies. For example, we use a persistent cookie on My Unisys to deliver the personalized content you requested. Deleting the persistent cookie might mean that you need to logon the next time you visit our site to see the content associated with the interests you defined during your My Unisys registration. By setting preferences on our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.</p>

	<p>You can find more information about cookies generally at:  <u><b> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a></b></u> and you can learn more about browser cookies and how to manage them by visiting the website of your browser provider (e.g., Google; Microsoft; Apple; Mozilla). Most browsers are set to accept cookies. Using your browser help feature, you can manage your browser cookie preferences to, for example, automatically accept cookies, automatically decline cookies, or notify you before receiving a cookie. You can also manage your acceptance of the Google Analytics cookie by visiting the Google Analytics website. If you use our websites and choose not to disable cookies, you agree that we or our service provider can place them on your device.</p>

	<p>We may also use web beacons in marketing email to identify whether email sent was received, opened, or embedded links clicked. Web beacons may also work with cookies to better understand how users navigate our websites and what content is reviewed.</p>
