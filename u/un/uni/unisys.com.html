		<h2>Unisys Global Privacy Policy on Personal Data</h2>
		<div class="inner">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      
      <p>In the course of conducting our information services and technology business worldwide, Unisys collects and processes personally identifiable information of our clients, shareholders, employees, suppliers, business partners, website visitors and other persons (Personal Data).   Maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of Personal Data and handling it correctly is central to the way we conduct our business activities. This policy describes how we handle Personal Data.</p>
      
      <p>Personal Data is information that can be used directly or indirectly to identify a living individual.  Personal Data may include sensitive categories of information, such as information that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, health or sexual orientation (Sensitive Personal Data).</p>
      
      <p>This policy applies to Unisys Corporation and its subsidiaries, and is effective as of October 1, 2002. All employees will be required to abide by this policy.</p>
      
      <p>This policy is designed to protect Personal Data under applicable law as it currently exists. However, Unisys realizes that this policy cannot address every potential issue and circumstance. Therefore, we acknowledge that this policy is subject in all respects to applicable local legal and regulatory requirements and existing agreements and confirm that we will comply with such requirements and existing agreements.</p>

      <p>We will not process Personal Data in a manner incompatible with the purposes for which it was originally collected unless later authorized by the affected individuals or allowed by law; we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such data is accurate, adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to such purposes; and we will not keep such data longer than is necessary for such purposes.</p>
      
      <p>We will enable individuals to choose whether their Personal Data can be disclosed to a third party for direct marketing purposes.</p>
      
      <h4>Access</h4>

      <h4>Security/Integrity</h4>
      
      <p>We will take reasonable security procedures through appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful access or processing, disclosure, alteration, destruction or accidental loss of Personal Data.</p>
      
      <p>We will utilize reasonable means to keep Personal Data accurate, complete and current in order to protect the quality and integrity of Personal Data, however, we rely on individuals to provide all relevant information and to advise us of any changes to their Personal Data to ensure that it remains accurate, complete and current.</p>
