  <h1 class="mb5">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="cl mb20">Last updated: 16 May 2013</p>
  <p>Unity Technologies ApS (“Unity”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we receive from users of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://unity3d.com/">http://unity3d.com/</a> (“the Site”)</li>
<li>the Unity Editor game development software; the Unity Player runtime software included or downloaded with any content created with the Unity Editor; the Unity Union game distribution and publication service; and the Unity Asset Store (collectively the “Services”), including users who access and use the Services through a mobile device.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us or that we collect through the Services and to certain non-identifiable usage data collected via Google Analytics when you play games developed with the Unity Editor or games published or distributed by Unity.</p>

<p class="mb40">This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Unity Terms of Use</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p class="mb20">Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide, administer and improve our Services and software, and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate and interact with the Services and Unity software.</p>

<h3>Personal Information.</h3>

<p>We will collect personal information when you:</p>

<ul>
<li>register with us through the Services and create a Unity Account,</li>
<li>submit your resume to apply for a position with Unity,</li>
<li>make a purchase via the Services,</li>
<li>submit and/or sell assets, content or games via the Services,</li>
<li>submit a request for technical support,</li>
<li>submit a request for information about the Services,</li>
<li>download, register, and/or install any Unity software, or</li>
<li>post any content via the Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, company, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses.</p>

<p class="mb20">We use your Personal Information mainly to provide and improve the Services, complete your transactions, enforce licensing terms, and administer your inquiries. We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with Unity newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, you may follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or opt-out of receiving such communications via the Services (See <strong>“Changing or Deleting Information”</strong>, below).</p>

<h3>Non-Personal Information.</h3>

<ul>
<li>We also collect other information that does not identify you that you provide as part of registration and through your use of the Services (“Non-Personal Information”).</li>
<li>When you download and install the Unity game development software, we will collect certain Non-Personal Information, including your IP address, operating system, username, host name, and hardware ID, during your first use of the software. When you use the Unity game development software, the software may automatically make Internet connections to check for updates, validate your license keys, and provide us with anonymous usage statistics.</li>
<li>In order to use certain aspects of Unity’s free services and software, you may also be required to complete a survey asking you to provide additional information about yourself and your interests that can be used by Unity to better tailor its services and offers to you.</li>
<li>When you install or play games or content developed with the Unity Editor (which will either contain or require the download and installation of the Unity Player), we may collect some or all of the following Non- Personal Information about your system or device during your first use of the software:

<ul>
<li>Device manufacturer and model</li>
<li>The operating system and version running on your system or device;</li>
<li>Browser type;</li>
<li>IP address;</li>
<li>Unique device identifier generated from the device MAC/IMEI/MEID;</li>
<li>Language;</li>
<li>The make of the CPU, and number of CPUs present;</li>
<li>The graphics card type and vendor name;</li>
<li>Graphics card driver name and version (example: "nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71");</li>
<li>Which graphics API is in use (example: "OpenGL 2.1" or "Direct3D 9.0c");</li>
<li>Amount of system and video RAM present;</li>
<li>Current screen resolution;</li>
<li>Version of the Unity Player;</li>
<li>Version of the Unity Editor used to create the content;</li>
<li>A number describing whether the player is running on Mac, Windows or other platforms; and</li>
<li>A checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it did transmit correctly.</li>
<li>Application or bundle identification ("app id") of the game installed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you download, install, and play games published or distributed by Unity, we may collect Non-Personal Information, including your IP address and, as well as anonymous usage statistics about your interactions with the game.</li>
<li>We may combine Personal and Non-Personal Information that we collect from you with information we obtain about you from third parties (e.g., updated contact information and additional demographic information). We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Unity Users (defined below) to customize your user experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services, to inform you about Unity products and services that may be of interest to you, and to analyze and understand how our Services are used.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb20"><em>Log Data.</em> When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information about your interactions with the Services (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Services, pages of our Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Services, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service, to administer the Services, to improve the Services, and to better tailor the Services to our users’ needs. We may also use your IP address and your language settings to discern your general location, and use that information to customize the Services for that location.</p>

<h3>Cookie Policy</h3>

<p class="cookies">Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Unity Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and Site and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Services.</p>

<p>We may also allow certain third parties who perform analytic and marketing functions for us to place cookies on your browser to collect non-personal information about your use of the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers or ad networks. If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored advertising, please visit the following links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into a mobile application published by Unity or developed with the Unity Editor, you may still receive in application advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements that relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device. http://oo.apple.com. If you are using an iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of tailored advertisements by: Open Settings and tap “General” then tap “About”; Scroll to the bottom of About and tap “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad Tracking” to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application advertisements, you can visit Google’s Ads Preferences page from a browser on your device and make your choices there.</p>

<p class="mb40"><em>Other Technologies.</em> We may use standard Internet technology, such as Web beacons (also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Services. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to improve our existing Services, create new Services, and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, marketing campaigns, and the Services.</p>

<h2>Phishing</h2>

<p class="mb40">Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Unity. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Account information, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<p>Asset Store Submissions. If you choose to submit any asset to the Asset Store, other users of the Services will see your seller name and the information you have made available on your Publisher profile.</p>

<p>Unity Community. If you choose to post a question, comment, or other content in the Unity Feedback, Unity Answers, or Unity Forums areas of the Services, other users of the Services will be able to see the content you have posted. They will also be able to see the username you used to register with the particular area of the Services and any other information you may choose to make public. If you choose to sign in to your Unity Feedback account using your Facebook, Google, or other social networking site (“SNS”) login, we will collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any information available to us via the SNS interface.</p>

<p>Non-Personal Information. We may aggregate and/or anonymize information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other Non-Personal Information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.</p>

<p>Service Providers. We may use third parties to provide certain functions of the Services on our behalf (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, payment processing, web analytics, and improvement of the Services), to communicate with you on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (e.g., surveys). These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Unity cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Unity or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p class="mb40">Business Transfers. Unity may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>

<p class="mb40">All Unity Account holders may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided during registration by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@unity3d.com">privacy@unity3d.com</a>. If you completely delete all such information, then your Account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your Account in our system, please contact us at <a href="mailto:accounts@unity3d.com">accounts@unity3d.com</a> with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p class="mb40">Unity is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ commercially reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>International Transfer</h2>

<p class="mb40">We operate the Services in Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea and, depending on your country of residence, the submission of Personal Information via the Services may involve some transfer of personal information to Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, or South Korea. You should be aware that privacy laws in Denmark, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, or South Korea may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence. We have taken steps to ensure that appropriate levels of protection necessary to maintain the security and quality of your Personal Information are in place and that any transferred data is processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites and Services</h2>

<p class="mb40">We have relationships with third-party providers to handle certain functions of the Services. In certain cases, these providers may collect information from you directly and the collection and use of such information will be subject to the provider’s Privacy Policy, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. In those cases, the provider’s logo and a link to the provider’s website will be visible. Our Services also contain links to other websites, online services or applications (each a “Third Party Service”). If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website or online service. The fact that we link to a Third Party Service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over Third Party Services. Such Third Party Services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and online services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other Third Party Services you visit.</p>

<h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2>

<p class="mb40">The Services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:accounts@unity3d.com">accounts@unity3d.com</a> and we will remove the information.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@unity3d.com">privacy@unity3d.com</a>.</p></div></div><div class="g4n sidebar"><div class="ruler-t"></div>
