<p>In addition, we may also share among our family of companies "non-experience information" about you.&nbsp; Non-experience information is information that is not related to our transactions or other experience with you.&nbsp; We may receive non-experience information about you from applications and other forms or from outside sources such as credit reporting agencies.</p>

					<font class="bodytext"><p class="BodyCopy">At Union Bank of California, our team of technical security specialists work toward ensuring that all financial transactions, data transmissions and communications are completed in a secure online environment. To safeguard all financial and personal information, Union Bank:</p>

<div class="BodyCopy">
<ul>
<li>Requires both a user ID and a password, and ensures that only the user knows his or her password<br>
Uses encrypted pages for password log-ins</li>

<li>Retains all account data in secure Bank systems</li>

<li>Protects all e-mail sent to the Bank and ensures that email received by the Bank is seen only by a Union Bank employee</li>

<li>Maintains high standards for employee training, instilling in each Bank professional a respect for client confidentiality</li>

<li>Our systems of record protect all financial and personal information, and are anchored by state-of-the-art security features</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><span class="Subhead">Browser Requirements</span><br>
To support our secure 128-bit encryption, Union Bank operates only with 4.0 or higher versions of both Netscape and Microsoft web browser software. These browsers also prevent any encrypted information from being written onto the user's hard drive, which makes it impossible for an unauthorized user to access Union Bank customer account data. The links below will enable you to download either Netscape or Microsoft's 128-bit browser:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/default.jsp" extlinkid="1304896">Netscape Communicator High Security Browser Download</a>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a href="http://microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/recommended/128bit/default.asp" extlinkid="1304912">Microsoft Explorer High Security Browser Download</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Netscape and Microsoft use the following terms to identify the 128-bit browser: "strong", "domestic grade", "high-security".</p>

<p><span class="Subhead">Cookies</span><br>
Union Bank does not store encrypted personal information in the form of cookies. We use cookies only to access stored passwords or to enable users to customize information. We also use cookies to scan connecting PCs for information, which helps us determine if an online session is genuine.</p>

<p>At Union Bank, we are committed to maintaining the highest possible levels of data security. This dedication drives our efforts to apply the latest technology to constantly improve security; and to conduct frequent tests and updates of our systems and practices. If you have questions about our Security Policy, please contact us.</p>

<p><span class="Subhead">Cryptography</span><br>
We utilize public-key cryptography (rather than same-key cryptography) to encrypt account information sent to and from Union Bank over the Web.</p>

<p><span class="Subhead">Encryption</span><br>
We use 128-bit encryption, which is the most powerful encryption protection available for Web transactions. Strictly guarded and very difficult to export, 128-bit encryption ensures that information exchanged online can only be read by our special decoding software.</p>

<p><span class="Subhead">Firewalls</span><br>
Firewalls have been placed between users and bank servers, as well as between Bank servers and Bank systems where account data is housed. We are ICSA certified, (for details on certification criteria, see <a href="http://www.icsa.net/">www.icsa.net</a> and we employ an expert, third-party service to scan our Network regularly for potential vulnerabilities.</p></font></td>

				<tr><td colspan="2" class="bodytop7padding">
					<font class="bodytext"><p>Identity theft is when someone pretends that they are you when committing a crime. Crimes involving identity theft or impersonation are on the rise and are now the types of crimes that are most frequently reported to the Federal Trade Commission. The crime could be in person, over the telephone or Internet, or through the mail. This increasing trend is mainly attributable to technology. As technology continues to evolve, criminals are developing new ways to exploit or defraud organizations and consumers alike, including attempts to access bank accounts, brokerage accounts, and/or steal credit information or identities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Both state and federal governments continue to enact legislation to help protect consumers and Union Bank of California is diligent in its efforts to protect customers' information. In our continuing effort to safeguard your privacy, we've implemented a number of enhanced security and identification measures. These efforts include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<div>Requiring more identification for over-the-counter cash transactions</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Discontinuation of check verifications</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Installation of ultraviolet verification equipment in our offices to detect counterfeit id's, checks and currency</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Posting strategic warnings on our online banking and web sites to alert and inform our customers of recent incident's involving e-mail and online fraud schemes</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="Subhead">How you can help prevent identity theft:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<div>Report any lost or stolen cards immediately.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Pay attention to billing cycles and call if you do not receive an expected bill in a timely manner. It may mean that an identity thief has diverted the bill.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Place outgoing mail in post office collection boxes only. Even better, consider using&nbsp;<a href="/personal/main/0,,2485_3074,00.html" intlinkid="3074">online banking with bill payment</a>&nbsp;to send your payments. Making payments online can help prevent mail fraud while saving you time and postage.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Shred all of your receipts and bank and credit card statements before disposing of them.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Review your credit report from all three major credit bureaus to make sure that new credit card or other accounts have not been opened in your name. Credit bureau contact information is listed below.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Make sure personal and financial information stored on your personal computers are protected with a password.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>&nbsp;Avoid using automatic login features that save your user name and password; and always log off when you're finished.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Install and use a firewall on your personal computers, especially those connected to the Internet through high-speed DSL or cable modems. A firewall helps prevent hackers from accessing your computer.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Install virus protection software on your computer and make sure it is updated on a regular basis.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Don't give anyone your financial information unless you initiate the contact or are sure with whom you are dealing.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Never disclose your PIN or password to anyone and always safeguard it.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Don't print your Social Security number or driver's license number on your checks.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Don't download files or click on hyperlinks in emails from un-trusted sources.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch out for "phishing" or "spoofing" e-mails that may look like they are legitimate messages, but they are not. The sender attempts to get you to reveal confidential personal information that can be used for identity theft. Union Bank will not contact you via email to ask for or to validate any of your personal information.</p>

<p><span class="Subhead">What to do if you are a victim of identity theft:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<div>Notify Union Bank at the phone number listed on your statement along with any other financial service providers.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>File a report of identity theft with your local police.</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Contact one of the three major credit bureaus to report the incident and ask to have a fraud alert placed on your file. Once the credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the other two credit bureaus will be automatically notified to place fraud alerts, and all three credit reports will be sent to you free of charge. Review your credit reports and notify the bureaus about anything that looks suspicious.</div>
</li>
</ul>

					<font class="bodytext"><ul>
<li>"Phishing" or "Spoofing" is when unsolicited emails appear to be coming from a bank, insurance company, retailers or a regulatory agency, but they are not.</li>

<li>The fraudulent emails require that the recipient "verify" certain information to prevent account suspension, cancellation, interest withholding or some other urgent matter.</li>

<li>These messages look professional and authentic, and may even contain links or pop-up windows that have the appearance of legitimacy.</li>

<li>These sophisticated scams will ask for ATM or Banking Card Numbers, PINs or log-on IDs and personal information such as Social Security Number, Date of Birth, or Mothers Maiden Name; all of which can be used by the criminals to perform an account takeover or even worse, commit identity theft.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please be aware that Union Bank of California WILL NEVER solicit confidential information regarding you or your account(s) via email.</strong></p>

<p><span class="Subhead">Other tips&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid becoming a victim:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Delete emails from unknown parties. Don't even open them.</li>

<li>Do not provide personal information, account numbers, banking or credit card numbers, PINs or log-on IDs through email links or pop-up windows. Either call the institution, or go directly to their web site at the URL you know to be correct.</li>

<li>Invest in spam filtering protection.</li>

<li>NEVER give out any information unless you initiated the contact, and are sure you know with whom you are dealing.</li>

				<tr><td colspan="2" class="bodytop7padding">
					<font class="bodytext"><p>The Nigerian Advance Fee Scam has been around for years. Despite repeat warnings, it continues to draw in many victims. Don’t be one of them.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The scam involves the receipt of an unsolicited letter or email claiming to come from someone who works for the Nigerian Central Bank or from the Nigerian government.</li>

<li>In the letter, the recipient is informed that they are seeking a reputable foreign company or individual into whose account they can deposit funds to facilitate a large transaction, and be paid a percentage of the deal for their participation. Other variations require a "deposit or bond" for a foreign individual to participate in a large construction or other financial transaction.</li>

<li>The scam artist's goal is to lure the victim into thinking that he or she has been singled out to participate in a very lucrative arrangement. The intended victim is reassured of the authenticity of the arrangement by forged or false documents (appearing on Nigerian government letterhead, seals, letters of credit, and bank drafts), or even by arranging a meeting between the victim and "government officials" in real or fake government offices.</li>

<li>Once the victim becomes confident of the potential success of the deal, something goes wrong and the victim is then pressured or threatened to provide one or more large sums of money to save the venture. For example, the "official" will demand an upfront bribe or unforeseen tax/fee to the Nigerian government to be paid before the money can be transferred. If the party isn’t able to send the money, they find "investors" for them. Checks are sent and deposited, instructions are provided to immediately wire the funds out, and by the time the deposited items are returned as counterfeit, stolen or altered, the "contact" disappears. If the victim has the money to send without needing the "investors," the contact stops when the advance fees have been paid.</li>

					<font class="bodytext"><p>Criminals are always finding new ways to scam victims out of their savings. In this version of a lottery scam, people are being asked to respond to an unsolicited mailing or phone call telling them they are being entered into a prize drawing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Victims receive an unsolicited phone call from Canada congratulating them on winning the "big prize" in a National Lottery.</li>

<li>They are told that before they can claim the prize, they must send money to pay for taxes and processing fees.</li>

<li>Victims of lottery scams have lost thousands of dollars as they continue to respond to phone calls demanding payments to cover costs in order to receive their prize.</li>

<li>The fact is, the prize does not exist and victims never receive any winnings in return for their cash.</li>

<li>There are also many types of lottery scams that involve innocent people sending in money up front, waiting to receive the "big payoff."</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive a telephone call from a direct marketer who promises instant lottery prizes, hang up! No lotteries in the U.S. operate this way. People who approach you with stories like this are criminals. They simply want your money and credit card numbers. They will lie to you and sound convincing. Don´t fall victim to lottery scams. Protect yourself and your money.</p></font></td>
