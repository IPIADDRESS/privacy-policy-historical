<h1 align="center"><a name="BM_1_"></a>Privacy and Security </h1>
    <p>I believe very strongly in the right of all individuals to keep information about
    themselves to themselves.&nbsp; Increasingly we seem to be giving away more and more of
    our privacy of our own accord!&nbsp; Big brother is already watching us - but it is
    because we invited him to!&nbsp; </p>
    <p>For example, every time you use your credit card you give away information about where
    you were, at what time, what shop you were in, and what you bought.&nbsp; From this the
    credit card company, or anyone they sell or give that information to, can build up a whole
    profile of your lifestyle.&nbsp; It may seem insignificant, but add that to all the other
    information that people are collecting about you and you quickly realise your life is no
    longer only your affair!</p>
    <p>This may or may not be of concern to you.&nbsp; In either case, I can assure you that I
    will not be adding to the problem.&nbsp; My formal <a href="privacy.html#privacy">Privacy
    Policy</a> (which my lawyer requires me to have) is written out below. Here are some
    additional points that will probably be of interest to you:</p>
    <h4>Shopping Security</h4>
    <p>All orders are processed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>,
    one of the world's leading e-commerce companies, using state of the art encryption, secure
    servers, and fraud detection.&nbsp; We use them as they are able to offer much higher
    levels of security than we, as a small company, could possibly provide.&nbsp; You can have
    full confidence that all information you enter, such as your credit card details are
    entirely safe.</p>
    <h4>Email Security </h4>
    <p>Emails that you send are like postcards - anything you write in them can be viewed by
    anyone who cares to look.&nbsp; Obviously it takes a bit of programming know how to
    intercept people's emails, but it can, and is, being done. &nbsp; Of course, with billions
    of emails whizzing around it is unlikely that someone will pick on yours - unless you are
    including obvious info like credit card numbers.&nbsp; But be especially careful if you
    are emailing from work - the chances are that you are going through their server and all
    your emails will be saved somewhere on the system.&nbsp; They may well be read to make
    sure that you are working at work, instead of doing private correspondence!</p>
    <h4>Javascript </h4>
    <p>The website does use Javascript in order to make it easier to use.&nbsp; These scripts
    do not take over your computer - all they do is to control the way the web pages are
    displayed to you.&nbsp; Javascript can do things like reading your computer's clock to
    display today's date, and determining the type of browser you are using, and the screen
    size.&nbsp; But it cannot read your hard drive and send me, or anyone else, information
    from your files.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>If you are concerned about people getting access to your hard drive, the one to watch
    out for is "Active-X".&nbsp; In the wrong hands that can be truly
    malicious.&nbsp; My site does not use Active-X.</p>
    <h4>Cookies </h4>
    <p>There is even more misinformation about cookies. &nbsp; Cookies are simply small text
    files that are sent from the web server to your computer.&nbsp; They carry the identity of
    the web server from whence they came (e.g. us) and can be read by Javascript.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This means that the Javascript can tell if you already have a cookie from us, which would
    indicate that you have been to this site before.&nbsp; They don't carry viruses, and they
    can't run any programmes - they are just simple text files.&nbsp; To see which cookies you
    have at present, simply do a search (Find Files) on your computer, looking for
    "cookies".&nbsp; Any that you find can be read with Notepad or any other text
    editor.</p>
    <p>My site does use cookies to make it more user friendly, and to process shopping orders.
