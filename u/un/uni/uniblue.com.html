               <p>In those cases where We process on the basis of Your consent (<strong>which We will never presume</strong> but which We shall have obtained in a clear and manifest manner from You), <strong>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT AT ANY TIME</strong> and this, in the same manner as You shall have provided it to Us.</p>
                <p>Should You exercise Your right to withdraw Your consent at any time (by writing to Us at the physical or email address <a href="#privacy-policy.company">below</a>), We will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis exists for processing Your Personal Data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which We are subject) where We would be legally authorised (or even obliged) to process Your Personal Data without needing Your consent and if so, notify You accordingly.</p>
                <p>When We ask for such Personal Data, You may always decline, however should You decline to provide Us with necessary data that We require to provide requested services, We may not necessarily be able to provide You with such service (especially if consent is the only legal ground that is available to Us).</p>
                <p>Just to clarify, <strong>consent is not the only ground that permits Us to process Your Personal Data.</strong> In the last preceding section above We pointed out the various grounds that We rely on when processing Your Personal Data for specific purposes.</p>

                <p><span>Our normal

                    Us to keep certain Personal Data for a certain period of time (in which case We
                    will keep the Personal Data for the maximum period indicated by any such law).
                    For example, any data that can be deemed to be ‘accounting records’ must be
                    kept for ten (10) years. </span></p>
                <p>We would also
                    have to determine whether there are any laws and/or contractual provisions that
                    may be invoked against Us by You and/or third parties and if so, what the
                    prescriptive periods for such actions are (this is usually five (5) years). In
                    the latter case, We will keep any relevant Personal Data that We may need to
                    defend Ourselves against any claim(s), challenge(s) or other such action(s) by
                    You and/or third parties for such time as is necessary.</p>

                    Data is no longer required by Us, We will either securely delete or anonymise

                    uses a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is an element of data
                    (usually a very small file) that a website can send to Your browser, which may
                    then store it on Your computer or mobile device.&nbsp; These cookies allow Us to
                    correctly operate the Site and/or to provide You with web pages or content that
                    are tailored to You. For example, some cookies remember Your custom
                    preferences. This information can, in some cases, be carried from one visit of
                    our Site (or related site) to the next (for example, to help You avoid having
                    to re-enter certain information when You visit the same page later. Some of
                    these cookies require Your consent (as explained <a href="#cookie-policy.non-essential">below</a>.)</p>
                <p>Some cookies are created for each
                    session when You visit Our Site, while others are persistent and may remain for
                    a number of months or years to facilitate Your access to Our Site.</p>
