            <p>Should You exercise Your right to withdraw Your consent at any time (by writing to Us at the physical or email address <a href="#privacy-policy.company">below</a>), We will determine whether at that stage an alternative legal basis exists for processing Your Personal Data (for example, on the basis of a legal obligation to which We are subject) where We would be legally authorised (or even obliged) to process Your Personal Data without needing Your consent and if so, notify You accordingly.</p>
            <p>When We ask for such Personal Data, You may always decline, however should You decline to provide Us with necessary data that We require to provide requested services, We may not necessarily be able to provide You with such service (especially if consent is the only legal ground that is available to Us).</p>

The criteria We use to determine what is ‘necessary’ depends on the particular Personal Data in question and the specific relationship We have with You (including its duration).</p>

For example, any data that can be deemed to be ‘accounting records’ must be kept for ten (10) years.</p>
            <p>We would also have to determine whether there are any laws and/or contractual provisions that may be invoked against Us by You and/or third parties and if so, what the prescriptive periods for such actions are (this is usually five (5) years).

            <h2>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h2>
            <p>Our Site uses a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is an element of data (usually a very small file) that a website can send to Your browser, which may then store it on Your computer or mobile device.  These cookies allow Us to correctly operate the Site and/or to provide You with web pages or content that are tailored to You. For example, some cookies remember Your custom preferences. This information can, in some cases, be carried from one visit of our Site (or related site) to the next (for example, to help You avoid having to re-enter certain information when You visit the same page later. Some of these cookies require Your consent (as explained <a href="#cookie-policy.non-essential">below</a>.)</p>
            <p>Some cookies are created for each session when You visit Our Site, while others are persistent and may remain for a number of months or years to facilitate Your access to Our Site.</p>

            <div id="cookie-policy.purpose" class="section">
            <h2>WHY WE USE COOKIES</h2>
            <p><strong>We absolutely respect Your right to privacy.</strong> We use cookies to ensure the functionality of our Site and to make Your website experience better. You can remove any cookies already stored on Your computer or mobile device (as explained below) but this may prevent You from using parts of this Site or may cause You to see this message, or part thereof, again.</p>
            <p>Apart from the cookies We make use of Ourselves, various third-party cookies may also be stored on Your computer or mobile device, including <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#provision/SignUp/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>. We strongly suggest that You read the cookie policy of any such third-party cookies.</p>

            <h2>ESSENTIAL AND NON-ESSENTIAL COOKIES</h2>
            <p>We divide cookies into two main categories, namely:</p>
            <ol>
            <li id="cookie-policy.essential">
            <h3>ESSENTIAL COOKIES</h3>
            <p>These are strictly necessary to ensure that the Site functions in Your everyday use of it or for Us to provide You with the service(s) You expect from Us. Cookies used for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication will also be considered as essential cookies. <strong>We do not require Your consent to use such essential cookies but You may still block or delete them (<a href="#cookie-policy.delete-or-disable">see below</a>.)</strong></p>
            <p>Some examples of <strong>essential cookies</strong> as found in the European Commission’s EU Internet Handbook (see<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm</a>) are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>USER-INPUT</strong> cookies (session-id) such as first‑party cookies to keep track of the User’s input when filling online forms, shopping carts, etc., for the duration of a session or persistent cookies limited to a few hours in some cases;</li>
            <li><strong>AUTHENTICATION</strong> cookies, to identify the User once he has logged in, for the duration of a session;</li>
            <li><strong>USER-CENTRIC SECURITY</strong> cookies, used to detect authentication abuses, for a limited persistent duration;</li>
            <li><strong>MULTIMEDIA CONTENT PLAYER</strong> cookies, used to store technical data to play back video or audio content, for the duration of a session;</li>
            <li><strong>LOAD-BALANCING</strong> cookies, for the duration of session;</li>
            <li><strong>USER-INTERFACE CUSTOMISATION</strong> cookies such as language or font preferences, for the duration of a session (or slightly longer);</li>
            <li><strong>THIRD-PARTY SOCIAL PLUG-IN CONTENT-SHARING</strong> cookies, for logged-in members of a social network.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="cookie-policy.non-essential">
            <h3>NON-ESSENTIAL COOKIES</h3>
            <p>These are not required for the essential functioning of the Site, although they may greatly enhance Your experience of using Our Site. For example, non-essential cookies may be used for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>PREFERENCES.</strong> These cookies would remember Your custom preferences. For example, this helps You avoid having to re-enter certain information when You visit the same page later;</li>
            <li><strong>MARKETING.</strong> Here, the cookies would be used to gather information about Your browsing habits allowing Us to provide You with more relevant information and material that would be of interest to You;</li>
            <li><strong>STATISTICS.</strong> These help Us gather information about users on Our Site(s), such as when You first visited the Site and/or how often You access it and at what particular time. These also include cookies that log how You came across the Site, using which search engine or other link.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>WE SHALL ONLY PLACE NON-ESSENTIAL COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE IF YOU CONSENT TO THAT SPECIFIC CATEGORY OF COOKIE</strong> being placed by way of a pop-up on relevant areas of our Site the first time you visit it and possibly subsequently (if necessary) and/or by accepting this Cookie Policy (or other similarly effective mechanism). This will not prevent You from deleting or disabling cookies by modifying Your browser settings <a href="#cookie-policy.delete-or-disable">as explained below</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>YOU MAY WITHDRAW SUCH CONSENT FOR NON-ESSENTIAL COOKIES <em>AT ANY TIME</em> BY THE SAME METHOD IN WHICH YOU GAVE IT TO US.</strong></p></li>
