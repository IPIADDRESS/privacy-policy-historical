                <h4><b>INFORMATION THAT WE INDEPENDENTLY DERIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SITE</b></h4>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Aside from any information you may actively disclose to us, there is other, less obvious, information that we might gain from you. Generally, we use such information for internal purposes such as to improve the content of our Web pages and/or refine the layout of our pages.  This is generalized information that does not compromise your privacy; no information of a personal nature is gathered in this process.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Computer Information.</b> We automatically query your computer for information about your computer system such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may have received, or operating system type -- to help us fit our services to your individual needs and to help us diagnose problems you may be having with your system. We use an identifier in the form of a user ID to give you access to subscription or premium areas.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Aggregate Information.</b> Finally, our system automatically gathers information about the areas visitors to our site utilize and view. We use this navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our visitors as a group use the site(s) so that we can make our sites better. We do not share any of this information outside of the district if it in anyway contains information of a private or personal nature, and on average the information gathered is anonymous in nature.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are pieces of information that our Web Site transfers to your computer's hard drive in order to make your experience on our Site more efficient.  While other sites may use them to gather information that may be considered private, the few cookies in use by Unit 5 do not gather information of a private nature.  Cookies used only serve to automate certain functions like Polls and Message Boards, and are limited to storing information for a set period of time after which they are discarded.  Cookies built and uploaded to your computer by Unit 5 do not contain code that compromise your privacy, and they are not retrieved and read by Unit 5 except when needed to verify use of services.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>IP Addresses.</b> An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider.  McLean County Unit 5 collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our Site. Each time you connect to our Site and each time you request one of our pages, our server logs your IP address. Although we log your session with us, we will not normally link your IP address to anything that can enable us to identify you. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, Site, users or others.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>WHEN WE MAY BE FORCED TO DISCLOSE</b></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>McLean County Unit 5 may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) McLean County Unit 5's rights or property or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  McLean County Unit 5 may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Linking to other sites is an integral part of the functionality of the Internet and therefore of the McLean County Unit 5 sites. Any link to a page which displays a URL of a non-McLean County Unit 5 site in the address window of your browser, is a link to a site outside of our service.  These links may be found all over Unit 5 Online and other Unit 5 hosted websites, both for informational and educational purposes. These other sites may send their own cookies to you, collect data or solicit personal information. Although we monitor the sites that we link to and make every attempt to ensure their quality, we cannot guarantee and are not responsible for the content of outside sites. For more information on safety on the Internet for children, Internet 101's excellent article is a good starting place.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information on other Web sites, for example via message boards or chat, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While McLean County Unit 5 strives to protect our visitors' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of any information you disclose at other Web sites and you do so at your own risk.</p>
