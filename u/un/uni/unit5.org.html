                <ul>
                  <li>We do not use any information about where you personally go on our 
					site, nor do we give such information out to third parties;</li>
                  <li>We do not give out your name, telephone number, or other personal information, unless you (or, if you are a child under the age of 13, your parent) authorize us to do so;</li>

These areas include:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><b>Online Job Applications.</b>  McLean County Unit 5 and the Human Resources department do accept electronic job applications.  These applications require that users provide private and personal information as part of the application process for employment with McLean County Unit 5.

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><b>Professional Development Academy Registration.</b>  McLean County Unit 5 and the Professional Development Academy offers staff members the ability to register for training and education courses via Unit 5 Online.

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><b>Staff Registration</b>. Staff members registered with Unit 5

No employee of Unit 5 will ask for an ID or Password from staff or student inside these message boards, and all information about user accounts is protected and not shared with third parties.

                <h5><b>INFORMATION THAT WE INDEPENDENTLY DERIVE FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SITE</b></h5>
                <p>Aside from any information you may actively disclose to us, there is other, less obvious, information that we might gain from you. Generally, we use such information for internal purposes such as to improve the content of our Web pages and/or refine the layout of our pages.  This is generalized information that does not compromise your privacy; no information of a personal nature is gathered in this process.</p>
                <p><b>Computer Information.</b> We automatically query your computer for information about your computer system such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may have received, or operating system type -- to help us fit our services to your individual needs and to help us diagnose problems you may be having with your system. We use an identifier in the form of a user ID to give you access to subscription or premium areas.</p>
                <p><b>Aggregate Information.</b> Finally, our system automatically gathers information about the areas visitors to our site utilize and view. We use this navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our visitors as a group use the site(s) so that we can make our sites better. We do not share any of this information outside of the district if it in anyway contains information of a private or personal nature, and on average the information gathered is anonymous in nature.</p>
                <p><b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are pieces of information that our Web Site transfers to your computer's hard drive in order to make your experience on our Site more efficient.  While other sites may use them to gather information that may be considered private, the few cookies in use by Unit 5 do not gather information of a private nature.  Cookies used only serve to automate certain functions like Polls and Message Boards, and are limited to storing information for a set period of time after which they are discarded.  Cookies built and uploaded to your computer by Unit 5 do not contain code that compromise your privacy, and they are not retrieved and read by Unit 5 except when needed to verify use of services.</p>
                <p><b>IP Addresses.</b> An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider.  McLean County Unit 5 collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our Site. Each time you connect to our Site and each time you request one of our pages, our server logs your IP address. Although we log your session with us, we will not normally link your IP address to anything that can enable us to identify you. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, Site, users or others.</p>
                <p><b>WHEN WE MAY BE FORCED TO DISCLOSE</b></p>
                <p>McLean County Unit 5 may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) McLean County Unit 5's rights or property or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  McLean County Unit 5 may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
