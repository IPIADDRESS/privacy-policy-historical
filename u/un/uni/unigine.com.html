        <p>UNIGINE respects your concerns about privacy. We want you to understand the kinds of information we may collect, how we intend to use that information, with whom your information may be shared, and how you can opt-out of such uses or correct or change such information. When you use our websites, services, products, and content (“Services”) you agree to our collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of information as described in this policy, so please review it carefully.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>These definitions should help you understand this policy. When we say “we,” “us,” “our,” and “UNIGINE,” we are referring to UNIGINE HOLDING S.À.R.L. When we say “you,” we are referring to a person who visits any of our websites or uses our products, services. “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, email address, gender, occupation or other demographic information. If we are not (or at least not without a disproportionate amount of time and effort) able to relate a direct link to you personally, this information is not personal data.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to unigine.com, sim.unigine.com, payment.unigine.com, developer.unigine.com, benchmark.unigine.com, store.unigine.com (each a “Website” and together the “Websites”).</p>
<h3>Information We Collect and Receive</h3>
<p>We generally collect or receive information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or through use of our services, and (3) other parties, such as social networks, may provide information to us. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.</p>
<h4>(1) Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide</h4>
<p>You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use our websites, products and services. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with information also may change. The following are some examples of situations in which you may provide information to us:</p>
<ul><li>Creating an account to use our websites, services or products;</li><li>Purchasing something from us or otherwise engage in a transaction with us;</li><li>Registering for or participate in special events;</li><li>Participating in any of our promotions;</li><li>Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from us;</li><li>Complete a survey;</li><li>Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.</li></ul><p>The personal information we collect from you will vary depending on the services you are using, the websites you are visiting, and how you access those services and websites. The information you provide to us may include your name and your email address(es). If you choose to make a purchase, we will collect payment card information such as your card’s payment account number and expiration date. Sometimes we ask for your phone number, your postal address, your billing address.</p>
<h4>(2) Information Collected Automatically When You Use Our Websites, Products and Services</h4>
<p>We collect some information automatically when you visit our websites or use our services and products. If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information. We typically aggregate the data that we collect automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals. We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from our services and products. We may also utilize Google Analytics and Yandex Metrics in the collection, compilation and analysis of information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content.</p>
<p>This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information. We use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud, and conducting data analytics. The type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:</p>
<ul><li>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);</li><li>Usage information and statistics about your interaction with our websites, services and products, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type and other usage statistics;</li><li>Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience;</li><li>The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device’s IP address.</li></ul><p>Please note that if certain features on our websites are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of our websites or others’ websites over time. These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.</p>

<h3>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>Personal data we received are stored on specially protected servers. Access is restricted to a limited number of authorized persons who need the access in order to administer our websites or ensure their proper functionality, especially with regard to technical support. We employ industry-standard administrative, physical and electronic measures to safeguard personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access. We encrypt the transmission of all personal information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and only store that information in secured data centers.</p>
<p>Please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.</p>
<h3>Transfers of Information</h3>
<p>As part of our international operations, we may transfer information about you to any jurisdiction where we do business. If you are an EU resident, we will transfer your personal information for the above purposes to our service providers that may be located outside of the EU. The laws in those jurisdictions may not necessarily provide the same level of data protection compared to the laws in your country. However, we will treat your personal information as subject to the protections described in this policy. When you use our websites, products and services, you acknowledge that we may transfer information about you as described in this policy.</p>
<h3>Period for Which the Personal Data Will Be Stored</h3>
<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>
<h3>Notice of Breach of Security</h3>
<p>If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you, then Unigine will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response.</p>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<p>This policy does not apply to websites not owned or controlled by Unigine, even if we link to them or they link to us. Because Unigine does not operate those other sites and services, we can’t take responsibility for the privacy practices of the entities that operate them. We recommend that you consistently check privacy policies to understand an operator’s practices.</p>
<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should check it periodically. If we make changes that are material we will provide you with appropriate notice before such changes take effect.</p>
<h3>Questions &amp; Concerns</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this policy, or if you want to update, delete, or change any Personal Information we hold, or you have a concern about the way in which we have handled any privacy matter, please email to us&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@unigine.com">privacy@unigine.com</a>&nbsp;or contact us at:</p>
