<p><strong>EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Participation</strong><br>Unica recognizes that the EU has an "omnibus" data protection regime established pursuant to the European Union Directive (95/46/EC) (the "Directive") and that Switzerland has enacted the Federal Act on Data Protection.&nbsp; The Directive and Swiss law generally restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information about individuals in the EU and Switzerland to the United States.&nbsp; To address this restriction, Unica adheres to the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") with respect to personally identifiable information about customers' customers and internal users.&nbsp; Specifically, Unica may obtain access to information about its customers' customers and internal users in the EU and Switzerland in connection with providing its products and services or other additional information ("European Processor Information").&nbsp; Unica's customers act as the data controller for any European Processor Information collected in the EU and Switzerland and subsequently transferred to Unica in the United States.&nbsp; Unica acts as a data processor on behalf of its customers with respect to such European Processor Information and accordingly carries out Unica's customers' instructions with regard to the collection, processing, and protection of European Processor Information.</p>
<p>Unica maintains reasonable security measures to protect European Processor Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.&nbsp; Unica also makes reasonable efforts to keep European Processor Information reliable for its intended use, accurate, current and complete in relation to the form in which Unica's customer provided the European Processor Information to Unica.&nbsp; With respect to any inquiries concerning access to European Processor Information, customers' customers and internal users may first wish to contact their own company with questions regarding the European Processor Information shared with Unica, as that might be the most efficient means of addressing such issues.</p>
<p>Individuals may contact the Unica Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below with respect to the Safe Harbor.&nbsp; Additional information regarding the Safe Harbor may be obtained on the US Department of Commerce website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.&nbsp; In addition, if any individual located in the EU or Switzerland experiences an issue regarding the European Processor Information that Unica holds about him or her, the individual may contact the local data protection authority for further information.</p>
