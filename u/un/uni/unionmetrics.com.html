<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
<p><strong>(a) Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Union Metrics will never sell your email address or any other personally identifiable information, to any third party without your permission. We may store personally identifiable information in locations outside the direct control of Union Metrics (for example, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Any personally identifiable information you elect to make publicly available on our websites and/or applications (such as posting comments, reviewing items, etc.) will be available to others. Except as described in this Section, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party except consultants working on our behalf, without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> The Union Metrics site registration form may require users to give Union Metrics contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). Union Metrics uses your contact information from the registration form to send you information about Union Metrics and promotional material from some of Union Metrics’ partners. Your contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary. Union Metrics may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on the Union Metrics website and/or applications, show you content that Union Metrics thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with third parties ONLY on an aggregate basis.  Furthermore, Union Metrics shall have the right to retain records of all data pertaining to use of the website and applications including, but not limited to, usage, activity logs, and click-throughs.  Union Metrics may disclose such data to third parties provided it is grouped with other Union Metrics users’ data and is presented in an aggregate form.</p>
<p><strong>(c) We May Be Required to Share Your Information.</strong> Union Metrics reserves the right to disclose information when required by law, such as by a subpoena or other legal proceedings. Union Metrics may also disclose your information if we reasonably believe it necessary to (i) comply with requests of law enforcement or other applicable law; (ii) to enforce any agreement between you and us; (iii) to protect the security and integrity of our site, applications, or services; and/or (iv) to protect us, our users or others</p>
<p><strong>(d) What Happens in the Event of a Change of Control:</strong> We may be involved with an acquisition or divestiture of our business, products or services. Information we maintain including names and email addresses, and other information related to the Union Metrics service may be sold or transferred in connection with such transaction. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of our business or assets. You will be notified via email and/or a notice on our site of any applicable change in ownership or uses of your information.</p>
<p>(e) Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting. We allow advertisers to display advertising on our sites and applications. Our advertisers may use technology such as cookies to gather information about your activities on multiple sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your activities and interests. The only way to opt out of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is through the settings in your browser or mobile device. Please review your browser or mobile device information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools (to learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org). If you access the Union Metrics service, websites and/or applications on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through the settings.

<h2>How We Store and Process Your Information</h2>
<p>The information collected by Union Metrics may be processed and/or stored in the United States, European Union Member Nations, Canada, or any other country in which Union Metrics or its affiliates or service providers maintain operations. Union Metrics may transfer information that we collect, including personally identifiable information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction of domicile to other countries or jurisdictions. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws restricting transferring of data, please note that we will comply with laws applicable to us.</p>
<p>We want to make you aware that pursuant to the EU Data Protection Laws, Union Metrics shall act as a Processor or Subprocessor, and not a Controller with respect to any personal information collected on behalf of our customers.  If you are a customer who uses our services and you collect personal information on citizens within the European Economic Area, we ask that you contact privacy@unionmetrics.com to request a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”).  This DPA implements the GDPR’s Article 28 terms for processors and also incorporates the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (processors) of 2010 (also known as “model processor clauses” or “SCC 2010”) to facilitate the lawful transfer of Personal Data from the EU to outside of the EU, where necessary and as required. </p>
<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>Union Metrics is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, and therefore we use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between Union Metrics and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place designed to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Union Metrics’ control. Union Metrics’ servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems. However, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the Union Metrics service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical or managerial safeguards. If you have any questions about security on our website and/or application, you can contact us at privacy@unionmetrics.com. We may use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our website and/or application. However, once you choose to furnish the website and/or application with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand website and/application usage and to improve the content and service. We also may use cookies to offer you products or services. You have many choices with regards to the management of cookies on your computer. All major browsers allow you to block or delete cookies from your system. To learn more about your ability to manage cookies, please consult the privacy features in your browser.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Union Metrics may create links to other web sites. Union Metrics will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual’s right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated or authorized by Union Metrics may have links leading to our site. Union Metrics cannot control these links and Union Metrics is not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.</p>
