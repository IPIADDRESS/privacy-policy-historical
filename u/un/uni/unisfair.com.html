We value the privacy of our customers, users, and any individual that accesses or uses the InterCall websites, products, and services (collectively, the "Services"). This Policy discloses InterCall's practices with respect to the collection, processing, use and disclosure of user information collected through the access and use of InterCall Services. This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information collected and processed by InterCall whether in electronic, paper or verbal format. The virtual event Service allows certain third party organizers and contributors to host virtual events (each, a "Sponsor"). InterCall collects the information described below on behalf of such Sponsors. You should consult the privacy policies of each relevant Sponsor to determine how they may handle your information.
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>"Personal Information" or "Information" means information that (1) is transferred from the European Economic Area ("EEA") or Switzerland to the United States or maintained in the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to, a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Personal Information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual's health. </p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>In connection with the access and use of InterCall Services, we may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when, among other things, you register on the InterCall website, use one of our Services, fill out a survey, make a request for information, or enter a sweepstakes or contest through the InterCall website. We may also capture your telephone number when you use our conferencing Services. Please be aware that any information you choose to share on any publicly available portion of the Services or with third parties, including without limitation your personal page, chat messages, forum posts, blogs, resumes, job applications, business cards, or any other information that you provide to Sponsors or other attendees, may be collected and used by others without restriction. We will use the Personal Information you provide us in these circumstances to operate the InterCall website, to the extent required for the delivery of the InterCall Services, to satisfy InterCall's legitimate business interests (such as customer analysis and internal marketing study and analysis), and to provide information you request from the InterCall website ("Primary Use"). </p>
<p>Important Notes Regarding Virtual Events: For virtual events, depending upon the type of event, some of the following fields may be displayed throughout the event: first and last name, company, User ID, and User avatar/image. The Sponsor may enable attendees to search for and find other attendees based on a User's registration information. If you associate your actual name or other personally identifiable information with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed such information will be able to personally identify your activities on the event. In addition, any information you choose to share on any publicly available portion of a virtual event may be collected and used by others without restriction. résumés that you have posted to or within a virtual event may be available to all Sponsors of any booth, even if you have not filed a job application with such Sponsor. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these Sponsors to determine how they will handle your information. InterCall's Privacy Policy does not apply to such Sponsors or their use of your information. InterCall does not control Sponsors' use of your information. If you would prefer that InterCall not disclose your personal information to any such Sponsor, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@intercall.com">privacy@intercall.com</a>. Please be reminded, however, that any information you publicly display or share or that is accessible through the event may already be in such Sponsor's possession, despite such opt-out choice.</p>
<p>Unless you instruct us not to do so, InterCall may also use the Personal Information you provide us to contact you regarding additional or new services and features offered by InterCall, special offers by InterCall, or important information regarding InterCall ("InterCall Secondary Use"). In addition, with your permission, we may provide your Personal Information to other companies who may contact you regarding products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, but that are not directly related to InterCall or the InterCall website ("Third Party Secondary Use").</p>
<p>InterCall may provide your Personal Information to vendors that assist InterCall in processing such Information or in case you purchase services of Third Parties from InterCall ("Third Party Services"). InterCall requires such vendors to enter into agreements with InterCall prohibiting disclosure of the information to others and restricting its use to providing the contracted services of InterCall.</p>
<h2>Choice</h2>
<p>As we noted above, we will not use your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for any Third Party Secondary Uses unless you affirmatively choose to participate in such Secondary Uses. You may also stop delivery of informational or promotional mail from us by following the instructions included in the informational or promotional mail itself. </p>
<h2>Access</h2>
<p>When you register to use any of the Services offered by InterCall, InterCall will send you a confirmation of your registration showing the Personal Information we obtained from your registration. Also, we will take reasonable steps to give you the opportunity to correct inaccuracies in the Personal Information we retain concerning you and delete Personal Information concerning you upon your request, unless the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. </p>
<h2>International transfers and the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor</h2>
<p>By accessing and using the Services and providing us with the requested Personal Information, you consent to the collection and use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy including transfers from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States or elsewhere where privacy protections may not have been deemed "adequate" by the EEA or Switzerland. Individuals who do not consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal information as outlined in this Policy should not provide any Personal Information through the InterCall Services and website. </p>
<p>In accordance with our commitment to protect personal privacy, InterCall adheres to the Safe Harbor Frameworks concerning the transfer of Personal Information from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles and the fifteen FAQs that make up the E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the Swiss Safe Harbor Framework published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the "Principles") with respect to all such Personal Information. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. This Privacy Policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of Information we gather, how we process and use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that Information.</p>
<h2>Transfers</h2>
<p>Unless you have already consented to such disclosure, prior to disclosing Personal Information to a third party, InterCall shall notify you of such disclosure and allow you to opt out of such disclosure. InterCall shall ensure that any third party for which Personal Information may be disclosed subscribes to the Principles or are subject to law providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and agree in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>InterCall shall take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. The Personal Information we collect from you is stored in operating environments that employ reasonable security measures and that are not available to the general public. InterCall is not responsible for unauthorized access to such Information by hackers or others that obtain access through illegal measures, in the absence of negligence on the part of InterCall. Further, the other websites you may access through the InterCall website may have different security practices and you should familiarize yourself with those practices. InterCall cannot guarantee the security of Information transmitted via the Internet.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the confidentiality and security of passwords InterCall issues to you. If you believe a third party has obtained your password in an unauthorized manner, please notify us promptly.</p>
<h2>Data Integrity</h2>
<p>InterCall shall only process Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, InterCall shall take reasonable steps to ensure the Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.</p>
<h2>Enforcement/Complaints</h2>
<p>InterCall uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and periodically verifies the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Principles. </p>
