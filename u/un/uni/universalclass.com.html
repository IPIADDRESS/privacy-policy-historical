<b>Universal Class, Inc. takes your privacy seriously.</b>
Please feel free to review our Privacy Policy: 

<p>Because we want to provide you with the most efficient and enhanced service, we may request 
information about you.  However, we will not offer any information about you to any outside company 
or individual unless we receive your prior consent. 

</p><p><b>About this Privacy Policy</b>
</p><ul style="padding-left:25px;">
<li>This Privacy Policy covers Universal Class, Inc.'s treatment of personally identifiable information that 
UniversalClass collects when you are anywhere on UniversalClass.com sites, and when you use any of 
UniversalClass.com's services. 
</li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies, schools, or other organizations that 
UniversalClass does not own or control, or to people that UniversalClass does not manage or employ.  
UniversalClass.com contains several links to other sites and UniversalClass.com is not responsible for 
the privacy practices or the content of those sites.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Information We Collect and Track </b>

</p><p>
</p><ul style="padding-left:25px;">
<li><b>General Usage Information</b>.  Universal Class collects information about all users collectively, 
such as what areas users visit and what services members use. This data is automatically retrieved.  
This type of general information is not used to identify specific users, but in an aggregate form to 
help us analyze traffic patterns and enhance our service to better serve our users and advertisers.
</li><li><b>UniversalClass.com Registration</b>.  When you register at Universal Class, Inc., we ask for 
personal information from you (name, email, etc.).  Once you login to our services with your 
username and password (that identifies your registration data), you are not anonymous to us.  
Both General Usage Information and any personal details you provide to us is used to enhance and
 customize content, identify (and in some cases validate) you when you post content, participate in a class,
  or access any of our member-privileged services.

</li><li><b>Creating, Joining, Taking, or Using our Virtual Classroom Environment</b>.  When you create, join, take, or use our Virtual Classroom 
Environment, you are not anonymous to us, the instructor(s) within the class, or the student(s) within the class you have enrolled. 
Personally identifiable information about you such as your Universal Class username, your first and last name, and 
your email address is made available to fellow class participants within the class you have joined.  
This information is released and shared with your fellow classmates to better enhance your online education and to promote free and 
open inquiry, and to hold class participants personally responsible for their work and behavior within the online class.  
We are <b>not responsible</b> of how fellow class participants decide to use this information 
about you.

</li></ul>

<p><b>What We Do with Collected Data</b>

</p><p>Data collected from Universal Class members (people who have filled out our registration form 
and logged in) is used to identify the member in order to allow that member to join and participate in our online classes. 
Information we gather and collect about anonymous users and members 
logged into our service is also used to provide you with content that may be of interest to you or 
relevant to your needs.  Additionally, we may show advertisements to you that are relevant to your 
demographic information.  Universal Class requires revenue from advertising in order to provide 
you with its many services. In order to help enhance the effectiveness of online ads, Universal Class
may provide advertisers with general demographic information on an aggregate basis (but no personal 
information that would identify you would be disclosed to another company).

</p><p>Data on your activity within the Virtual Classroom Environment is provided to the instructor(s) of the class you are taking. 
This data includes your username, page(s) accessed, date and time of accessing pages, and any class-related activities (assignment submissions, exam submissions, etc.). 
This data is only released to the instructor and staff of Universal Class, and not to other people or companies. We do 
not release any data to the instructor that would pose a potential security threat to our service. As a service to the instructor and to better promote online education, we provide logs of 
class activity to the instructor of the class to help him/her better improve his/her intellectual environment, to better understand 
traffic flow, and to determine the level of class participation by individuals students. While Universal Class does not sell or give its member list to 
other persons or companies, it is important to note that (if you choose to use our Virtual Classroom Environment) fellow class participants  may 
obtain some identifiable information about you.

</p><p><b>A Note About Cookies</b>

</p><p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it 
can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some specific 
information and to help maintain "state". A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie 
files created by other websites.  Universal Class, Inc. may use cookies to help identify you when you 
visit our site.  All of our member-privileged services require the use of cookies, but our public sites 
do not.  For example, our homepage, schools, departments, and viewing of all public information does not 
require cookies, whereas joining or creating a class will require the use of a cookie.

</p><p><b>Sharing of Information We Collect</b>

</p><p>We do not share any of the information we collect about individual users with outside companies or 
people not employed at Universal Class, Inc.  However, we may share some general demographic information 
about Universal Class visitors collectively with advertisers or partners, but nothing that is personal 
or identifiable to an individual.  If you use our service as an expert, information such as your name, 
your expertise, and your resume may be available to the general public.  Universal Class is not responsible 
for information you choose to make public on its web sites, and if you do not want this information to be
public, select to use this service "privately" in the "Accounting Settings" area or the "Edit Profile" area. It is equally 
important to note that if you choose to use our Virtual Classroom Environment (by either creating, teaching, joining, or using 
one or any of our online classes) some personally identifiable information is released about you to class participants.  This information is 
limited to your first and last name (the name you entered when you signed up on UniversalClass), email address, and your Universal Class 
username.  As mentioned previously, any activity you do within the Virtual Classroom Environment is made available to the instructor in 
table-formatted logs.  This information is only released to the instructor(s) of the classroom to better help the instructor(s) 
determine traffic flow and individual student participation.  We provide this information in the spirit of promoting and enhancing education online and the student experience.  This 
information is not released to other individuals or companies, and we are not responsible for how the instructor decides to 
use this information.

</p><p><b>Third Party Advertising Tracking</b></p>

<p>
Universal Class uses Google to measure the performance of its advertising. To measure advertising performance,
Google uses small strings of text (known as cookies) that are placed on your computer when you click on our ads.
Cookies typically remain active on your computer for about 30 days. 
If you visit certain pages of the Universal Class's website during that period, Google and Universal Class will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google.
If you'd like to know more about how Google handles information gathered from the use of cookies, please read their <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. 
</p> 

<p><b>Security of Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>
We work hard to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts any sensitive or financial information you submit. 
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to log off when finished using a shared computer.
</p>

<p><b>Selecting a Public Profile</b>

</p><p>If you decide to create or update your profile to be "<b>public</b>" then your areas of expertise, your full name, 
and any other information you may have submitted about yourself will be made public to Universal Class members, as well as the 
Internet, and as well as the general public. By making your profile "public" you completely accept that personal information 
about yourself is no longer made private and you are no longer considered "anonymous".

</p><p><b>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</b>

</p><p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is extremely important to us. For this reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from anyone who identifies 
themselves as being under the age of 13. Our website is not constructed in any way, shape, or form to attract anyone 
under the age of 13. Universal Class, Inc. is an adult service for adult learners.

</p><p><b>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</b>

</p><p>If you have registered on the Universal Class service as a Universal Class member, you have access to your personally 
identifiable information. You can update or correct this information under "My UniversalClass" by clicking on the link
"<a href="http://members.universalclass.com/myclasses/secure/profile.htm">Edit Profile</a>". Your profile is unique and secured by your
Universal Class Username and Password.

</p><p><b>Release of Student Records</b>

</p><p>Once you have completed an online course, your student records are available for up to 5 years from the date of completion in the form of 
	an online certificate (if you purchased the certificate option), and available under the "My Transcripts" area. You personally control and are responsible
	for any release of this information to other parties. You can set whether or not your certificate is available to other people using the 'Share My Award' feature located
	on the online version of your certificate. 
	For example, you can select whether or not it is private (viewable only by you) or public (viewable to anyone) and/or whether it is password protected (viewable only to people who have the password).

</p><p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b>

</p><p>UniversalClass.com has taken several security measures in order to protect the information under our 
control.  All personal information we collect is stored on machines owned by Universal Class, Inc. 
at a secured location in order to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the equipment 
or its data.
