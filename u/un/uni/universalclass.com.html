<b>UniversalClass.com Inc. takes your privacy seriously.</b>
Please feel free to review our Privacy Policy: 

<p>Because we want to provide you with the most efficient and enhanced service, we may request 
information about you.  However, we will not offer any information about you to any outside company 
or individual unless we receive your prior consent. 

</p><p><b>About this Privacy Policy</b>
</p><ul>
<li>This Privacy Policy covers UniversalClass.com’s treatment of personally identifiable information that 
UniversalClass collects when you are anywhere on UniversalClass.com sites, and when you use any of 
UniversalClass.com’s services. 
</li><li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies, schools, or other organizations that 
UniversalClass does not own or control, or to people that UniversalClass does not manage or employ.  
UniversalClass.com contains several links to other sites and UniversalClass.com is not responsible for 
the privacy practices or the content of those sites.
</li></ul>

<p><b>Information We Collect and Track </b>

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><b>General Usage Information</b>.  UniversalClass.com collects information about all users collectively, 
such as what areas users visit and what services members use. This data is automatically retrieved.  
This type of general information is not used to identify specific users, but in an aggregate form to 
help us analyze traffic patterns and enhance our service to better serve our users and advertisers.
</li><li><b>UniversalClass.com Registration</b>.  When you register at UniversalClass.com Inc., we ask for 
personal information from you (name, email, gender, etc.).  Once you login to our services with your 
member ID and password (that identifies your registration data), you are not anonymous to us.  
Both General Usage Information and any personal details you provide to us is used to enhance and
 customize content, identify (and in some cases validate) you when you post content, join or teach a class,
  or access any of our member-privileged services.

</li><li><b>Creating, Joining, Taking, or Using our Virtual Classroom Software</b>.  When you create, join, take, or use our Virtual Classroom 
Software, you are not anonymous to us, the instructor(s) within the class, or the student(s) within the class you have enrolled 
or created.  Personally identifiable information about you such as your UniversalClass.com member ID, your first and last name, and 
your email address is made available to fellow class participants within the class you have joined or created.  
This information is released and shared with your fellow classmates to better enhance your online education and to promote free and 
open inquiry, and to hold class participants personally responsible for their work within the online class.  
We are <b>not responsible</b> of how fellow class participants (instructors and/or students) decide to use this information 
about you.

</li></ul>

<p><b>What We Do with Collected Data</b>

</p><p>Data collected from UniversalClass.com members (people who have filled out our registration form 
and logged in) is used to identify the member in order to allow that member to join or create classes 
and to give the power to that member to delete classes he/she may have created, or remove him/herself 
from participating in a class.  Information we gather and collect about anonymous users and members 
logged into our service is also used to provide you with content that may be of interest to you or 
relevant to your needs.  Additionally, we may show advertisements to you that are relevant to your 
demographic information.  UniversalClass.com requires revenue from advertising in order to provide 
you with free services. In order to help enhance the effectiveness of online ads, UniversalClass.com 
may provide advertisers with general demographic information on an aggregate basis (but no personal 
information that would identify you would be disclosed to another company).

</p><p>Data on your activity within the Virtual Classroom is provided to the instructor(s) of the class you are taking or 
teaching.  This data includes your member ID, page(s) accessed, date and time of accessing pages, and the type of web 
browser you are using.  This data is only released to the instructor, and not to	 other people or companies. We do 
not release any data to the instructor that would pose a potential security threat to our service (we do not and will not release 
ip addresses or "cookies"). UniversalClass.com considers the instructor the owner of the content and activity within the Virtual Classroom, 
and as a service to the instructor and to better promote online education, we provide logs of 
class activity to the instructor of the class to help him/her better improve his/her intellectual environment, to better understand 
traffic flow, and to determine the level of class participation by individuals students. While UniversalClass does not sell or give its member list to 
other persons or companies, it is important to note that (if you choose to use our Virtual Classroom software) fellow class participants  may 
obtain some identifiable information about you.

</p><p><b>A Note About Cookies</b>

</p><p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it 
can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some specific 
information and to help maintain "state". A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie 
files created by other websites.  UniversalClass.com Inc. may use cookies to help identify you when you 
visit our site.  All of our member-privileged services require the use of cookies, but our public sites 
do not.  For example, our homepage, schools, departments, and viewing of all public information does not 
require cookies, whereas joining or creating a class will require the use of a cookie.

</p><p><b>Sharing of Information We Collect</b>

</p><p>We do not share any of the information we collect about individual users with outside companies or 
people not employed at UniversalClass.com.  However, we may share some general demographic information 
about UniversalClass visitors collectively with advertisers or partners, but nothing that is personal 
or identifiable to an individual.  If you use our service as an expert, information such as your name, 
your expertise, and your resume may be available to the general public.  UniversalClass.com is not responsible 
for information you choose to make public on its web sites, and if you do not want this information to be
public, select to use this service "as a student" in the "Manage Interests" area or the "Edit Profile" area. It is equally 
important to note that if you choose to use our Virtual Classroom software (by either creating, teaching, jonining, or using 
one or any of our online classes) some personally identifiable information is released about you to class participants.  This information is 
limited to your first and last name (the name you entered when you signed up on UniversalClass), email address, and your UnviersalClass 
member ID.  As mentioned previously, any activity you do within the Virtual Classroom is made available to the instructor in 
table-formatted logs.  This information is only released to the instructor(s) of the classroom to better help the instructor(s) 
determine traffic flow and individual student participation.  We consider instructors owners of their online class and class activity, 
and so we provide them with this information in the spirit of promoting and enhancing education online.  This 
information is not released to other individuals or companies, and we are not responsible for how the instructor decides to 
use this information.

</p><p><b>Selecting a Public Profile</b>

</p><p>If you decide to create or update your profile to be "<b>public</b>" then your areas of expertise, your full name, 
and any other information you may have submitted about yourself will be made public to UniversalClass members, as well as the 
Internet, and as well as the general public. By making your profile "public" you completely accept that personal information 
about yourself is no longer made private and you are no longer considered "anonymous".

</p><p><b>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</b>

</p><p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is extremely important to us. For this reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from anyone who identifies 
themselves as being under the age of 13. Our website is not constructed in any way, shape, or form to attract anyone 
under the age of 13. UniversalClass.com Inc. is an adult service for adult learners.

</p><p><b>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</b>

</p><p>If you have registered on the UniversalClass.com service as a UniversalClass member, you have access to your personally 
identifiable information. You can update or correct this information under "My UniversalClass" by clicking on the link
"<a href="http://my.universalclass.com/secure/profile.htm">Edit Profile</a>". Your profile is unique and secured by your
UniversalClass Member Id and Password.


</p><p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b>

</p><p>UniversalClass.com has taken several security measures in order to protect the information under our 
control.  All personal information we collect is stored on machines owned by UniversalClass.com Inc. 
at a secured location in order to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the equipment 
or its data.

With grant writing skills, you have the option of working as an independent contractor or obtaining a full-time position with an organization. Community non-profit organizations are always on the look-out for someone who will help them find grant funding and to assume short-term grant writing projects. The goal of Grant Proposal Basics is seeing students in the community and in business gain a sense of accomplishment and usefulness in grant writing knowledge and skills. The purpose of the course is to teach students about grant writing, so that each student will become knowledgeable and learn basic skills about seeking financial assistance in the form of non-refundable grants for projects. The student will learn how to locate agencies and organizations that have funding available, how to contact them, how to read the requirements for preparing a grant proposal, and general guidelines for preparing a grant proposal. After taking this course, the student should feel like he or she can begin to prepare grant proposals for an individual project, or to be a useful resource to a non-profit organization or business as part of a grant writing proposal team. A grant proposal writer may average $22 to $30 an hour. Annual salaries range from $31,000 to $50,000. An independent contractor can average more than that, because benefits are not included in a contractor's salary. For a 2-week job, you can earn $2,000 to $3,000. But, Grants101 is not a get-rich quick scheme. It's about job satisfaction, having a sense of making a valuable contribution where needed, seeing the results of your work, receiving fair compensation, and being needed. One of the most satisfying things about grant proposal writing is seeing a project through, beginning to end. The person doing grant proposal writing begins by searching for funding, locating funding, working with a team who wants funding for a project, learning how to match the project needs with available funding, helping the team organize a grant proposal, and hopefully seeing that proposal become accepted as a grant that will help fund the project's needs. It's a wholly creative and satisfying job. Grants101 brings basic information to the student who wants to learn new skills to broaden opportunities in times of economic uncertainty, or to enhance skills in a present position. Who should enroll? Individuals who are in a variety of job positions and those who are independent workers will benefit from the course. This includes managers, technical writers, administrative support personnel with promotion potential, teachers, other professional specialists, artists, and students. A recent job search on the Internet turned up 450 jobs relating to proposal preparation across the country. One of those job opportunities could be yours. This 5-part session will provide basics to those seeking funding for worthy causes. 1) How to know what the eligibility requirements are to receive grant funding. 2) How to find governmental and private funding grant makers. 3) How to learn about the requirements for preparing a grant proposal. 4) How to justify the need for financial assistance with statistical data when writing a grant proposal. 5) Finally, what are the component parts to preparing a grant proposal? </font> <font size="-2"><a href="http://experts.universalclass.com/palcommunication" target="NEW">Patricia Tegtmeier</a></font> </li><li><a href="http://universalclass.com/i/socialsciences/spiritual/classes/5914.htm" target="NEW"><b>QiGong 8 Movements</b></a> <font size="-2" color="#BE1E01">(Hot Class!)</font> <font size="-2"><b>3 Stars.</b> Discover 8 basic movements of QiGong that will help to build and balance your body's energy system and promote health and fitness in your life.

This course reveals facts about the publishing industry that most writers don't know about. The pros and cons of all four publishing routes are compared: large publishers, small publishers, vanity presses and self-publishing. It provides sample guides that show you not only the standard submission formats for writing manuscripts, query letters, proposals and synopses, but also when each of them are used and what specific key elements editors look for and are impressed by, in those submissions. The writer is walked through each step of the publishing process, and given tools for doing so effectively. Secrets of the publishing world are exposed, revealing how writers can get into hot water with editors, agents and publishers, without even knowing it. Unspoken ethics, rules of etiquette, taboos, stereotypes and behavior publishers expected of writers, are discussed at length. Finally, the course focuses on various important aspects of the publishing contract. Royalties, advances, free book copies, rights, right of first refusal, creative input, aspects of performance and duration are addressed, as well as what they need to be aware of and alerted to in negotiating a contract. This course is aimed at writers who have a serious interest in getting published, but need to know the steps for doing so and can benefit from some savvy inside tips along the way. It does an excellent job of taking the mystery out of getting published and the industry, itself.
