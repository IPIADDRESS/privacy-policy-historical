<div class="privacy-policy-description">It's important that you read and understand the Privacy Policy of Unmetric and the way it affects you. We've tried to keep things as simple as possible with minimal amounts of legalese speak. In a nutshell, the document details what information we collect from you, what information we store from you, our relationship with 3rd party sites and how it affects you and the region in which these policies are governed.</div>

<div class="privacy-policy-mono-line"></div>

<div style="overflow:hidden;" class="privacy-policy-content">


Unmetric, Inc (the "Company") is committed to ensuring the privacy of those who use the <a href="http://www.unmetric.com">Unmetric.com</a> website ("Users"), located at <a href="http://www.unmetric.com">http://www.unmetric.com</a> (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes what information is collected from Users and how that information is used and disclosed. By using the Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy.
<br><br><br>
<div class="privacy-policy-content-heading">AUTHORIZED USERS</div><br>
The Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old you may not register with or otherwise provide personal information to our Site.
<br><br><br>
<div class="privacy-policy-content-heading">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</div>
<br>

<div style="float:left; width:100%;">
<div style="float:left; width:25px;"><b>1</b></div>
<div style="float:left; width:580px">
<b>User Provided Information.</b> You may provide to Company what is generally called "personally identifiable" information if you register. In addition, Company may give you the option to provide us with certain demographic information about yourself.<br><br><br>
</div>
</div>

<div style="float:left; width:100%;">
<div style="float:left; width:25px;"><b>2</b></div>
<div style="float:left; width:580px">
<b>Aggregate Data.</b> Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data. Company uses aggregate data to help identify trends and understand member needs so we can provide better features and services. Company may also share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, and/or functionality on the Site.<br><br><br>
</div>
</div>


<div style="float:left; width:100%;">
<div style="float:left; width:25px;"><b>3</b></div>
<div style="float:left; width:580px">
<b>General User Data.</b> General User Data, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the date and time of your visit, may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies" (small files that are stored on your computer by a website to give you a unique identification). Cookies also keep track of services you have used, record registration information regarding your login name and password, ensure you do not repeatedly see advertisements, record your preferences and keep you logged into the Site. We treat general user data as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifying information mentioned above and, in those cases, will only use it as aggregate data.
<br><br><br>

<div style="float:left; width:100%;">
<div style="float:left; width:25px;"><b>4</b></div>
<div style="float:left; width:580px">
<b>Third Party Collected Data.</b> We may use, and allow third parties to use, web beacons on the Site for legitimate purposes. Web beacons are small, graphic images on web pages, web-based documents, or in email messages that allow us or third parties to monitor who is visiting the Site or if the email has been read. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information.<br><br><br>
</div></div>

<div class="privacy-policy-content-heading">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</div>
<br>
We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business. In all cases we limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information, and we require these parties to use any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We are not responsible for any information you provide to third party vendors directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.
<br><br>
We do not share personal information with other third-party organizations for their marketing, advertising or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.
<br><br>
Except as stated in this Policy, we do not share personal information about Users with third parties unless we reasonably believe that doing so is legally required or is in Company's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others.
<br><br>
In addition, information about our Users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
<br><br><br>
<div class="privacy-policy-content-heading">EXTERNAL WEBSITES</div><br>
Our Site may contain links to external websites.

<div class="privacy-policy-content-heading">SECURITY</div>
 <br>
We use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee protection of all information in all cases, for example we cannot guarantee protection against interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration, or that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Additionally, we have absolutely no control over the security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business with.
<br><br>

By using the Site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site. Company may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us.
