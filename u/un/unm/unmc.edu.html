  <p>
  <b>Understanding Your Health Information </b>&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Each time you visit a hospital, clinic, physician, or other health care 
  provider, a record of your visit is made.&nbsp; Typically, this health record 
  contains your medical history, symptoms, examination and test results, 
  diagnosis, treatment, care plan, insurance, billing, and employment 
  information.&nbsp; This health information, often referred to as your health 
  record, serves as a basis for planning your care and treatment and is a vital 
  means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to 
  your health care.&nbsp; Your health information is also used by insurance 
  companies and other third-party payers to verify the appropriateness of billed 
  services.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>
  <b>Our Responsibilities </b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;We are required by law to:</p>
  <ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
    <li>Maintain the privacy of your health 
    information.</li>
    <li>Provide you with an additional 
    current copy of our Notice upon request.  </li>
    <li>Abide by the terms of our current 
    Notice.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will not use or disclose your 
  health information without your written authorization, except as described in 
  this Notice. Such authorization may be revoked in writing at any time except 
  with respect to any actions we have taken in reliance on it.<br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
  Examples of Using Health Information for Treatment, Payment and Health Care 
  Operations <i><br>
  <br>
  We will use and disclose your health 
  information for treatment purposes</i></b><i>.<br>
  </i>For example:&nbsp; Information obtained 
  by a nurse, physician or other member of your health care team will be 
  recorded in your record and used to determine the course of treatment.&nbsp; Health 
  care team members will communicate with one another personally and through the 
  health record to coordinate care provided.&nbsp; We will also provide your 
  physician or subsequent health care provider with copies of various reports 
  that should assist him or her in treating you in the future.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>We will use and disclose your 
  health information for payment purposes.<br>
  </i></b>For example:&nbsp; A bill may be 
  sent to you or a third-party payer.&nbsp; The information on or accompanying the 
  bill may include information that identifies you, as well as your diagnosis, 
  procedures, and supplies used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may disclose health information about you 
  to other qualified parties for their payment purposes.&nbsp; For example, if you 
  are brought in by ambulance, we may disclose your health information to the 
  ambulance provider for its billing purposes.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <b><i>We will use and disclose your 
  health information for health care operations.<br>
  </i></b>For example:&nbsp; Members of the 
  medical staff, the risk or quality improvement manager, or members of the 
  quality improvement team may use information in your health record to assess 
  the care and outcomes in your case and others like it.&nbsp; This information will 
  then be used in an effort to continually improve the quality and effectiveness 
  of health care we provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, we will furnish your health 
  information to other qualified parties for their health care operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  ambulance company, for example, may want information regarding your condition 
  to help them know whether they have done an effective job of stabilizing your 
  condition.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Teaching:</i></b>&nbsp; 
  As the primary teaching site for UNMC, residents, fellows, and students in 
  medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, allied health and graduate studies, 
  may be assisting with your care under the supervision of a licensed health 
  care provider as a part of their professional health care training program.&nbsp;
