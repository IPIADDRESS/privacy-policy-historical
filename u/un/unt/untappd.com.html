<p><strong>I. Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information Untappd (“Untappd,” “us,” “we” or “our”) collects through https://untappd.com, https://business.untappd.com, https://store.untappd.com, the Untappd mobile applications and various related services (the “Site”), and how we collect, use, and share that information. This Privacy Policy does not govern our collection of personal information through any other website or other means, other than through the Site.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal data, such as your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number, shall be undertaken consistent with the requirements of applicable privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide to users and potential users of our website information about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process and to advise data subjects of their rights. Whether we serve as the data controller or processor, Untappd has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of personal data processed through the Site. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so please understand that absolute protection is not assured.</p>
