<div align="left" style="margin: 20px 75px 10px;"><h3>General </h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">Uno Restaurant Holdings Corporation (referred in this Privacy 
  Policy as the "Company") respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This Privacy
  Policy ("Policy") outlines the information the Company may collect
  from visitors to our websites hosted in the United States and how we may use
  and disclose that information. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">We encourage you to read this Policy before using any of our websites. Your
  use of a website of the Company signifies that you agree with all terms of
  this Policy. Please do not use our websites if you disagree with any part of
  this Policy. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>What personal information do we collect and why do we collect it?</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company may collect personal information about you (such as your name,
  postal address, telephone number, date of birth, company name and email address)
  that you provide voluntarily. You ordinarily are not required to register or
  provide personal information in order to access our websites, although certain
  sections of our websites may require registration. In addition, if you choose
  to contact us to ask a question we will collect your personal information so
  that we can respond to your question.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company may collect personal information online for all legal purposes,
  which include, but are not limited to:</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 95px 10px;"><h3>On-line Surveys.</h3> 
The Company conducts on-line surveys and other activities
  that may require online registration. Persons wishing to participate in those
  activities are asked to provide certain personal information. Some of the information
  requested for this purpose is optional, but other information, such as email
  address, is mandatory because it will be needed distribute promotions (such
  as coupons). Also, some activities may require the selection of a user ID and
  password by the participating individual. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 95px 10px;"><h3>"Contact Us" and Comment Features.</h3> The Company encourages visitors
  to its websites to contact us with questions and comments. Email addresses
  and other information of persons using these features may be collected in order
  to facilitate our responses to those inquiries.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 95px 10px;"><h3>Purchases of Company Products. </h3>The unotogo.com website and other Company websites
  may offer individuals the opportunity to purchase products online. In connection
  with those purchases, customers may be asked to submit personal information,
  name, address, telephone number and email address, that is required to complete
  the transaction. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 95px 10px;"><h3>Special Promotions and Product Information.</h3> The Company also may offer you
  the opportunity to provide you with email updates and announcements concerning
  our products and special promotions. Personal information you have provided
  to the Company may be used to facilitate those communications.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>When do we disclose the personal information we collect?</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">Except as provided herein, the Company will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose
  personal information about you to unaffiliated third parties.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">We may disclose personal information you have provided through our websites
  to persons or companies that we retain to carry out promotions and other activities
  for which you have registered or in which you have otherwise asked to participate.
  We also will disclose personal information if required by law, including compliance
  with warrants, subpoenas or other legal process.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company requires persons and companies to which it discloses personal
  information to restrict their use of such information to the purposes for which
  it has been provided by the Company and not to disclose that information to
  others. The Company cannot be responsible, however, for any damages caused
  by the failure of unaffiliated third parties to honor their privacy obligations
  to the Company. Similarly, the Company is not responsible for the privacy policies
  and practices of other websites that are linked to our websites.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">In addition to these limited disclosures of personal information, the Company
  may provide its affiliates or unaffiliated third parties with aggregate information
  about visitors to our sites. For example, we might disclose the median ages
  of visitors to our websites, or the numbers of visitors to our websites that
  come from different geographic areas. Such aggregate information will not include
  information of any individual visitors to our websites. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company may provide personal and other information to a purchaser or successor
  entity in connection with the sale of the Company, a subsidiary or line of
  business associated with the Company, or substantially all of the assets of
  the Company or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>Special Note for Parents</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company takes seriously its obligations under the Children's Online Privacy
  Protection Act concerning the collection of personal information from children
  under the age of 13. The Company's websites are not targeted to children. The
  Company does not knowingly accept personal information from children under
  the age of 13.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">Parents should be aware that information that is voluntarily given by children
  or others in chat sessions, email exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may
  be used by other parties to generate unsolicited email or other contacts. The
  Company encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible
  use of the Internet. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>How do we protect your personal information?</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company takes measures to prevent unauthorized intrusion to its websites
  and the alteration, acquisition or misuse of personal information by unauthorized
  persons. However, the Company cautions visitors to its websites that no network,
  including the Internet, is entirely secure. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>How can you update your personal information?</h3></div>
  <div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">If you register for a website facility under which the Company may send you regular communications (such as the "Uno Insider's Club"), you may update your
  personal information by selecting the "Update your Profile" link. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>What other information do we collect?</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">When you access and interact with one of our websites, we may collect certain
  information often referred to as "clickstream data." Such data may
  include the type of Internet browser and operating system you are using, the
  pages and information you accessed on our site, the total time spent on our
  site, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site.
  Also, where you have previously identified yourself in the registration process
  as affiliated with a particular business or organization, we may record the
  fact that a representative of your business or organization visited the site,
  along with other clickstream data concerning that visit. Clickstream data will
  not be used to identify you personally and will not be associated or correlated
  with any site visitor in a personally-identifiable manner.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>Information placed automatically on your computer -- Cookies</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">When you view one of our websites, we may store certain information on your
  computer. This information may be in the form of a small text file called a "cookie" and
  can help us improve your experience with our websites in many ways. For example,
  cookies allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences.
  Notably, our websites use cookies to help understand which parts of our websites
  are most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend
  there. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them, and are unable
  to execute any code or virus.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">Also, where specific programs associated with our websites require a user
  ID and password, you have the option of requesting that we save your user ID
  and password so that you will not have to re-enter that information the next
  time you access the website. This function is accomplished by the placement
  of a cookie.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard
  drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please
  refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these
  functions. Please be aware, however, that some features and programs of our
  websites may be unavailable to you if cookies are erased or blocked. </div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">Some uses of cookies in connection with our websites may be under the control
  of unaffiliated entities that the Company retains for the management of certain
  programs and fulfillment of specific visitor/customer requests. The Company
  requires these entities to confine their use of cookies to the uses permitted
  by this Policy, but the Company cannot be responsible for third party uses
  of cookies.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>Offline v. Online Practices</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">This Policy applies solely to the Company's information-gathering and dissemination
  practices in connection with its websites in the United States, and does not
  apply to any of our practices conducted offline or outside of the United States.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;"><h3>Changes to this Policy</h3></div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">This Policy is the sole authorized statement of the Company's practices with
  respect to the collection of personal information through the Company's websites
  and the subsequent use and disclosure of such information. Certain third party
  websites may be linked to the Company website. These third party
  websites include their own privacy policies. Please refer to these policies
  when using one of the linked websites.</div>
<div align="left" style="margin: 10px 75px 10px;">The Company may revise this Policy from time to time. You should bookmark
