                          Over the years UNFCU has worked hard to earn your trust, 
                          and we will continue to be vigilant in maintaining the 
                          privacy of our members. To that end, we have instituted 
                          policies and procedures intended to ensure that your 
                          personal information is handled safely and responsibly. 
                          As you will see in the statement of our privacy practices, 
                          we take this responsibility very seriously and are committed 
                          to providing you with the highest level of member service 
                          and confidentiality.</p>
                        <p>It is our promise that UNFCU will collect only the 
                          information necessary to deliver to you quality products 
                          and services. Furthermore, we are continually assessing 
                          new technology as it becomes available to continue to 
                          best protect your privacy.</p>
                        <p><b>A</b>. What information do we collect and what may

                          UNFCU collects, uses and retains information about you 
                          only for specific business purposes where it is necessary 
                          in administering our business for you and in providing 
                          competitive products, services, and other opportunities 
                          that will satisfy your financial service needs. </p>
                        <p>We collect the following “nonpublic personal 
                          information” about you from the following sources:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Information we receive from you on applications 
                            or other forms, such as your name, address, social 
                            security number, assets, and income;</li>
                          <li>Information about your transactions with us, our 
                            affiliates, or others, such as the account balance, 
                            payment history, and parties to transactions; and</li>
                          <li>Information we receive from a consumer-reporting 
                            agency, such as your creditworthiness and credit history.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At times, it becomes necessary to provide to third 
                          parties nonpublic personal information about you that 
                          we collect in order to facilitate transaction processing. 
                          Examples of these third parties would include title 
                          insurance companies, statement production vendors, collection 
                          agencies, credit card service bureaus, and cheque service 
                          providers, which provide support or services for one 
                          or more of our products. In addition, UNFCU may provide 
                          nonpublic personal information about you to specially 
                          selected third parties who offer enhanced products and 
                          services such as GlobalPhone, Incorporated. All these 
                          third parties have been carefully chosen by UNFCU and 
                          agree to safeguard your confidential information with 
                          the same commitment to privacy as we have.</p>
                        <p><b>B</b>. What happens if my information is incorrect 
                          or incomplete?<br>
                          We have implemented procedures to help ensure that member 
                          financial information is maintained in a manner that 
                          will ensure it is accurate, current and complete. If 
                          you have reason to believe that your information is 
                          incomplete or inaccurate, we invite you to contact us 
                          so we can correct our records promptly.</p>
                        <p><b>C</b>. Who has access to my information?<br>
                          For your protection, UNFCU staff is required to verify 
                          the identity of the individual or member who is requesting 
                          the account information. Only you and verified joint 
                          accountholders are entitled to obtain information about 
                          your account. We thank you for your assistance in cooperating 
                          with our identification procedures when you contact 
                          us. </p>
                        <p>We limit staff access to confidential member information 
                          only to those employees with a business reason for knowing 
                          such information. UNFCU educates its staff so that they 
                          understand the importance UNFCU places on confidentiality 
                          and member privacy. In addition, we maintain security 
                          standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized 
                          access to confidential information about you. Member 
                          privacy is also addressed in the UNFCU Employee Handbook, 
                          and any staff who violates this policy will be subject 
                          to appropriate disciplinary measures.</p>
                        <p>We do not reveal specific information about your accounts 
                          or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated 
                          third parties for their independent use, unless:</p>

                          <li>The information is provided to a credit bureau or

                          unauthorized access?<br>
                          UNFCU maintains and follows strict security standards 
                          and procedures designed to guard against unauthorized 
                          access to and disclosure of confidential member information. 
                          Whenever reasonably possible, we will use security-coding 
                          techniques to protect against unauthorized access to 
                          your personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity 
                          of communications and transactions, and protect your 
                          confidentiality.</p>
                        <p><b>E</b>. Are there any exceptions that I should know

                        <p>We may also share information with the Investment Centre 
                          in order to provide services necessary to maintain your 
                          accounts. Examples of such information may include information 
                          about your identity, your transaction history with UNFCU, 
                          your current financial condition, and information obtained

                        <p><b>F</b>. How can I avoid having my information shared 
                          with nonaffiliated parties?<br>
                          If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal 
                          information about you to a nonaffiliated third party, 
                          you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may 
                          direct us not to make those disclosures (other than 
                          disclosures permitted by law). If you wish to opt out, 
                          you may indicate your choices on the enclosed Opt Out
