  <h1>Privacy Policy<br>
  </h1>
  <p> This policy covers the following  matters (amongst others): the collection of personal information; the use of  that personal information; the legal bases for the processing of that  information; disclosures of that personal information to third parties;  international transfers of personal information; and the use of cookies on the  website.<br>
    <br>
    In any event, there are many  aspects to data protection compliance. Publishing a privacy policy or statement  containing the relevant information is only one aspect - albeit an important  aspect - of compliance.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Section 1:  Introduction</strong><br>
  <br>
    Section 1.1<br>
  <br>
  "Personal data" is  defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR:<br>
  "(1) 'personal data' means  any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data  subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,  directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a  name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one  or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,  economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person".<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Section 2:  Cookies </strong><br>
  The inclusion of this statement in  your privacy policy will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy  and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as regards  consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such  consent is included on the Information Commissioner's website  (http://www.ico.gov.uk).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Consent of cookies is completed by a drop down menu upon visiting the website.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We have a whole page detailing our partners and their cookies policies. This can be found at <a href="cookies.html">cookies page</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><br>
    Section 3:  How we use your personal data</strong><br>
  <br>
    Article 13(1) of the GDPR provides  that:<br>
  "(1) Where personal data  relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller  shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject  with all of the following information: ... (c) the purposes of the processing  for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;  (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate  interests pursued by the controller or by a third party".<br>
    Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR  provides that:<br>
  "(1) Processing shall be  lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:  ... (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests  pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are  overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data  subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data  subject is a child."<br>
  <br>
    Section 3.1<br>
    Article 14 of the GDPR, which  applies where personal information is not obtained from the data subject,  provides that information about "the categories of personal data  concerned" must be supplied to data subjects.<br>
    Article 13 of the GDPR, which  applies where personal information is obtained from the data subject, does not  include an equivalent provision.<br>
    Nonetheless, we have included references  to general categories of data in this document, because this facilitates the  identification of particular purposes of processing and the legal bases of  processing - information which does need to be provided under Article 13.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Section 4:  Providing your personal data to others</strong><br>
  <br>
    Article 13(1)(e) of the GDPR  requires that where personal data are collected from the data subject, the data  controller must provide the data subject with information about "the  recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data".<br>
    Equivalent rules for data  collected from someone other than the data subject are in Article 14(1)(e).<br>
  <br>
    Section 4.1</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> Your personal data isnâ€™t shared  with any other companies by us.<br>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Section 5:  International transfers of your personal data</strong><br>
    <br>
    Article 13(1)(f) of the GDPR  requires that data controllers disclose to data subjects "where  applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a  third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an  adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in  Article 46 [transfers subject to appropriate safeguards] or 47 [binding corporate  rules], or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1) [limited transfers for  compelling legitimate interests], reference to the appropriate or suitable  safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have  been made available".</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>We do not transfer your personsonal data with any  international organisation.<br>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
