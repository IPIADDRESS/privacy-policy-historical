    <div class="page-header bg bg-legal"><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></div>

    <p>Unfuddle LLC ("Unfuddle") operates several websites including, but not limited to, Unfuddle.com and its respective subdomains (collectively the "Unfuddle Websites"). "You" or "Your" refers to visitors to the Unfuddle Websites and users or participants of the Unfuddle Websites and the Services (as defined in the Terms of Use). It is Unfuddle's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating the Unfuddle Websites. By visiting the Unfuddle Websites and utilizing our Services, You are accepting the practices described in Unfuddle's Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), and agree to be subject to Unfuddle's Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").</p>

    <h3>Collection of Non-Personally-Identifying and Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    <p>Like most website operators, Unfuddle collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Unfuddle's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Unfuddle's visitors use the Unfuddle Websites. From time to time, Unfuddle may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

    <p>Unfuddle also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Unfuddle does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

    <p>Certain visitors to the Unfuddle Websites choose to interact with Unfuddle in ways that require Unfuddle to gather personally-identifying information. Personally-identifying information may include your name, home or work address, billing address, telephone number, age and gender. The amount and type of information that Unfuddle gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at the Website to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Unfuddle – by purchasing access to Unfuddle Services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process billing transactions. In each case, Unfuddle collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Unfuddle. Unfuddle does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

    <p>Unfuddle may collect and analyze certain information automatically: the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect Your computer to the internet; login; email address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; registration history; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from the Unfuddle Websites, including date and time; cookie number; pages You viewed, or what You searched for.
  Unfuddle may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Unfuddle may monitor the most popular features on the Unfuddle Websites. Unfuddle may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Unfuddle does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described herein.</p>

    <h3>Use of Your Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
  
    <p>If You are a registered user of an Unfuddle website and have supplied Your email address, Unfuddle may occasionally send You an email to provide You with information and services You request, to tell You about new features and other products and services, to solicit Your feedback, or just keep You up to date with what is going on with Unfuddle and our Services. Unfuddle primarily uses our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If You send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), Unfuddle reserves the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to Your request or to help us support other users. Unfuddle takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personally-identifying information.</p>
    
    <p>The Unfuddle Websites and Unfuddle Services, by their nature, facilitate communication and collaboration between website users.
