If you wish to correct or remove your account information please follow the procedures set forth below in the section titled "Can I Update or Remove My Account Information?"</p>
<p><strong>b. Information collected by Cookies</strong><br>We also make use of website "cookies" to help you use our services more easily and to help us continuously improve our site and our service to you. A "cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer to help our Site "remember" information about you to make it easier and more efficient to use our Site. Our Site employs session cookies. A session cookie does not remain on your computer after you close your web browser window. Our session cookies contain none of your personal information and cannot be used to track you around the Internet. Our session cookies can only be used by this Site and they only exist for the duration of your visit. Depending on the settings in your browser, you may have the option to deny the session cookie; however, doing so may negatively impact upon the performance of the Site or restrict us in better serving your needs and interests. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</p>
<p><strong>II. HOW IS MY INFORMATION USED?</strong><br><strong>a. User Identification</strong><br>For our sites that offer user registration, we may retain this information on a secure server so that on re-visiting our Site, you will not need to re-enter that information. We may use this information in an aggregated form to measure number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and other relevant statistics. We collect this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site.</p>
<p><strong>b. Contacting You Concerning Promotions and New Products</strong><br>We may request you to "opt-in" to receive certain communications from the Site. We will not send unsolicited messages to you concerning promotions or new products or other marketing material unless you have opted-in. If, after you have opted-in, you no longer wish to receive such communications from us please follow the procedures set forth below in the section titled How Can I "Opt-out" of Receiving E-mail Communications. Please note that your request to stop receiving these communications may not prevent us from sending such messages that were generated prior to the time we were able to process your request.</p>
<p><strong>c. Use of Your Information</strong><br>At times, we may request you to provide personally identifiable information to identify you as a user of the Site and to assist and speed the completion of transactions on the Site.

We may vary the content you receive in future visits to the Site based on your preferences and activities.</p>
<p><strong>d. Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br>We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any persons or entities outside of our company, nor lease, license, sublicense, rent, transfer, disclose, disseminate or otherwise grant access to such information unless:<br>(i) You have been given an opportunity to "opt-in" and have agreed to opt-in to such disclosure of your information;<br>(ii) We must share your information in order to provide a product or service that you have ordered or requested, in which case we will require that any third person or entity we use to fulfill your order agrees that it does not have the right to use your information other than to fulfill your order or request; or<br>(iii) We are required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other requirement of law which requires disclosure of your information.</p>
<p><strong>e. Disclosure of Aggregate Information</strong><br>We may combine your personally identifying information and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities for our internal use. For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through the Site in a particular geographic region or to track purchasing trends. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality information through more accurate marketing and advertising of the Site. We may share aggregated information concerning our users, without attribution of personal information, to other companies with whom we conduct business.</p>

You can safely enter your credit card and personal registration information and it cannot be read in transit to our server. We also employ many security procedures to protect your information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.<br>Regardless of the precautions taken by us we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.<br><em>What You Can Do To Protect Your Information?</em><br>(i) Use only secure websites when disclosing your information.&nbsp;<br>(ii) Avoid using easy to figure out access and personal ID (PIN) codes.<br>(iii) Never respond to unsolicited requests for your social security number or financial information.<br>(iv) Do not disclose your passwords to the Site or your account information to any other person.<br>(v) Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>

If you provide any information to parties who operate websites that are linked to or from this Site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review other websites' policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information. Under no circumstances shall we have any liability whatsoever for the activities conducted by or at any website accessed from or through the Site.</p>
<p><strong>V. INFORMATION FROM PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13</strong><br><strong>NOTICE: Visit&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.onguardonline.gov/"><strong>www.OnGuardOnline.gov</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for tips from the Federal Trade Commission on protecting kids' privacy online.</strong><br>We do not seek to collect personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received such information online from a child under the age of 13, we will delete it from our records. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personally identifiable information to us. If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 13 who has provided personally identifiable information to us, please inform us by contacting us at info@unknwn.com&nbsp;and we will remove such information from our database. If you are concerned about your children's use of the Site, you may use web-filtering technology to supervise or limit access to the Site.</p>
<p><strong>VI. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong><br>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.<br>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy Policy) a Privacy Policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this Privacy Policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.<br>As stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy Policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy Policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.<br><br></p>
<p><strong><span>VII. GENERAL</span></strong><br><strong>I.
