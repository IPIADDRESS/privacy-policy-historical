        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<div class="manage">
            <p id="liko0">UnHub
					cares about your privacy and takes it very seriously. Please read the
					following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the
					UnHub website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this
					Privacy Policy.</p>
					<h4 id="liko1">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h4>
					<p id="liko2">This
					Privacy Policy covers UnHub's treatment of personal information
					that UnHub gathers when you are on the UnHub website and when
					you use UnHub services.</p>
					<p id="liko3">This policy does not apply to
					the practices of third parties that UnHub does not own or control,
					or to individuals that UnHub does not employ or manage. </p><h4 id="liko4">What personal information about users does UnHub collect?</h4>

					<p id="liko5">We only collect
					personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. We
					do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the
					purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by
					you. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>Information
					you provide to us. We receive and store any information you enter on
					our website or provide to us in any other way. <p id="liko6">We collect limited information including your email address. You can choose not to
					provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to
					take advantage of many of our special features. The personal
					information you provide is used for such purposes as registration.&nbsp;
					
					</p><p id="liko7">Automatic
					information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever
					you interact with us. UnHub automatically receives and records
					certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including
					your IP address, UnHub cookie information, and the page you
					requested. UnHub uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems
					with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</p>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites
					anonymously. While UnHub will not be able to provide you with a
					personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be
					aware that these programs are available.<h4 id="liko10">What about cookies?</h4>
					<p>A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you first visit a website.
					As with most website cookies, our cookies include an identification number that is unique to the computer
					you are using. This identifier helps us better understand our user base and how they are using our site and
					services.</p>
					<p id="glqd">We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as recognizing you when you visit the site, displaying the site
					according to your chosen user settings and maintaining the security of your account. We may also use the cookies
					to collect aggregated information about the use of UnHub to maintain, analyze and improve the service.</p><h4 id="liko14">Will UnHub share any of the information it receives?</h4>

					<p id="liko15">We neither rent
					nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal
					information only as described below.</p>
					<p id="liko16">Protection of
					UnHub and others: We may release personal information when we
					believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that
					law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or
					protect the rights, property, or safety of UnHub, our employees,
					our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
					companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
					reduction.</p>
					<p id="liko17">With your consent: Except as set forth above, you
					will be notified when your personal information may be shared with
					third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s)
					for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to prevent
					the sharing of this information by opting out.</p>
					<h4 id="liko18">Is information about me secure?</h4>
					<p id="liko19">Your
					UnHub account information is protected by a password for your
					privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized
					access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you
					have finished using a shared computer.</p>
					<h4 id="liko20">What choices do I have?</h4>

					<p id="liko21">As
					stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but
					then you may be unable to use certain features on our website, such as managing profile links on your UnHub page.</p>
					<p id="liko22">You are able to add or
					update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What
					personal information about users does UnHub collect?" section
					above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy
					of the unrevised information in our records.</p>
					<p id="liko23">You may request deletion of your UnHub account by sending an email to <a title="privacy@unhub.com" href="mailto:privacy@unhub.com" id="igio">privacy@unhub.com</a>.
					This removes all of your past UnHub usage from public view.</p>
					<p id="liko25">As
					explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of
					browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting
					new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a
					new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that
					if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take
					advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>
					<h4 id="liko26">Conditions of use</h4>

					<p id="liko27">If
					you decide to visit UnHub website, your visit and any possible
					dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a title="Terms of Use" id="liko28" href="/a/terms">Terms of Use</a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of Delaware state law.</p>
					<p id="liko29">If you have any other questions about our privacy policy, shoot an email to <a title="privacy@unhub.com" href="mailto:privacy@unhub.com" id="igio">privacy@unhub.com</a>.</p>
