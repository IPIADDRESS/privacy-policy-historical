                           <p>Undertone is an advertising network that may deliver advertisements to the websites you visit. Undertone understands that your online privacy is important to you. We have created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect on this website, when you visit our customer's (referred to as "Advertisers") websites and when we serve advertisements on our network of websites owned by third-party publishers (collectively, the "Undertone Site Network"), how such information is used, and how it is shared with third parties if shared at all. </p>
                           <p><strong>Please read this privacy policy carefully. Use of the Undertone Site Network, this website and your sharing of information with us is subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. By using the Undertone Site Network, this website or sharing information with us, you give your agreement to this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us as further described below.</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not govern or extend to Intercept Interactive's customer form business in which a web visitor completes a form or provides personal information as a response to an ad, including offers and promotions ("Customer Form Ads"). That is addressed by a separate privacy policy found at this link: <a href="http://www.interceptinteractive.com/aboutus/privacy.php" target="_blank">Customer Form Privacy Policy</a>.</strong></p>
                           <p>The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the website visitor or consumer. The terms "Undertone," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Undertone Networks, and the companies under its control (such as subsidiaries), or under common control (such as parent companies, or companies owned by its parent company) (collectively, "Undertone Entities").</p>

                                Information We Collect</h2>
                           <h3>Ad Delivery &amp; Reporting Across Multiple Sites</h3>
                           <p>
                                As part of our ad delivery and reporting, we log page views and collect information for the purpose of delivering ads or providing advertising-related services, including providing a specific advertisement based on a particular type of browser or time of day; statistical reporting in connection with the activity on a website; and tracking the number of ads served on a particular day to a particular website. To do so, we collect information about the type of browser and operating system of website visitors, as well as the domain name, day and time of visit, and page(s) visited. We do so across multiple web domains owned or operated by different entities (each, a "Site").</p>
                           <h3>Relevant Advertising</h3>
                           <p>                                We want to deliver more relevant advertising to you. Delivering more relevant advertising to you and other website visitors allows website owners to generate more advertising revenue. This revenue pays for the free content that they may publish for you, or free services that they may deliver to you. It also means that you are more likely to see online advertising that meets your interests.</p>
                           <p>In an effort to deliver relevant advertising to you, we collect data across multiple web domains owned or operated by different entities to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in advertising online ("Online Behavioral Advertising" or "OBA"). For example, we can analyze aggregate, anonymous data to determine that a visitor of a particular Site at 6:30PM is more likely to be interested in Pizza, or antique cars, or a classic movie. We can then serve an ad to the web page the visitor is viewing that offers a discounted Pizza, car show tickets, or classic movie DVD—importantly—without ever knowing the identity or personal information of the visitor.</p>
                           <p>If you do not wish to benefit from relevant advertising, please feel free opt out OBA as described in the paragraph titled "OBA Opt-Out", below.</p>
                           <h3>Internet Technology</h3>
                           <p>
                                We collect the information described above by using log files, web beacons and cookies. We often engage or cooperate with service and technology companies to collect this information. While this tracking and collection technology is commonly used, you might not be familiar with it, and we would like to explain it:</p>
                           <ul>
                                <li>"Log files" track actions occurring on websites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed. </li>
                                <li>"web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior. </li>
                                <li>"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are mostly used to record what pages and ads you have already viewed. Cookies are used to facilitate website navigation (for example, so your bank knows that you logged in), make sure that you are forwarded to the appropriate website when you click on an ad, and generally improve your web browsing experience. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also use cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. You can learn more about cookies on the Internet Advertising Bureau's website  <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/what-information-in-cookie.html" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/what-information-in-cookie.html</a>.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>We use the information we collect for marketing and advertising purposes, to determine which ads perform well, to better match ads and website content to your interests, to assist us in improving the operation of our services, to maintain the quality of our services, to enhance our services to our business partners and clients, to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Undertone's services, and for the other purposes described below. </p>
                           <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                           <p>
                                We do not collect data that includes a name, address, telephone number, email address, government-issued identification, or data that likewise would identify a specific individual ("Personal Identifiable Information" or "PII"), except: </p>

                           <p>Undertone may use and share your information: (1) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients and customers; (2) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (3) to enforce our terms of use or to protect our rights; (4) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of our services; (5) with other Undertone Entities and third party marketing partners; (6) with third party research companies, vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and selected partners for data validation, aggregation, enhancement, verification and suppression purposes, and for research, marketing, advertising, and data aggregation purposes; (7) for the purposes described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy; or (8) for any other purpose for which you provide consent. We also may share information with advertisers, publishers and other third parties for marketing and advertising purposes, but such information does not include PII except if you provided it as part of the Customer Form Ad Business described above. While Undertone strongly encourages its advertising customers, service providers, partners, and members of the Undertone Site Network to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Undertone is not responsible for the information practices of any of third party entities referenced in this paragraph, which may use the information we share with them for the same purposes as we use the information, or for their own independent purposes. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. </p>

                                In the event that Undertone is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or used. </p>

                           <p>Please be aware that the Sites of our advertiser clients as well as the Sites on which we place advertisements or any Site linked to from one of our websites also may collect information from you. Such information may include non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such website. Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, Undertone is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such websites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.</p>

                                Data Retention</h2>
                           <p>Your Internet browser stores OBA-related data as cookies. If you have cookies disabled, if you delete your cookies, or if other software deletes the cookies used for that data storage, such data is lost because it is not retained separately by Undertone. The cookies that store data related to Undertone's OBA will in any case expire one year after the last time such information is stored, barring any technical malfunction.</p>
                           <p> Undertone retains information regarding ad delivery (see, "Ad Delivery &amp; Reporting" above) for up to six (6) months. However, Undertone may retain aggregate statistics, reports and summaries regarding ad delivery for a longer period.</p>
                           <p> Undertone may delete any or all of OBA or information regarding ad delivery that relates to you at any time and in Undertone's sole discretion, notwithstanding its normal data retention policies. Further, Undertone reserves the right to retain and use any information described in this Privacy Policy as reasonably necessary to comply with laws or regulations, notwithstanding any limitations described in this Privacy Policy to the contrary. If Undertone changes its retention data policies by updating this Privacy Policy, its new policies will apply to all data then retained by Undertone.</p>

                           <p>If you would like to opt out of OBA, then we offer "opt-out cookies" to block the tracking and placement of future Undertone cookies for OBA purposes on your system for five (5) years. We may increase this period, which means your opt-out choice will continue for a longer period. If you have multiple Internet browsers or users on the same computer, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser and/or user. If you or your anti-virus or other software deletes the opt-out cookies from your computer, if you re-install your browser, or if you delete your cookies (which can happen if you clear or delete your browser history), then you will need to repeat the process. The opt-out cookies will not work while you have set your browser to ignore cookies. <a href="/privacy/opt-out-status.php">Click Here to Install the Undertone Opt-Out Cookie</a>.

                                Undertone transitioned away from a third-party ad service company in July 2009. If you opted out of targeted advertising between August 2008 and June 2009, you should opt-out again to ensure that your choice is saved and recognized by our ad server. <a href="/privacy/opt-out-status.php">Click Here to Install the Undertone Opt-Out Cookie</a>.

We cannot promise and do not guarantee that our computer systems or those of our vendors will always function properly to exclude you from OBA even thought we work towards that result. To ensure your choice, you may want to revisit the opt-out page and refresh your selection from time to time.</p>
