<p><a name="California Online Privacy Protection Act"></a></p>
<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</span></p>
<p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can visit our site anonymously. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n our Privacy Policy Page.

Where this is the case, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws. &nbsp;EU standard contractual clauses are in place between Underwear Expert and entities that share and process personal data. Where our third party service providers process personal data outside the EEA in the course of providing services to us, our written agreement with them will include appropriate measures, usually standard contractual clauses.</span></p>

<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act). </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</span></p>
