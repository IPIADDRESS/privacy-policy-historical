<h2>SECURITY AND REGISTRATION POLICIES</h2>

<p>We go to great lengths to protect your personal information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology to ensure that all of your personal and transactional information is protected to the highest standards over the Internet.<br>
<br>
When the letters "http" in the URL change to "https," the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL. Your browser may also produce a pop-up message stating that you are about to enter or leave a secure area. Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded or encrypted when it is sent over the Internet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure. Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through our website.</p>
We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us. By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you <u>expressly consent</u> to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach. If you believe that your account or any information you provided to us in no longer secure, please notify us immediately by using the email address or calling the phone number given in the <strong><a href="#section19">How to Contact Us</a></strong> section below<strong>.</strong></div>

<div id="section2">
<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES UNDER ARMOUR GATHER?</h2>

<p><strong>Information You Submit To Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you submit to us via our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

<p>If you choose to register an account with us, we will collect, store and use information such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, and contact details. <a href="http://www.underarmour.co.uk">www.underarmour.co.uk</a> then keeps a record of this information. Additionally, you may have the option of providing information such as your gender, birth date, sports interests, shipping/billing address, daytime phone number, size and other information.</p>

<p>If you place an order with us, we will collect, store and use your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information, email address and phone number. <a href="http://www.underarmour.co.uk">www.underarmour.co.uk</a> then keeps a record of this information. For more information about how credit and debit card details are stored and used by <a href="http://www.underarmour.co.uk">www.underarmour.co.uk</a>, please see “<strong><u>Security and Registration Policies</u></strong>”.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> When you visit our website, we receive and store certain types of information through automatic data collection tools, including cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and other commonly used information gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, IP-address, user-agent string and click stream behavior (i.e., the pages you view; the links you click; and other actions you take in connection with our website). Please see our <strong><a href="http://www.underarmour.com.au/on/demandware.store/Sites-BRANDSITE-Site/en_AU/Page-Show?cid=cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a></strong> for more information about our use of cookies and pixel tags.</p>

<p><strong>Information From Other Sources:</strong> If you have registered an account with us or placed an order through our website, to help us customize shopping for you, improve our communication with you, and improve our business overall, we may obtain certain demographic information about you from reputable third party sources. For example, in the event we determine that you live in a geographical area where the climate is usually cold and you have subscribed to receive email communications from us, we would be more likely to send you communications highlighting our ColdGear® product line rather than our HotGear® product line.</p>
<strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> Under Armour does not and will not register sensitive personal data concerning a person’s religion or philosophy of life, race, political persuasion, health and sexual life, or personal data concerning trade union membership.</div>
