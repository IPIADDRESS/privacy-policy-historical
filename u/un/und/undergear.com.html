												<p><strong> Where you go and what you do – What we know without you telling us ! </strong>
													<br>
													Data about your activity while here on this site is automatically provided to 
													Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> when you sign on. For each visitor, our Web server automatically 
													recognizes only your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We collect only 
													the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Web pages; we 
													collect aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, how many 
													visits we get, and information such as where visitors arrived from as far as 
													other sites on the Internet or if they directly typed our website address into 
													their browser. It is used by us for internal review in aggregate and 
													non-personally-identifiable form.<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Cookies – How we know what we know without you telling us ! </strong>
													<br>
													When you come to Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> or when you register with Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> we 
													create your personal profile, assign a personal identification number, then 
													send this personal identification number back to your computer's hard drive in 
													the form of a "cookie," which is a very small bit of code. A 
													"cookie" is very small text file placed on your hard drive by a Web 
													Page server. It serves as your personal identification card, and cannot be 
													executed as code or deliver viruses. The use of cookies is an industry 
													standard; you will find them at most major Web sites. Cookies make Web-surfing 
													easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never 
													save passwords or credit card information in cookies.</p>
												<p>
													Cookies enable us to know more about your use of the site, and allow you to 
													utilize some of our website's functionality, and correspond with us about your 
													personal profile without having to fill out registration forms with information 
													you've already provided. We use cookies to record session information, such as 
													items that you added to your shopping cart and to conduct marketing tests on 
													our Web pages. By showing how and when you use the site, cookies help us see 
													which areas and products are popular and which are not. Many improvements and 
													updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and 
													pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the 
													information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our visitors' 
													needs.</p>
												<p>The purpose of a "cookie" is to tell the server that you returned to 
													that Web page. Of course, if you never register or leave personal information 
													with Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> then the server only knows that someone with your cookie 
													has returned to the Web site. You are in charge of deciding whether we know 
													anything about you. But the more you tell us about yourself, the more we can 
													help you find information or products you want.</p>
												<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser 
													to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note 
													that some parts of the Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> website and its functionality and links 
													will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. 
													For example, without cookies, you may have difficulty completing shopping 
													transactions, entering giveaways, or creating your personal profile. You can 
													order your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is 
													offered. Then you can decide whether to accept one or not. If you want to control which cookies your computer accepts, <a href="http://www.Undergear.com/aboutourwebsite.asp?navtheme=cserv&amp;click=aw&amp;cm_re=hp-_-nav2.1d6-_-custsvcaboutsite#website_cookies"><b>click here</b></a> and just follow the instructions for your particular Internet browser system.</p>
												<p><strong> Your E-mail address – Do We Know It ? </strong>
													<br>
													Your E-mail address and other personally identifying data about you is known to 
													Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> only when you voluntarily submit it to Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> We collect 
													your e-mail address only if you post a message to us, if you communicate with 
													us via e-mail, if you ask us to communicate with you by e-mail such as for a 
													confirmation of your order or shipment advice, or if you volunteer it for any 
													reason, such as survey information and/or site registration, or sign-up for a 
													Newsletter, and if you started but did not complete an order.</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Your E-mail address – What Do We Do With It ? </strong>
													<br>
													If you begin to place an order from this website, and if you have at anytime 
													given us your e-mail address, we will use your e-mail address not only to 
													communicate with you about the status of your order but also to send you our 
													own e-mails regarding special sales, exclusive offers, and other valuable 
													promotions that we think will interest you.</p>
												<p>
													Like many other online merchants, we participate in cooperative database 
													services which assist us in the matching of offline and online purchasing 
													behavior, and marketing analysis, so that participants can better analyze and 
													understand the differences and tendencies of print catalog purchasers and 
													website visitors, and so that we can maximize the benefit of postal mail and 
													e-mail we send to you. This sharing of information allows us and other 
													interested parties to make future marketing efforts more efficient. These 
													cooperative database services and their participants, however, have no right to 
													use your e-mail address to send you e-mail. At any time, the only person who 
													will e-mail you is us.</p>
												<p>If you would prefer not to receive emails from us regarding special sales and 
													exclusive offers, <a href="https://www.undergear.com/editaccount.asp?opt=1&amp;fromprivacy=1#privacyoptions"><b>click here</b></a>.</p>
												<p><b>Personal Information Other Than Your E-mail Address</b><br>
													<strong>Your California Privacy Rights </strong>Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> has a policy of 
													not disclosing the personal information of our customers to third parties for 
													their own direct marketing purposes if our customers have exercised their 
													option to prevent that information from being disclosed to third parties for 
													such purposes.</p>
												<p>The following paragraphs explain what we do with your personal information and 
													how you can prevent it, or simply <strong><a href="https://www.undergear.com/editaccount.asp?opt=1&amp;fromprivacy=1#privacyoptions"><b>click here to change 
															your privacy preferences</b></a></strong>.</p>
												<p>
													We use your shipping and payment address, and the address you give to us when 
													you "register" your profile with us, to send you our print catalog 
													and catalogs of our participating third-party merchants and affiliated 
													companies which we feel will be of interest to you, all by postal mail.</p>
												<p>
													If you have given us your telephone number, when registering your profile with 
													us or when ordering merchandise from us, we may use your telephone number to 
													reach out to you to follow up on your order of merchandise, including follow-up 
													marketing. We do not share your telephone number with any outside parties for 
													any purpose whatsoever.</p>
												<p>
													We indefinitely maintain all of the information you give to us to help serve 
													you better and to understand our customers and their purchasing patterns over 
													time. Any payment information that is maintained by us is masked to keep it 
													protected in the unlikely event of unauthorized breaches of security.</p>
												<p>We share your name, address and purchase information <em>directly </em>with 
													select merchants who are marketing affiliates of ours. We use this information 
													to match against our own offline catalog information (available from our 
													records and other sources, such as demographic information and past purchase 
													history) and we allow our marketing affiliates to use this information to match 
													against their own offline information (available from their records and other 
													sources, such as demographic information and past purchase history). This 
													sharing of information allows us and other interested parties to make future 
													marketing efforts more efficient. It may be used by our select marketing 
													affiliates to send you offers of interest, by regular postal mail. If at any 
													time we are required to share your full credit card information with marketing 
													affiliates so they can bill you for a product or service, you will be made 
													aware at the time of offer that the product or service is being provided 
													directly by that vendor and we will clearly ask for your consent to make that 
													transfer of your credit card information through secure transmission.</p>
												<p>Like many other online merchants, we participate in cooperative database 
													services which assist us in the matching of offline and online purchasing 
													behavior so that participants can better analyze and understand the differences 
													and tendencies of print catalog purchasers and website visitors and we can 
													maximize the benefit of postal mail and e-mail we send to you if you have 
													signed up with us to receive postal mail or e-mail. It may be used by other 
													cooperative database participants to send you offers of interest, by postal 
													mail.</p>
												<p>Lastly, we do not currently rent e-mail addresses to outside parties or allow 
													any outside parties to use them for e-mailing purposes.</p>
												<p>If you prefer that we do not include you in lists of information we share with 
													others, <a href="https://www.undergear.com/editaccount.asp?opt=1&amp;fromprivacy=1#privacyoptions"><b>click here</b></a>.</p>

													<strong>Opt-Out of Future Catalogs</strong><br>

													we will send you one of our catalogs If for any reason you no longer wish to

													You can always edit or correct any personal information you give Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> 
													by writing to us at: <a href="mailto:custserv@undergear.com"><b>custserv@undergear.com</b></a>.</p>
												<p><strong>Shopping Analysis Provided by Third Party</strong><br>
													Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> uses a number of third party data gathering and analysis 
													services, which aggregate information into broad categories to help us provide 
													you better products, services, and improved websites. We refer to them here as 
													our "Data Compilers". Our Data Compilers are contractually bound to 
													keep our visitors' and customers' data absolutely secure and confidential, and 
													only to analyze the information they have access to by the software we license 
													from them and return it back to Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup>. They have no rights to use this 
													information for any purpose, match it against any other information in their 
													possession, nor transfer or disclose this information to anyone other than to 
													Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup>.</p>
												<p><strong>Customer Privacy During Tracking By Our Data Compilers</strong><br>
													Our Data Compilers have adopted privacy guidelines set by the Federal Trade 
													Commission. Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> relies on our Data Compilers and encourages you to 
													learn more about our each of their Privacy Standards and any available opt-out 
													choices by <a href="http://www.coremetrics.com/privacy.html" target="_blank"><b>clicking here(Coremetrics)</b></a>,

													<strong>Access by The Operator of Our Affiliates Program </strong>
													<br>
													As a visitor to the Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> site, you may have arrived here through a 
													link on one of our affiliate sites. Our affiliates operate websites which they 
													use to conduct a business or generate revenues, and Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> compensates 
													its affiliates based upon any purchases made by an affiliate-linked visitor to 
													the Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> site. The operator of our affiliates program, Commission 
													Junction, in providing its services to us, does not deal directly with our 
													customers. A visitor who clicks on a Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> link located on an 
													affiliate's website is redirected, invisibly, through the website of Commission 
													Junction, where its technology automatically records the IP "address" 
													of the browser used by the visitor, but that address does not permit 
													identification of the individual using the browser. In addition, during such 
													redirection, Commission Junction may place a "cookie" on the hard 
													drive of the visitor's computer through his or her Web browser (See description 
													of cookies above). Commission Junction does not have access to data that 
													identifies or permits the identification of any of Undergear' customers or 
													visitors. The operator of our affiliates program encourages you to learn more 
													about its privacy standards by clicking here.<br>

												<p><strong>Access by Third Party Advertising Companies </strong>
													<br>
													From time to time, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on 
													our behalf across the Internet. In the course of serving advertisements to this 
													and other sites, these companies collect information about your visits to our 
													Web site, and your interaction with our ads. Any information that these third 
													parties collect is completely anonymous, is in a non-personal aggregate format, 
													and is shared for purposes of analysis and improvement of our site. For 
													instance, they may keep track of how many of our ads you had seen before 
													visiting our site. This is primarily accomplished through technology, including 
													cookies and action tags (commonly referred to as Web Beacons or GIF tags), 
													which we will place on various pages within our Web site. These third party 
													advertising companies may, in turn, use information about your visits to this 
													and other Web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of 
													interest to you. If you would like more information about the practices of our 
													third party advertising contractors, if any, and to know how to contact them to 
													advise them of your choices about not having your information used further, 
													please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank"><strong>click here </strong></a>
													.</p>
												<p>
													<strong>Access By Other Corporate Entities </strong>
													<br>
													We share much of our data, including personally identifiable information about 
													you, with our parent company Hanover Direct, Inc., and its subsidiaries and 
													affiliated catalog and e-commerce companies. To the extent that you are not 
													already a customer of such entity, they will do nothing with the information 
													and will treat it at least as protectively as we treat the information we have 
													about you. If you are already a customer of such entity, they may use this 
													information to serve your needs better with respect to their merchandising, 
													promotion, and marketing. If you are a customer of another Hanover Direct 
													catalog company and prefer that we do not include you in lists of information 
													we share with one of our affiliated marketing companies which they may use for 
													promotion or marketing, please <nobr><a href="https://www.undergear.com/editaccount.asp?opt=1&amp;privacyauth=1#PrivacyOpt"><b>click here</b></a>.</nobr></p>
												<p>It is possible that Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> Hanover Direct, or its affiliated companies, 
													or any combination, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. 
													Should such a combination occur, you should expect that Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> would 
													share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide this 
													Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> shopping experience. You will receive notice of such event (to 
													the extent it occurs) as provided in the paragraph below entitled 'Notice', and 
													we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in 
													this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information.</p>
												<p><strong>Problems </strong>
													<br>
													If at any time you have a question or dispute concerning your visit here, your 
													order transaction, or our compliance with this privacy policy, you may contact 
													us at <a href="mailto:custserv@undergear.com"><b>custserv@undergear.com</b></a>. 
													Please provide your first and last name, order number, if any, and, if you have 
													a question about our merchandise, item number(s), and we will get back to you 
													promptly. If we are unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction, you 
													may elect to proceed to submit your complaint to an independent arbitrator to 
													obtain an impartial assessment of your case, in writing. Any such arbitration 
													will be deemed 'conditionally binding', meaning that the decision of the 
													arbitrator will be binding upon Undergear<sup><b>®</b></sup> if you elect to accept the 
													decision, and it will be binding upon you as well. If your dispute concerns our 
													compliance with this privacy policy, and if we are unable to resolve your 
													complaint to your satisfaction, you may elect to proceed with BBBOnLine's
