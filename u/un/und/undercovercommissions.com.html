At all times if you find that you wish to stop receiving communication from us, 
simply click on UNSUBSCRIBE at the bottom of any newsletter that you are a part 
of. Understand that from time to time you may end up subscribing to several 
different specialized newsletters that we offer, so you may still continue to 
receive messages from us, just through a different newsletter. If you are having 
issues unsubscribing simply send an e-mail to 
	mattbacak@gmail.com and we will 
assist you. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
