<h2>YOUR PRIVACY &amp; SECURITY</h2>
<p>Welcome! This Statement of Privacy and Security (“Statement”) governs the websites and online services for ultimateears.com and MakeMusicSocial.com (“Site” or “Sites”) which are owned and operated by Logitech Europe S.A. (collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” “ours”). Please take the time to review this page and contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@logitech.com">privacy@logitech.com</a> with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION<br> HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<br> CONTROL &amp; REVIEW OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br> PROTECTION OF INFORMATION<br> CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT</p>
<h3>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
<h4>Submission of Personal Information</h4>
<p>You may register at our Site and provide personal information, at such times as when you download software, register new products, access product information, features or programs, or sign into a page that requires authorization. This may include your name, email address, physical address, etc. You may also provide demographic information such as your age, education level, household income, and whether you are a personal or business user. You will know what you submit in each case, because you will manually enter the information. If you choose not to register and provide this information, you can still use most of the Site. Unfortunately, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>
<h4>Children's Personal Information</h4>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have such personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.</p>
<h4>Automatic Collection of Information</h4>
<p>We automatically collect on our server logs certain information about your computer hardware and software when you visit our Site. This information may include such things as your IP address, operating system, a description of any products connected and how such products are used, browser type, domain names, access times, service provider and referring website addresses.</p>
<p>We and our third party service providers collect non-personal information about how you use our Site through cookies, Internet tags in the aggregate, and track navigational data. We also collect information such as the URL of the website you previously visited, the pages you visit within our Site and any transaction details (downloads, requests, etc.). You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of our Site might not work.</p>
<h4>Cookies and Tracking</h4>
<p>We may work with online advertising companies to show you relevant, useful or targeted ads (“Online Behavioral Advertising” or “OBA”) based upon your interests. This may include ads served on our Sites or apps. This may also include our ads served on other companies' websites. These ads may be based on non-personally identifiable information collected by us or third parties (for example, when you register for a site) through the use of cookies. These ads may also be based on your activities on our Sites or on third party websites. If you wish to not have this information used for the purposes of servicing you target ads, you may opt-out by disabling cookies placed in your web browser. You will need to check your browser settings to find out how to disable cookies. In addition, we allow you to opt out of browser-enabled interest based advertising by clicking on the Ad Choices icon located on the banner ad.&nbsp; You will be directed to a web page in which you can click the opt out box and we will no longer track your third party website browsing.</p>
<h4>Social Media Features</h4>
<p>Our Site includes social network sign-in services, the Facebook Like button, and widgets, including the Share button (collectively “Features”). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site, and they allow you the ability to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page to share with others within your network. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<h4>Purchase of Products</h4>

<p>If you submit personal information to any third party websites linked to or from our Site, your information is governed by their privacy statement. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.</p>
<h4>Use of non-Personal Information</h4>
