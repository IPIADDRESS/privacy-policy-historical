(“Ultimate Software”) respects the privacy of our customers, employees, Web site visitors, and job applicants.  We believe it is important for you to understand the type of information we collect about you and how that information is used. We recognize the need for appropriate safeguards and management of Personal Information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles Ultimate Software follows with respect to your Personal Information.<br><br><b>Safe Harbor</b><br><br>Ultimate Software adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection on the transfer of Personal Information from European Union member countries to the United States (the “Safe Harbor Agreement”). The Safer Harbor privacy principles are notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, and enforcement.<br>More information about the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor program can be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>. <br><br><b>Scope</b><br><br>This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information received by Ultimate Software (including its Subsidiaries) in any format including electronic, paper, or verbal.<br><br>For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” means any information collected by Ultimate Software that identifies or could be used by Ultimate Software to identify an individual. <br><br><b>Notice</b><br><br><u><i>How Personal Information is Collected</i></u><br><br><u>Web Visitors</u><br>Ultimate Software collects Personal Information about a visitor to our Web site only when the visitor chooses to provide such information.  On certain pages, for example, a visitor has the opportunity to provide his/her personal information such as his/her name, company, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  By supplying such information to Ultimate Software, a visitor can request details about Ultimate Software, including information about the company’s product line and investor information, or sign up for company-sponsored events or use the company’s support Web site.<br><br><u>Web Site / Cookies</u><br>In order to improve the content and format of our site, Ultimate Software uses Web site  tracking software to automatically capture technical information that is then stored in our server’s log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet browser being used, which of our Web pages is visited, and the amount of time spent on our site.<br><br>In addition, some of Ultimate Software’s Web pages may contain "cookies."  A cookie is a small amount of data which our Web site stores on your computer, and which we can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a site other than ours. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes; for example, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information. No cookie will contain information that will allow anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. You can monitor our use of cookies on your computer by setting your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or you can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if you disable the use of cookies on your computer, you may be unable to access certain portions or services on our Web sites.<br><br><u>Job Applicants and Employees</u><br>Ultimate Software collects Personal Information from its employees and job applicants for, among other things, legitimate human resource business reasons such as payroll administration, filling employment positions, maintaining accurate benefits records, meeting governmental reporting requirements, security, health and safety management, performance management, company network access, and authentication.<br><br><u>Customers</u><br>Ultimate Software collects Personal Information from our customers who use our software products.  The information may be collected through our Intersourcing hosted services, or by members of our support team who provide support to licensed customers. The type of Personal Information collected is similar to the information collected under the “Job Applicants and Employees” paragraph, above.<br><br><b>Choice</b><br><br><u><i>Use of Your Personal Information</i></u><br>We use your Personal Information to provide you with the services which Ultimate Software is contractually obligated to provide to you, or to assist you in completing a transaction, or communicate with you about our products or services. We use Personal Information from Web site visitors to respond to any inquiries such visitors make to our Web site and to provide you with related information of interest to you.  We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties.<br> <br>We may disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions). <br><br>Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will endeavor not to release your Personal Information to unknown or unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference your Personal Information with that of any other customer or entity.<br><br><b>Onward Transfer</b><br><br><i><u>Sharing of Your Personal Information</u></i><br>Ultimate Software may contract with third-party providers to perform certain functions on our behalf or to enhance our existing product and service offerings. Examples include providing marketing assistance, product, and service support. <br><br>These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs, however, they are bound by confidentiality agreements before any information is provided to them, and they are restricted from using the information for other purposes.<br><br><b>Links to Non-Ultimate Software Web Sites and Third Parties</b><br><br>Ultimate Software’s Web sites may contain links to third-party sites for your convenience and/or information.
