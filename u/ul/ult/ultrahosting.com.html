        <p>By accessing UltraHosting’s website, you consent to our   collection, use, and disclosure of the information you   provide.</p>
        <p>This privacy statement deals only with personal information   collected through UltraHosting’s website.&nbsp; Any   changes to this statement will be incorporated into a revised statement posted   here, so that you will always have access to information on our current website   information-handling practices.&nbsp; To learn   about UltraHosting’s information-handling practices or privacy practices beyond the Web,   please email your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@UltraHosting.com">privacy@UltraHosting.com</a>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><u>Information   Collection and Use</u></p>
        <p>If you request information, products or services,   enter a contest or other promotional feature, or respond to a questionnaire or   survey, you may be asked for personal information.&nbsp; We value your privacy and will keep such   information secure.&nbsp; However at all times   we reserve the right to disclose information where required by law; to comply   with valid legal processes such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order; to   protect UltraHosting’s rights and property; or during emergencies when safety is at   risk.</p>
        <p>UltraHosting may decide to use your account information and   transaction history to generate statistics and reports for internal use as well   as to offer you products and services by telephone, regular mail, or email.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>If you wish, you can ask that your personal   information not be used for marketing and promotional purposes.&nbsp; This can be done online when you initially   provide the information, or later by contacting   us.</p>
        <p>Information That Does Not Identify You</p>
        <p>UltraHosting may share non-personal or summary information   regarding our customers that does not identify you with advertisers, partners or   other third parties.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>UltraHosting logs certain technical information from your   computer’s web browser when you visit us on the Internet.&nbsp; This information includes your Internet   address, the address of the website you are coming from, the amount of time you   spend visiting our website, the pages visited, the operating system and web   browser software you use, and, if you link to us through a search engine, the   keywords you use to find our website.&nbsp;   The logs do not record personal information, can be accessed only by UltraHosting,   and are used solely to track visits to our site and improve its content and   layout.&nbsp; UltraHosting never attempts to tie this   information to particular individuals visiting our website, unless that is   necessary for investigating a security   breach.</p>
        <p>When you visit our website, you are assigned a   temporary text file called a cookie through your web browser.&nbsp; It is placed on your computer for programming   purposes only and enhances your use of the site by providing a unique identifier   as you move from page to page.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you   use the search engine, it remembers the keywords you enter.&nbsp; The cookie is never redirected to servers   outside UltraHosting.</p>
        <p>Disclosure and Retention of Your Information</p>
        <p>The personal information you provide through our site   is never disclosed to third parties without your consent.&nbsp; We do not sell or trade your personal   information to other organizations or companies, and it is shared with others   only in the ways explained to you at the time it is   disclosed.</p>
        <p>The account information you provide is stored in our   secure databases as long as you are an UltraHosting customer.&nbsp; You must contact us if you no longer want   your information to be kept by us.&nbsp; If   you contact us with a question or comment, any information identifying you is   normally kept only long enough for us to provide a response.&nbsp; If circumstances require us to keep it longer   than that, we will notify you.</p>
        <p><strong>Accuracy of Your   Information</strong></p>
        <p>UltraHosting relies exclusively on you for its information   about you, except for obtaining independent verification of credit card   information.&nbsp; To ensure that you are kept   up-to-date on the products and services we offer, and that there is no   interruption in our communications with you, please contact us to advise us of   any changes in your information or if you wish to confirm the accuracy of the   information we hold.</p>
        <p>How Your Information Is Kept Safe during   Transmission</p>
        <p>UltraHosting strives to provide a secure online environment for   the transmission of personal information such as credit card details, usernames,   and passwords.&nbsp; Information sent to our   website is received by a secure server that encrypts the information before it   is sent to us.&nbsp; All data collected is   protected against unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>Contacting UltraHosting</p>
        <p>UltraHosting accepts responsibility for the management and   confidentiality of the personal information it collects through its   website.&nbsp; By providing this privacy   statement, UltraHosting pledges its continued commitment to protecting the information   you give us.&nbsp; We regularly review our   online information-handling practices to ensure that we are abiding by this   privacy statement.&nbsp; If you believe that   UltraHosting is not abiding by this privacy statement or have concerns about UltraHosting's online   information-handling practices, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@UltraHosting.com">privacy@UltraHosting.com</a>.

        <p><strong><u>ULTRAHOSTING PRIVACY   STATEMENT</u></strong></p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>Your   Privacy and UltraHosting</strong></p>
        <p>UltraHosting is committed to   upholding the confidentiality and security of personal information.&nbsp; We respect   the right to privacy and have instituted practices that will help ensure that   personal information is handled responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this privacy   statement, we describe how we protect the personal information of our customers,   vendors and other third parties whose personal information may come under our   control.&nbsp; Our on-line privacy practices regarding personal information in   relation to UltraHosting websites are described in our UltraHosting Website Privacy Statement.&nbsp;   Our commitment regarding the personal information of our employees is found in   the UltraHosting Employee Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Personal   Information</strong></p>
        <p>We use the term   “personal information” to describe most types of information that can be linked   to an identifiable individual.&nbsp; Examples include an individual’s name, home   address and telephone number, and social insurance number.&nbsp; Information on a   business card (such as job title, business address, business telephone and fax   numbers, and e-mail address) is not typically considered personal information.&nbsp;   However, in cases where our records include both personal and business contact   information and we are unable to separate them, we will handle such records as   personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>The Ten   Privacy Principles</strong></p>
        <p>UltraHosting may need to   collect, use, retain, and disclose personal information to provide services to   our customers and deal with vendors and other third parties.&nbsp; We will request   from you only the personal information necessary for bona fide business   purposes, and will tell you how we intend to use this information.&nbsp; Where our   systems contain personal information of any third parties we will take all   necessary steps to protect that information. </p>
        <p>To ensure that your   privacy is protected, UltraHosting is committed to honouring the following ten privacy   principles:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Accountability<br>
              </strong>UltraHosting has appointed a Privacy   Officer whose responsibility it is to address your privacy concerns and ensure   UltraHosting’s compliance with the ten privacy principles.&nbsp; Should you have concerns   about how your information is handled, or any questions about our privacy   policy, feel free to contact UltraHosting’s Privacy Officer by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@UltraHosting.com">privacy@UltraHosting.com</a>.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
            <strong>Identifying   Purposes<br>
              </strong>If we intend to use or disclose personal information in   ways other than those described to you at the time of collection, we will ensure   that you are informed.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
            <strong>Consent<br>
              </strong>UltraHosting understands that consent is   required for collecting, using, or disclosing personal information (unless the   law provides otherwise).&nbsp; To enable you to make an informed decision about the   personal information you provide, we will clearly explain to you the reasons for   collecting your personal information.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
           <strong>Limiting   Collection<br>
              </strong>To protect your privacy, UltraHosting will only collect personal   information that is relevant to the purposes you are informed of at the time of   collection.&nbsp; By collecting information limited to these purposes, UltraHosting helps   protect you from unnecessary or accidental uses of personal   information.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
            <strong>Limiting   Use, Disclosure, and Retention<br>
              </strong>Just as UltraHosting takes steps to limit the   types of personal information we collect from you, we carefully regulate how we   handle personal information.&nbsp; We do not use your personal information for   purposes other than those which have been consented to, or as required by law or   court process (for example in a legal investigation).<br>
              <br>
              Should UltraHosting require   the services of third parties to handle your personal information, we will   require them to adhere to privacy procedures that will keep personal information   confidential.&nbsp; These third parties will be given only the information necessary   for performing their information-handling services.<br>
              <br>
              UltraHosting does not sell or   trade personal information for commercial purposes.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              UltraHosting is committed to   retaining personal information on our systems only as long as is necessary for   the purposes for which it was collected or retained.&nbsp; UltraHosting is also committed to   deleting or destroying the records containing that information when they are no   longer required; this will be done in ways that will ensure the continued   privacy of any personal information.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
            <strong>Accuracy<br>
              </strong>UltraHosting is committed to ensuring that that   any records it has content control of containing personal information are   accurate, complete, and up-to-date.&nbsp; Although it is your responsibility to   inform UltraHosting of any relevant changes in your personal information, we will take   steps to ensure that if you are a provider of personal information you are able   to verify the information in your file upon request.<br>
              <br>
           
          </li><li>
            <strong>Safeguards</strong><br>
              UltraHosting uses appropriate safeguards to   protect the privacy of personal information.&nbsp; These safeguards are designed to   prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.&nbsp; Your   records are accessible only to staff who have been given the authority to access   them and only as is necessary to provide services or otherwise deal with   you.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
            <strong>Openness</strong><br>
              So that you can be confident that UltraHosting   is handling personal information appropriately, UltraHosting will make information about   its policies and practices concerning management of personal information readily   available.<br>
              <br>
           
          </li><li>
            <strong>Individual Access<br>
              </strong>If at any time you have a question about our records   containing personal information, we will do our best to answer it.&nbsp; You have the   right to be told about the kind of personal information UltraHosting maintains for you,   how it is used, and with whom it is shared.&nbsp; You are entitled to challenge the   factual accuracy as well as the completeness and relevance of our records.&nbsp;   Incorrect personal information will be promptly corrected or, if necessary,   deleted.<br>
              <br>
              In special circumstances, UltraHosting may need to refuse or limit an   access request, for example when disclosure of the information will reveal   personal information about another person or interfere with a legal   investigation.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Most inquiries about our records containing your   personal information will be answered at no cost to you.&nbsp; In special   circumstances, however, it may be necessary to charge a fee, for example when a   lot of staff time is required to gather requested information.&nbsp; If a fee is   necessary, you will be told in advance.<br>
              <br>
            
          </li><li>
            
            <strong>Addressing   Comments and Concerns<br>
            </strong>An important measure of UltraHosting’s compliance with   the ten privacy principles is your perception of our practices and procedures.&nbsp;   We welcome and questions or comments about this statement and will respond to   any concerns you may have about its application.&nbsp; Please visit our website at <a href="http://www.UltraHosting.com">www.UltraHosting.com</a> for contact information   and additional privacy information or email UltraHosting’s Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@UltraHosting.com">privacy@UltraHosting.com</a>.
