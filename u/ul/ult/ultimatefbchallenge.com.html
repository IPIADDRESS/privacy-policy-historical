        <p><strong>What is Personally Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
          Personally Identifiable Information refers to any information 
that identifies  or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the 
person to whom such  information pertains, including, but not limited 
to, name, address, phone  number, fax number, email address, financial 
profiles, Social Security number,  and credit card information. 
Personally Identifiable Information does not  include information that 
is collected anonymously (that is, without  identification of the 
individual user) or demographic information not connected  to an 
identified individual.</p>
        <p><strong>What Personally Identifiable Information is  collected?</strong><br>
          We may collect basic user profile information from all of our

        <p><strong>What organizations are collecting the  information?</strong><br>
          In addition to our direct collection of information, our third

and banks) who may  provide such services as credit, insurance, and 
escrow services may collect  this information from our Visitors and
