		<!-- begin content -->  <div class="node">
                    <div class="content"><p>Welcome to the website located at www.ultrawellness.com (the "<u>Website</u>"), developed and operated by UltraWellness, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company ("<u>Sponsor</u>", "<u>we</u>", "<u>our</u>", or "<u>us</u>").  This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how Sponsor collects and uses your personally identifiable information ("<u>PII</u>") and other information in operating the Website.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Website Work?</strong></p>
<p>The Website provides visitors to the Website ("<u>Visitors</u>") and other individuals who are at least eighteen (18) years of age to access an online community including, a store, chat rooms, message boards, blogs, and other informative resources.  Visitors must register with the Website ("<u>Registrants</u>", collectively with Visitors "<u>you</u>" or "<u>your</u>") in order to make use of certain features offered through the Website, as described herein.  By checking the box “Accept" next to the text of the “Terms and Conditions of Use”, each Registrant acknowledges that such Registrant is at least eighteen (18) years of age and has read, agrees with and accepts to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in Sponsor’s terms and conditions of use and Registrant acknowledges the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.  Failure to check the "Accept" box will prevent an individual from becoming a Registrant.  Registrants may publish, display, or otherwise transmit directly or indirectly ("<u>Post</u>") stories, messages, comments, information, images, graphics, photographs and other content (individually or collectively, "<u>Registrant Content</u>") to the Website, subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>By participating in the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your PII by Sponsor as described herein.  Sponsor reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect and process through the Website at any time.  We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes and such changes will take effect immediately once posted.</p>
<p><strong>What type of PII does Sponsor collect from you and how do we use it?</strong></p>
<p>Registrants must provide certain PII to Sponsor in order to have access to certain features on the Website.  Such PII shall include basic biographical information, such as your name, address, and phone number.  We may also ask you for general statistical, non-PII about your interests and lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Sponsor does not review Registrant Content before it is Posted to the Website, and does not collect PII from Registrant Content unless there is a compelling reason to do so.  Unless you provide PII to Sponsor through the Website (e.g., through registration, Registrant Content, or by email), we will not collect any PII from you.</p>
<p>Sponsor may provide your PII to entities who work on behalf of or with us.  These entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website.  For instance, we may transfer information collected at registration, including PII, to service providers and other third parties who assist us in running the Website. Sponsor may also provide your PII to entities from whom you have indicated you wish to receive special offers or information.</p>
<p>Sponsor may also share your PII with third parties for direct marketing and other purposes, and you acknowledge that the handling of your PII by such third parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you would rather us not share your PII with any third parties for direct marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to Sponsor through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting such a request in writing (an "<u>Opt-Out Request</u>") to UltraWellness LLC at 45 Walker Street, Lenox, MA 01240 or by email at optout@ultrawellness.com.</p>
<p>Please note that it may take several weeks for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request, and until we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII as described in this Privacy Policy.  Please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing.</p>
<p>Please note that if we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing purposes or having otherwise transferred or disposed of your PII, Sponsor may not have the ability to control the use of such PII by any third party, and in such an event you agree that Sponsor shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition.  If you are concerned about Sponsor sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should consider not providing your PII to Sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>Under what other circumstances may we release PII?</strong></p>
<p>We may also release your PII if we believe such release is necessary to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), to apply or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property, to protect Registrants and/or Visitors from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PII.</p>
<p><strong>Who will have access to Content that you Post to the Website?</strong></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that any Registrant Content that you Post to the Website will be viewable by all Registrants and Visitors.  In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, you may not use Registrant Content for commercial purposes or in any manner which competes with, or which may compete with, Sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>What other information does Sponsor collect?</strong></p>
<p>We also collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods.  Cookies are small text files that identify your computer.  We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer's operating system and browser, and complete transactions.  An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed.  Tags may be associated with cookie information.  We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information for promotional purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have the ability not to be identified by Sponsor?</strong></p>

If you do not want us to have any of your PII, do not submit any of your PII to us or include any of your PII in any Registrant Content appearing on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>How do we store information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Does Sponsor provide links to other websites?</strong></p>
