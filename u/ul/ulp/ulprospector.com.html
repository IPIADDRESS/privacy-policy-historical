 <p>Marketing and Sharing Data: </p>

 <p>UL exists to make the world a safer place, including putting customers in touch with suppliers of good quality and safe products and services. Originally this was done via a paper directory of UL certified goods and services, now that happens via our websites. An inherent part of that business model is marketing our service and sharing customer data with UL client companies to enable their follow up sales and marketing activity. These activities are viewed as legitimate UL interests. You are agreeing to these data uses when you tick the Terms and Conditions box.</p>

 <p>Types of recipient companies include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Suppliers of UL certified products and services listed on Product iQ</li>

 <li>Suppliers of products and services listed on Prospector, including their distributors that may send product samples or otherwise follow up on products or services the member has expressed an interest in</li>

</ul>
