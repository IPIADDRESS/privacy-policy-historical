<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="width-control">
    <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with our Privacy Policy.
    YOUR USE OF THE SITE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROSPECTER WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY.
</p>

<h4>Information we collect</h4>

<p>
    We may collect the following types of information:
</p>

<ul class=" expanded">
    <li>
        <strong>Information you provide</strong> - When you sign up for UL's PROSPECTOR® materials database and information
        website ("<strong>Site</strong>"), we ask you for certain professional information. The only professionally
        identifiable information that we keep is the information that you provide to us. You may provide the following
        information for each of our services:

        <ul class=" expanded">
            <li>
                <strong>Prospector Database</strong>: When you register to use the Prospector database you must
                provide professional information such as your name, company name, title, e-mail address,
                address, and certain demographic information. Please review Terms of Use for further information
                on use and privacy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cookies</strong> - A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer that is tied to
        information about the user. When you visit the Site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or
        other browsing device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user
        preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially
        set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when
        a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services may not function properly if your cookies are
        disabled. More information about cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Log information</strong> - We also collect data in a form that does not permit direct association
        with any specific individual. When you access the Site via a browser, application or other client our
        servers automatically record certain information. This may include information such as your web request,
        your interaction with a service, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date
        and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
        To the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law,
        we treat these identifiers as professional information. Similarly, to the extent that non-professional
        information is combined with professional information, we treat the combined information as professional
        information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Product Ordering</strong> - We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide
        contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit
        card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.
        If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. Our online order
        center is a secure site to protect your personally identifiable and financial information. To learn
        more about our security, please review the information provided below under the section titled
        "How we protect your professional information".
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>How we use this information</h4>

<ul class=" expanded">
    <li>
        The information we collect allows us to keep you posted on our latest announcements and upcoming events. It
        also helps us to improve our services, content, and communications. If you don't want to be on our mailing list,
        you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
        We also use information we collect to help us develop, deliver, and improve our services, content, and
        communications.
    </li>
    <li>
        We may use your information to send important notices or communications regarding services you have ordered from UL.
        We may also use information we collect for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to
        improve our products, services, and customer communications.
    </li>
    <li>We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-professional information for any purpose.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prospector Database</strong>: The information you provide to UL to use the Prospector database is collected
        and used so that, from time to time, we can send you information on programs and services that we believe
        may be of interest to you. If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by
        updating your preferences. We reserve the right to disclose information about your usage and demographics,
        provided that it will not reveal your professional identity in connection with the disclosure of such information.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>How we protect your professional information</h4>

<p>
    We do not collect professionally identifiable information without your permission. You can choose which, if any, of
    our online resources you wish to participate in.
</p>

<p>
    With respect to the Prospector database, UL only shares professional information with other companies or individuals
    outside of UL in the following limited circumstances:
</p>

<ul class=" expanded">
    <li>
        We provide such information to our affiliated companies, other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of
        processing professional information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such
        information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
        confidentiality and security measures.
    </li>
    <li>
        We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably
        necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,
        (b) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations, (c) detect, prevent,
        or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights,
        property or safety as required or permitted by law.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    UL takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Site,
    their information is protected both online and off-line.
</p>

<p>
    When our member registration and order forms asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers),
    that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on
    a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon in Web browsers address bars becomes locked, as opposed to
    un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing.'
</p>

<p>
    While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to
    protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above,
    is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
    our accounts receivable department or customer service representatives) are granted access to personally identifiable
    information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return,
    they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, all employees are kept
    up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified
    and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information
    is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment,
    within a locked facility.
</p>

<p>
    If users have any questions about the security at our Site, users can send an email to: <a href=" mailto:customer.support@ulprospector.com">customer.support@ULProspector.com</a>
</p>

<h4>Links to Third Party Websites</h4>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to Prospector database services only. We do not exercise control over third party websites,
    nor do links to these websites imply that UL is affiliated with the linked site. These other sites may place their
    own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit professional information from you. We encourage you
    to learn about the privacy policies of those third parties.
</p>

<h4>Accessing your information</h4>

<p>
    For many of our services, we provide mechanisms for you to update your professional information. You may access and
    update your professional information by logging into your Prospector database account. You are responsible for
    updating your professional information.
</p>

<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>
    UL reserves the right to modify, amend, or update, this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason without notice
    to you. Any such modifications, amendments, updates or deletions will be effective immediately upon posting. Your
    continued use of the Site after such posting shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of the changes.
