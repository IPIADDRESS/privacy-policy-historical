                            form. During registration, a user is required to provide 
                            information (such as name, e-mail address and product 
                            serial number). This information is used to provide 
                            the user about the services on our site for which 
                            he/she has expressed interest. It is optional for 
                            the user to give demographic information (such as 
                            gender, address or occupation), but encouraged, so 
                            that we can provide a more tailored experience on 
                            our site. To confirm registrations, we send all new 
                            members and product registrants a welcoming e-mail.</p>

                          <p class="bodytext">At Ulead, we also do everything 
                            in our power to protect user information off-line. 
                            All of our users' information remains confidential 
                            in our offices. Only a selected number of employees 
                            who need the information to perform a specific job 
                            (e.g. a customer service representative) are granted 
                            access to personally identifiable information. These 
                            employees must also use password-protected screen-savers 
                            when they leave their desk. Furthermore, ALL employees 
                            are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. 
                            Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are 
                            added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
                            about the importance we place on privacy and what 
                            they can do to ensure our customers' information is 
                            protected. Finally, the servers on which we store 
                            personally identifiable information are kept in a 
                            secure environment, behind locked doors.</p>

                            the security at our Web site, you can send an e-mail

                            of our users, we present the option to not receive 
                            these types of communications. For more details on

                            (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires

                            remove that user's personal data provided to us. This 
                            is done at the member information page. </p>

                            related to our site at the point where we ask for 
                            the information. For example, our order form has an 
                            'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from 
                            us but don't want any marketing material can keep 
                            their e-mail address off of our lists. </p>
