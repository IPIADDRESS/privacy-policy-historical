		<br>
		<span class="bodytext"> Ulead is the sole owner of the information 
		collected on this Web site. Any information collected from our 
		users will not be sold, shared, or rented to others in ways different 
		from what is disclosed in this statement.</span> </p>
	      <p><span class="headmiddle_red">Ulead Member and Product Registration</span> 
		<span class="bodytext"><br>
		To become a Ulead member or register a product, a user must first 
		successfully complete a registration form with information such 
		as name, e-mail address and product serial number. This data is 
		used to provide information about the services on our site for 
		which the user has expressed an interest. It is optional for the 
		user to give demographic information (such as gender, address 
		or occupation), but encouraged, so that we can provide a more 
		tailored experience on our site. To confirm registration, we send 
		all new members and product registrants a welcoming e-mail.</span> 
	      </p><p class="headmiddle_red">Online Purchases<br>
	      </p><p class="bodytext">We use an outside company, element 5, to ship 
		orders and process credit cards. This company does not retain, 
		share, store or use personally identifiable information for any 
		secondary purposes.<br>
	      </p>
	      <p class="bodytext">On our order form, a user is asked to provide 
		contact information (e.g. name and address) and payment information 
		(e.g. credit card number, expiration date). This information is 
		used for billing purposes, to fill customer's orders and, if the 
		customer chooses, may be used for future promotional offers. If 
		we have trouble processing an order, this contact information 
		will be used to get in touch with the user.
	      </p>
	      <p class="bodytext"><span class="headmiddle_red">Cookies</span> 
		<span class="bodytext"><br>
		A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing 
		information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in NO WAY linked 
		to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 
		Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.</span> 
	      </p><p class="bodytext">Cookies provide a more tailored and convenient 
		experience for users. For instance, by setting a cookie on our 
		site, the user would not have to login more than once, thereby 
		saving time. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the 
		interests of our users to further enhance the experience on our 
		site. Rejecting a cookie will limit users to some areas of our 
		site.<br>
	      </p>
	      <p><span class="headmiddle_red">Log Files</span> <span class="bodytext"><br>
		We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track 
		user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
		aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
		information.</span> 
	      </p><p><span class="headmiddle_red">Sharing</span> <span class="bodytext"><br>
		We will ONLY share aggregated demographic information with our 
		partners and advertisers. This is NOT linked to any personal information 
		that can identify any individual person.</span> 
	      </p><p class="bodytext">As mentioned above, an outside company called 
		Element 5 processes online orders. This company does not retain, 
		share, store or use personally identifiable information for any 
		secondary purposes.</p>
	      <p class="bodytext">Sometimes we partner with another party to provide 
		specific services. When the user signs up for these specific services, 
		we will share ONLY information that is necessary for the third 
		party to provide these specific services. These third parties 
		are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except 
		for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
	      <p><span class="headmiddle_red">Links</span><br>
		<span class="bodytext">This Web site contains links to other sites. 
		Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
		of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
		leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and 
		every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
		This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
		by this Web site.</span> 
	      </p><p><span class="headmiddle_red">Newsletters</span><br>
		<span class="bodytext">If a user wishes to subscribe to our News 
		Flash or Product Updates, we only ask for the user's e-mail address.</span> 
	      </p>
	      <span class="headmiddle_red">Surveys &amp; Contests</span> <span class="bodytext"> 
	      <br>
	      From time-to-time our site will request information from users via 
	      surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests 
	      is completely voluntary, and, therefore, the user has the choice 
	      of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested 
	      may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
	      and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact 
	      information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
	      Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving 
	      the use and satisfaction of this site.</span> 
	      <p><span class="headmiddle_red">Trial Downloads</span> <span class="bodytext"> 
		<br>
		Many Ulead products have trial software available for downloading. 
		During the trial download process, the user has a choice to opt-in 
		or -out of certain options. For example, these may include the 
		option to receive occasional Ulead product news and special offers 
		via e-mail. </span> 
	      </p><p class="bodytext"> After a user downloads a software trial, only 
		two follow-up e-mails will be sent. The first to confirm the trial 
		download and the second to remind the user the end of the trial 
		is nearing. There will be no subsequent mailings related to the 
		download, unless you choose to sign up for them.</p>
	      <span class="headmiddle_red">Security</span> <span class="bodytext"> 
	      <br>
	      This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
	      When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information 
	      is protected both online and off-line.</span> 
	      <p class="bodytext">When our registration/order form asks users 
				to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or 
				social security number), that information is protected with the 
				best encryption software in the industry: Secure Sockets Layer 
				(SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock 
				icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape® Navigator 
				and Microsoft® Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
				to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more 
				about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com/site/ssl.html 
				</a></p>
	      <p class="bodytext">At Ulead, we also do everything in our power 
		to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information 
		remains confidential in our offices. Only a selected number of 
		employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. 
		a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
		identifiable information. These employees must also use password-protected 
		screen-savers when they leave their desk. Furthermore, ALL employees 
		are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Every 
		quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees 
		are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on 
		privacy and what they can do to ensure our customers' information 
		is protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally 
		identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, behind 
		locked doors.</p>
	      <p class="bodytext">If you have any questions about the security 
				at our Web site, you can send an e-mail to <a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('contact_form/privacy.htm','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=517,height=500')">Ulead</a>.</p>
	      <p><span class="headmiddle_red">Special Offers</span> <span class="bodytext"><br>
		Due to their request, established members will occasionally receive 
		information about products, services, special deals, and a News 
		Flash. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we provide 
		the option to discontinue these types of communications. For more 
		details, please see the Choice/Opt-out paragraph below. </span> 
	      </p><p class="bodytext"><span class="subhead">Modifying/Updating Personal 
		Information</span><br>
		If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such 
		as the postal code) or if a user no longer desires our service, 
		we provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal 
		data. This is done at the member information page.</p>
	          <p><span class="headmiddle_red">Choice/Opt-out</span><br>
                <span class="bodytext">Our users are given the opportunity to 
                'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly 
                related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 
                These types of options may include receiving product specific 
                news, 3rd party contact, or even adding your e-mail address to 
                a contest list. </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext">Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional 
                materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by modifing 
                your mailing status <a href="subscribe.htm">here</a>. </span></p>
              <p class="bodytext">Users who no longer wish to receive promotional 
		materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications 
		by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail.</p>
	          
	      <span class="headmiddle_red">Notification of Changes</span> <span class="bodytext"><br>
	      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
	      on our home page so our users are always aware of what information 
	      we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, 
	      we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable 
	      information in a manner different from that stated at the time it 
	      was collected, we would notify users by way of an e-mail. Users 
	      will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information 
	      in this different manner. We will use information in accordance 
	      with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</span>
