        We will tell you what measures we take to secure that information.<br>
        We will tell you what information we share about you with other entities. 
        We will explain what your rights are, and how you can exercise them. If 
        you share an account relationship with someone else, such as a joint accountholder 
        or co-borrower, we suggest that you share this information with such persons 
        to ensure that each of you is aware of our policy and your options.<br>
        <br>
        We define some terms. <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><em><strong>Nonpublic personal information</strong></em> means information 
          about you that we collect in connection with providing a financial product 
          or service to you. Nonpublic personal information does not include information 
          that is available from public sources, such as telephone directories 
          or government records. Hereafter, we will use the term "information" 
          to mean nonpublic personal information as defined in this section.<br>
          An <em><strong>affiliate</strong></em> is a company we own or control, 
          a company that owns or controls us, or a company that is owned or controlled 
          by the same company that owns or controls us. Ownership does not mean 
          complete ownership, but means owning enough to have control, as defined 
          by federal law.<br>
          A <em><strong>nonaffiliated third party</strong></em> is a person we 
          do not employ or a company that is not an affiliate of ours. This is 
          also known as nonaffiliated third party, or simply, an "other party."<br>
          <em><strong>Opt out</strong></em> means a choice you can make to prevent 
          certain sharing of information. We will explain how you can exercise 
          this choice.<br>
