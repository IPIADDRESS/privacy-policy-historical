        Information About Procedures For Opening A New Account—<br>
        To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering 
        activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, 
        verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an 
        account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask 
        for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will 
        allow us to identify you; we may also ask to see your driver’s license 
        or other identifying documents.<br>
