<h1>UberCab.com Privacy Policy <small>(effective September 16, 2010)</small></h1>

<p>Ubercab is committed to protecting our visitors’ and members’ privacy.  The following Privacy Policy outlines the information Uber, Inc., (the "Company", "we", or "us") may collect and how we may use that information to better serve visitors and members.</p>

<p>BY USING OUR WEBSITE AND MOBILE APPLICATION (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SERVICE"), YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. Please review the following carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.</p>

<p>We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Service and/or email notification. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting and/or electronic delivery.</p>

<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@uber.com">support@uber.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Children Under the Age of 13</h2>

<p>The Company cares about the safety of children. Because the Service is not directed toward kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register with or use the Service. If a child under the age of 13 tries to register, they will be "bumped-out" of the registration process after entering their birth date.   In the event that we discover we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, the Company will delete that information as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>Upon registration with the Service, a user profile is developed to further customize the user’s experience.  The current required data fields are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Password</li>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Mobile Number</li>
  <li>Zip Code</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our website (the "Website") or use the Service, including, but not limited to geographic areas.  If you are traveling in a vehicle ordered via the Service, the driver’s mobile phone will record your GPS coordinates.  Most GPS enabled mobile devices can define one’s location to within 50 feet.</p>

<p>To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser.</p>

<p>Users of the Website should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by virtue of the standard operation of the Company’s computer servers or through the use of "cookies". Cookies are files a website can use to recognize repeat users, and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies take up minimal room on your computer and cannot damage your computer’s files. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. Users should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. There may, however, be some features of the Service which require the use of cookies in order to customize the delivery of information to you.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Service .  We use this information to closely monitor which features of the Service are used most and to determine which feautures we need to focus on improving, including usage patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should offer or focus services, features and/or resources.</p>

<p>The Company uses your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer the Website. Your IP address is used to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic data. Your IP address contains no personal information about you.</p>

<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

<p>The Company may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information and log data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.</p>

<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Website-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Website and Service are used. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide personal information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.</p>

<p>The Company cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of the Company or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p>The Company may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The personally identifiable information we collect is securely stored within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk.  We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.</p>
