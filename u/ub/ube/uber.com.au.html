    	      <p> This document is a summary of the way uber manages personal   information it collects on: </p>
    	      <ul>
    	        <li> people who access its website; and </li>
    	        <li> people who contract with the company for the provision of services   ('customer'). </li>
  	        </ul>
    	      <p> The policy is based on the National Privacy Principles that   apply to private businesses under the Privacy Act, 1988 (Commonwealth).   The National Privacy Guidelines can be accessed at <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/business/guidelines/index">www.privacy.gov.au/business/guidelines/index</a>.</p>
    	      <p> In summary, our policy is to: </p>
    	      <ul>
    	        <li> collect only as much personal information on you as we require to   provide you with an effective service and meet our legal obligations; </li>
    	        <li> hold the information in a secure manner; </li>
    	        <li> give you access to the information if you request it and the means   to change it if it is incorrect; and </li>
    	        <li> destroy or de-identify personal information when it is no longer   required. </li>
  	        </ul>
    	      <p> This policy statement may be amended from time to time. Our website   will always display the up-to-date version. </p>
    	      <h2 id="general"> General Disclaimer </h2>
    	      <p> There are inherent risks in transmitting information across the   Internet. We can give no absolute guarantee that all data, including   personal information, provided via the Internet is secure from   unauthorized use. </p>
    	      <p> Personal details you provide via chat rooms and similar forums,   whether sponsored or endorsed by us or by web sites we host, are in the   public domain and as such are not covered by this privacy policy. </p>
    	      <p> uber hosts web sites owned and operated by other people. This   privacy policy does not necessarily extend to any personal information   they might collect in the course of their operations. We cannot be held   responsible for breaches of privacy on their web sites. The owner of   each web site is responsible for the privacy of any personal information   collected through their web site and for complying with relevant   privacy laws. </p>

We will seek your agreement before any   voice recording is made. We also hold copies of any correspondence that   passes between us. </p>
    	      <p> From time to time we may survey our customers to assist us in   planning and delivering better services. The provision of this   information will be voluntary and our intended use will be clearly   identified at the time of collection. </p>
    	      <p> We will not sell or otherwise make available the personal details of   our clients to third parties, other than a limited number of providers   we contract to supply support services to uber in the normal course   of our business. We require such providers to comply with our privacy   policy when dealing with our clients' information and we only provide as   much information as is necessary for them to provide their services to   us. </p>
    	      <h2 id="security"> Security of Personal Information </h2>
    	      <p> We store most of your personal information on servers which are   housed in a secure environment with 24 hour surveillance. Access is   restricted to authorised staff only. We have computer and network   security on our remote peripherals. Billing data is encrypted and access   to your personal data by non staff members is password protected </p>
    	      <p> We will take all reasonable steps to delete or permanently   de-identify personal information we hold on you if you cease to be our   client and we no longer need the information to finalise any outstanding   matters. </p>
    	      <h2 id="disclosure"> Disclosure of Personal Information </h2>
    	      <p> In the normal course of business we will not disclose your personal   information to any other party (other than contracted support services)   without your consent. However, circumstances may arise where we will   disclose your personal information without your consent. The   circumstances include but are not limited to situations where disclosure   is required to: </p>
    	      <ul>
    	        <li> comply with the law or in situations where we have reason to suspect   that you are engaged in unlawful activity or improper conduct and we   disclose your personal information as a necessary part of our   investigation or to report our concerns to the relevant authorities; </li>
