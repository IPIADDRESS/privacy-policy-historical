date it was  revised.&nbsp; We encourage you to review this  Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal  information you provide

<p id="pp1"><strong>Q1.&nbsp; What  is Personal Information?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A1.&nbsp; As used  herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically  identifies any individual (such as a name, address, telephone 

number, mobile  number, e-mail address, or credit card number), or information about that  individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable 

information.&nbsp; Personal information does not include  "aggregate information", which is data we collect about the use of the Services  or about a group or 

category of services or users, from which individual  identities or other personal information has been removed.&nbsp; This Policy in no way restricts or limits 

our  collection and use of aggregate information.&nbsp;  Personal information also does not include a Device Identifier (as  defined below) that is not connected 

to personal information.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp2"><strong>Q2.&nbsp; What  types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our  guests?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A2.&nbsp; We  collect several types of personal information about our guests in a number of  ways when you visit or use the Services:</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us or Active  Collection. </strong></p>
<p>We collect certain information from you when you  voluntarily provide it, such as if you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a <a href="">Ubi.com</a> account; </li>
  <li>Apply for a beta tester position; </li>
  <li>Subscribe to one of our newsletters; </li>
  <li>Email-a-friend; </li>
  <li>Participate in our community forums or chat  rooms; </li>
  <li>Shop at one of our online stores or purchase  virtual items within a Ubisoft's game; </li>
  <li>Receive customer or technical support; </li>
  <li>Participate in contests, events, or promotions; </li>
  <li>Register product online for warranty protection;  and&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Polls, surveys, or questionnaires. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Typically, the personal information collected includes:  Name; email address; telephone number; shipping and billing address; date of  birth, and for 

those purchasing products through the Services. Additionally, we  may also collect demographic information such as your age, gender, country and  zip code of 

residence, recent game purchases, and game ownership and  preferences. This demographic information may be associated with your personal  information.&nbsp; If 

this demographic  information is connected with personal information, we will treat the  demographic information as personal information. Furthermore, 

Ubisoft may  collect information regarding the user's behavior, and his/her use of Ubisoft's  demos and in-game data such as achievements, rankings, time 

played to better  adapt our products and Services to users' interests and for a better quality of  our services</p>
<p>For some features of the Service, you may be able  to submit information about other people.&nbsp;  For instance, if you wish to send a coupon or advertisement 

to a friend  you may submit some of your friend's personal information.&nbsp; Ubisoft will use any such information that we  collect from you about another 

person to carry out your request.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Passive Collection</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Services, some information is also  automatically collected.&nbsp; Ubisoft as well  as any third party advertisers and/or service provides, 

may use a variety of  technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the  Services are accessed and used ("Usage Information").&nbsp; 

For example, when you come to use or visit  the Services, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device  Identifier") for the computer, 

mobile device, technology or other device  (collectively, "Device") you use to access the Services, your operating system,  the browser type, the address of 

the referring web site and your activity on  the Site or your console ID. An Device Identifier&nbsp; is often associated with the portal through  which you enter 

the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your  company, or your university.&nbsp; We also can  use the Device Identifier to determine the general 

physical location of your  Device and understand from what regions on the world the visitors to the  Services come.&nbsp; Standing alone, your  Device Identifier 

is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use Device  Identifiers&nbsp; to collect information  regarding the frequency with which our guests visit 

various parts of our  websites.&nbsp; If we combine this information  with personally identifiable information, we treat this information as personal  

information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
<p>We may also automatically collect certain  information and monitor user activity through the use of "cookies" or web  beacons (also known as web bugs, 

pixel tags, tracking pixels, or clear gif's or  by monitoring a user's Device Identifier) on the Services.&nbsp; If we link cookies to any personally  

identifying information, we will treat this information as personal  information.&nbsp; The web beacons we use do  not collect any personal information.&nbsp; If  you 

wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies on the Site, please refer to  your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.&nbsp; However, if you choose 

to remove or reject  cookies, this could affect certain features on the Services.&nbsp; Information provided by cookies, web beacons,  Device Identifier's or 

other devices may be used, among other things to analyze  data, to determine the popularity of certain content, to deliver advertising  targeted to your 

interests, to make recommendations to you and to better  understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the effectiveness of  Ads.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement  and have left our websites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must  read the privacy policy 

of the advertiser to see how your personal information  will be handled on their website.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Third parties may also use cookies, web beacons, or  other devices to collect information when you use the Services.&nbsp; Ubisoft does not control any cookies 

or other  data collection tools that may be placed on the Services by a third party, and  this Policy does not cover the use of such cookies and/or other 

data collection  tools by any third party.&nbsp; We encourage  you to read the privacy policies of the website and applications you use to  find out more about 

the information that may be collected by third parties and  the choices you have regarding the collection, use and sharing of such  information. </p>
<p><strong>Advertisements</strong></p>
<p>We may partner with third party online advertising  companies to deliver advertisements on our Services.&nbsp; Because your internet browser or mobile  device 

must request these advertising banners from ad networks' servers, these  companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had  

requested a web page from the Service.&nbsp;  Please note that if an advertiser on a third party ad network asks us to  show an advertisement to a certain 

audience (for example, males ages 18-34) or  audience segment (for example, men ages 18-34 who have viewed video game  related items) and you respond to that 

ad, the advertiser or ad-server may  conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to  reach.&nbsp; However, we would only authorize  

third party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and  anonymous targeting.&nbsp; We would not  knowingly permit a third party ad server to 

collect Personal Information about  you.&nbsp; If you want to prevent a third  party ad server and/or third party service provider from sending and reading  

cookies on your computer or mobile device, you must visit each third party ad  server network's website individually and opt out (if they offer this  

capability).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Information Received From Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We also may obtain certain non-personal information  about you from third parties.&nbsp; This  information may include demographic, geographic, psychographic 

and other usage  information that does not personally identify an individual user and may be  associated with anonymous device ID and/or a console 

identification  number.&nbsp; You may also choose to  participate in a third party applications or features (such as one of our  social network applications or a 

similar application or feature on a third  party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third  party to collect and share) 

information about you, including personal  information.&nbsp; If you access the Services  through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your 

user ID  and/or username associated with that third-party service, and any information you  have made public in connection with that service or with the 

third party shares  with partner services.&nbsp; In addition, we  may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give  us access to 

their providers and you are one of their "connections" or  information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections"  webpage, profile page, 

or similar page on a social networking or other third  party website or interactive service.&nbsp;  The collection and use of this information is pursuant to such 

third  party's information collection practices, which are typically outlined in a  privacy policy like this one, provided on the third party's website or 

in an  application.&nbsp; This Policy does not apply  to information received from third parties, and Ubisoft is not responsible for  the privacy and security 

practices and policies of such third parties.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also may supplement the information we collect  about you through the Services with our information from third parties in order  to enhance our ability 

to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer  you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of  interest to you.&nbsp; We 

may combine the  information we receive from these third parties with information we collect  through the Services.&nbsp; In those cases, we  will apply this 

Policy to any personal information received, unless we have  disclosed otherwise.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp3"><strong>Q3.&nbsp; How is your personally identifiable information  used and shared?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A3.&nbsp; We don't  sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your consent.  We don't require personal information to access our 

website. However, if you  prefer not to disclose personal information, you will not be able to enjoy  certain features of our website. </p>
<p>We use personal information we collect through the  Site for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Site.&nbsp; For example, we may use 

personal and other  information we collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To provide the services, products or information  you request and to process and complete any transactions in connection  therewith; </li>
  <li>To request feedback and to otherwise contact you  about your account or your use of the Services.&nbsp;  For instance, if you create a <a href="">Ubi.com</a> and your account is later  cancelled (e.g., due to lack of activity), we may subsequently contact you to  let you know 

that we've reactivated your account for a short period of  time.&nbsp; We may also use your personal  information for other purposes such as "Operational 

Uses." For  example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications  either about your account with us or about features of our 

websites, including  any future changes to this Privacy Policy;</li>
  <li>To communicate with you and respond to your  emails, submissions, questions, inquiries, comments, requests, and complaints  and to provide customer 

service.&nbsp; For  instance, we may use your email address to send you service announcements that  tell you about updates to our Policy, changing in pricing, 

changes to our  online service or customer support policies, and other related service  changes.;</li>
  <li>To personalize and improve the Site and users'  experiences, to increase the functionality and user friendliness of the Site,  to deliver 

advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles or  interests, and to provide recommendations as to other advertisements, content  or features 

that may be of interest to users; </li>
  <li>To monitor and analyze the Site usage and trends  and otherwise measure the effectiveness of the Site;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>To provide you with news and information about  our third party events, activities, offers, promotions, products, and services  we think will be of 

interest to you; </li>
  <li>To send you confirmations, updates, security  alerts, and support and administrative messages, to detect and prevent fraud,  and to otherwise 

facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation  of, the Services;</li>
  <li>To notify you about important changes to our  Services;</li>
  <li>To conduct surveys and to notify and contact  contest and sweepstakes entrants; and </li>
  <li>For any other purpose for which the information  was collected.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not share the personal information we  collect from you through the Services with third parties, except as described  in this Policy or on the 

Site.&nbsp; For  example, we may share personal information as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With vendors, consultants, and other service  providers ("Service Providers") who are engaged by or working with us in  connection with the operation 

of the Site and who need access to such  information to carry out their work for us From time to time, we may share your  personal information with technical 

partners which help Ubisoft with the  operation of the Services, including, without limitation, payment processing,  and products delivery. To the extent 

that our technical partners have access to  your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive  as the practices described in this 

Policy ;</li>
  <li>Upon your request or with your consent, we will  share your information with other users of the Site;</li>
  <li>When you give us your consent to do so,  including if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a  particular manner and you 

provide such information;</li>
  <li>With Advertising Partners to send you coupons,  promotions, rewards, awards and advertisements you request;</li>
  <li>To enforce or apply this Policy, our Terms of  Use, or our other policies or agreements;</li>
  <li>To enter you into a sweepstakes, contest, or  promotion; and</li>
  <li>To respond to your questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>We may take your personally identifiable  information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it  with information about other 

individuals (aggregating your information with  information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as  your name) that make the 

information personally identifiable to you  (de-personalizing your information).&nbsp;  This can include a Device Identifier, usage information and/or  

information that is not connected to personal information.&nbsp; Given the nature of this information, no  restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our 

right to aggregate or  de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and share in any way  with third parties the resulting non-personally 

identifiable information.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Business Information</strong></p>
<p>For practical reasons, we treat personal  information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information  we receive in a non-business 

capacity. Personal information submitted to us in  a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties, depending  on the nature of the 

inquiry. </p>
<p><strong>Purchase or Sale of  Businesses </strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or  sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information  may be transferred as a 

part of the purchase or sale. If we purchase a  business, the personally identifiable information received with that business  would be treated in accordance 

with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable  and permissible to do so. If we sell a business, we will include provisions in  the selling contract 

requiring the purchaser to treat your personally  identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy  (including any amendments to 

this Privacy Policy). The provisions of this  paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
<p><strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to  Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others</strong></p>
<p>We will disclose personal information when we  believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including,  for example, to comply 

with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to:  enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game  rules; protect your 

safety or security, including the safety and security of  property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of our  websites or third 

parties. </p>
<p>You understand that when you use the Services, any  information you post in any interactive areas of the Services, including in any  comments, listings, 

profiles, public or private groups or forums, as well as  any information you share with individuals through public or private groups or  forums, as well as 

any information you share with individuals through the  Services or through social network sites or other social feeds, will be  available to other users and 

in some cases may be publicly available.&nbsp; We recommend you be cautious about giving out  personal information to others or sharing personal information in 

public or  private online forums. </p>
<p>We are not responsible for the actions of third  party service providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any  additional information 

you provide directly to any third parties, and we  encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing  information directly to 

any such parties.&nbsp;  Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized  information, which may be shared with third parties without your 

consent. </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp4"><strong>Q4.&nbsp; What  choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally  identifiable information?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A4.&nbsp; As mentioned  above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us. If at  any time you decide to remove your personal information 

from our database, you  may do so by visiting your profile section or contacting us at  <a href="http://support.ubi.com">support.ubi.com</a> or at <a href="mailto:support@ubisoft.com">support@ubisoft.com</a>. If you contact us by email, please include the name of the website you used to  register and the 

email address you used to register with us so we can verify  your request. </p>
<p><strong><u>Your  California Privacy Rights</u></strong>:&nbsp; The  following applies solely to California residents who have an established  business 

relationship with Ubisoft.&nbsp; If  we collect personal information from you, we may make the personal information  available to third parties for their 

marketing and promotional purposes.&nbsp; If you decide that you do not want us to  share your personal information with these companies for their marketing and  

promotional purposes, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@ubisoft.com">support@ubisoft.com</a>.&nbsp;In this email, state that you would like  

Ubisoft to not share your personal information with third parties for their  marketing purposes.&nbsp; You opt out request  will be processed within thirty (30) 

days of the date of which we receive  it.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp5"><strong>Q5.&nbsp; Do we  collect information for children under the age of 13?</strong></p>
<p>A5.&nbsp; Ubisoft  is very sensitive to privacy issues. We are especially careful in any  communications with children under the age of 13 ("Child" or 

"Children").&nbsp; Ubisoft restricts access to certain Services  on age grounds and, in certain jurisdictions, for certain Services and  functions, asks for 

parent approval when a Child wishes to register for the  Services.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When we intend to collect personal information from  a Child, we take additional steps to protect children's privacy, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Notifying parents about our information  practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information  we may collect from Children, 

the uses to which we may put that information,  and whether and with whom we may share that information </li>
  <li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining  consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their  Children, or for sending 

information about our products and services directly  to their Children </li>
  <li>Limiting our collection of personal information  from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an  online activity </li>
  <li>Giving parents access or the ability to request  access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the  ability to request that 

the personal information be changed or deleted </li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, when a Child under the age of 13  registers, (s)he must supply the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian  who will be contacted 

by Ubisoft to ask him/her to confirm, refuse to modify  his/her Minor's registration. Ubisoft reserves the right to limit the period  during which a child 

under the age of 13 may play pending confirmation and  activation by his/her parent or guardian.&nbsp;  Ubisoft reserves the right to ask for written proof of 

parental consent  for any user or potential user of the services suspected to be a Child.&nbsp; Parental consent applies exclusively to the  specific service for 

which it has been granted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Certain Services are specifically designed for  Children and enable Children under the age of 13 to create their own free  accounts for which Ubisoft 

collects their username, password, date of birth (or  age), country, and parent or guardian's e-mail address.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>Such services sometimes offer the possibility of  paying for a subscription or certain game functions which enable Children to  participate in more 

activies on the Services by making a payment.&nbsp; The subscription services may also allow  parents or guardians to manage their Child's account and create 

their own  player accounts.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<p>Certain services enable Children to create  personalized avatars which they can use in numerous activies in the services,  including mini-games and 

virtual worlds.&nbsp;  Children may also use other functions of the Services such as "Recommend  to a friend" to invite a friend to find out about the servies.&nbsp; 

The "Recommend to a friend" functions enable  Children to send their friends a single message inviting them to visit the  related service.&nbsp; Ubisoft will 

collect  the first name and e-mail address of your Child (or, failing that, the e-mail  address of the parent or guardian) and the e-mail address of his/her 

friend for  the sole purpose of sending a single message.&nbsp;  This information is neither stored nor used for any other purpose and we  do not reveal your 

child's e-mail address to the recipient.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Parents may delete their Child's Account or change  their Child's privacy settings at any time by creating a parental Account or by  sending an e-mail 

to the administrator of the Privacy Policy, who is identified  below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In all cases, use of the Services by Children must  take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any  use of the Services 

is assumed to have been validated by them.&nbsp; AS FAR AS IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE  LEGISLATION, UBISOFT DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES 

WHICH  MAY BE CONDUCTED BY CHILDREN WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THEIR PARENTS OR LEGAL  GUARDIANS.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU GIVE  YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OR OTHER OF THE SERVICES,  YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE 

TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR  CHILD.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp6"><strong>Q6.&nbsp; Does  this privacy policy apply to other websites linked to this Site?</strong></p>
<p>A6.&nbsp; The  services may contain links to other websites.&nbsp;  For instance, purchases of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items for Ubisoft  Services may be 

transacted on a third party processors site.&nbsp; Any personal information you provide on  linked pages or applications is provided directly to that third party 

and is  subject to that third party's privacy policy.&nbsp;  This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we are not  responsible for the content 

or privacy and security practices and policies of  these websites or any other sites that are linked to or from the Services.&nbsp; We encourage you to learn 

about their privacy  and security practices and policies before providing them with personal  information.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp7"><strong>Q7.&nbsp; What  kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable  information?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A7.&nbsp; The  security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely  important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and 

physical  security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access  and improper use. From time to time, we review our security 

procedures to  consider appropriate new technology and methods. However, please understand  that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or 

 impenetrable.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To protect the confidentiality of personal  information maintained in your account, you must keep your password  confidential and not disclose it to any 

other person.&nbsp; You are responsible for all uses of the  Services by any person using your password.&nbsp;  Please advise us immediately if you believe your 

password has been  misused.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;DESPITE OUR  EFFORTS TO KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE, NO COMPANY CAN GUARANTY THE  SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF ITS SERVICES, INFORMATION AND OTHER 

DATA.&nbsp; ACCORDINGLY, UBISOFT DISCLAIMS AND DOES NOT  REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR PRIVACY OR THE  SECURITY OF ITS DATA IN 

REGARD TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.&nbsp; OUR PRIVACY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE "AS  IS" AND UBISOFT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE FITNESS FOR A 

PARTICULAR  PURPOSE OR MERCHANTABILITY.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="#top">BACK TO TOP</a>
</p><p id="pp8"><strong>Q8.&nbsp; How  can you update your personal information and profile?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>A8.&nbsp; You can  access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that  is, your e-mail address or any other information that would 

directly enable us  to contact you), by logging in and clicking the Edit Profile section, or  contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ubisoft.com">privacy@ubisoft.com</a>.&nbsp;In  your email, please include the name of the website you used to register so we  can verify your 

request. </p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails,  texts, or other communications from Ubisoft, please follow one of the two  options below:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must opt-out to receive promotional  e-mails, texts, or other communications.&nbsp;  When providing your personal information, simply uncheck
