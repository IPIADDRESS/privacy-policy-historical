From time to time, we may add new websites and will take reasonable steps to update the list.<br><br>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the websites listed above, and does not apply to information that may be collected by Ubisoft offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy applies only to websites maintained by Ubisoft USA and not to sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link including: (i) www.bluebyte.net and other sites operated by the Blue Byte Game Channel; (ii) our parent company, Ubisoft Entertainment S.A.; and, (iii) our international affiliates (e.g., Ubisoft in Japan, Ubisoft in Canada, Ubisoft in the UK, etc.). Ubisoft is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on such sites.<br><br><i>By using and submitting personal information to any of our websites, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of our websites. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of any of our websites will signify your acceptance of these changes. Please note that the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are incorporated into our general <a zref="">Terms of Use</a>.</i><br><br><a name="2"></a><b>What types of information does Ubisoft collect?</b><br><br>In order to give you the best experience on our websites, Ubisoft may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information if you decide to:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Create a ubi.com account; 
</li><li>Apply for a beta tester position; 
</li><li>Subscribe to the ubi.com general newsletter or to a game-specific newsletter; 
</li><li>Fill out a poll or survey; 
</li><li>Email a ubi.com web page, promotion, or event to a friend (i.e., use our "tell-a-friend" feature); 
</li><li>Access and participate in our community forums and/or chat rooms; 
</li><li>Participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion; 
</li><li>Receive customer or technical support; 
</li><li>Purchase a product at our online store; and/or, 
</li><li>Register a product online for warranty protection and technical support. </li></ul>Please note that not all of the activities listed above are available to children under 13. In addition, before you can use some of the activities above, you may be required to sign up for a general ubi.com account. The ability to access certain areas and features of our websites by simply logging in is only available to those web users that have already created a username and password during an earlier visit to a Ubisoft site.<br><br>The types of personal information collected in conjunction with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity. The requested information may include: (i) your name, (ii) mailing address, (iii) telephone number, (iv) email address, and, for those purchasing products online, (v) credit card information. Parents or legal guardians providing parental consent (via our Parental Consent Form) may be asked to provide their child's name and email address in addition to information about themselves.<br><br>For some activities, we may also ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as: (i) your age or date of birth; (ii) your gender; (iii) your country and zip code of residence; (iv) your game and platform preferences; (v) information about the hardware you may own and/or the game you may have recently purchased; and, (vi) other game-related information (e.g., MMO experience) (collectively referred to as "demographic information"). If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information.<br><br><a name="3"></a><b>How does Ubisoft use the information it collects?</b><br><br>Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, if you sign up for a game-specific newsletter, the email address that you provide will only be used to send you, via email, updates regarding that particular game. Similarly, information collected from those who create a ubi.com account is used to provide registrants the benefits or services that come with registration, which often include a subscription to our general newsletter, email announcements relating to your account, free online game playing, access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions, and participation in community forums and contests and sweepstakes. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to a game-specific newsletter and vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, we will use your information to provide you such services.<br><br>We may use your email address to send you service announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, changes in pricing, changes to our online service or customer support policies, and other related service changes. Also, please note that if you create a ubi.com or game specific account and your account is later cancelled (e.g., due to lack of activity), we may subsequently contact you to let you know that we've reactivated your account for a short period of time.<br><br>In addition, personal and/or demographic information collected through one of the activities set forth above may be used for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.<br><br>No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. With respect to children under 13, we will only collect the information that is reasonably necessary to allow the child to participate in a particular activity. For more on children, please see our special children's section <a href="#12">below</a>.<br><br>Please be advised that information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., resume from job applicant) is not subject to this Privacy Policy. However, we want to assure you that information obtained from your resume will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating your submission for a job opening.<br><br><u>A Special Note about our Community Forums and Chat Rooms</u><br><br>Please note that whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on our message board, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these activities, we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of any information that you post in these areas. <u>Parents:</u> If you do not want your child to participate in community forums or chat rooms, make sure not to provide your consent to these activities on our Parental Consent Form.<br><br><a name="4"></a><b>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to Ubisoft?</b><br><br>If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to participate in many of the activities offered on our websites or purchase a product through our online store. For example, if you refuse to disclose your name or email address, you will not be able to sign up for a ubi.com account and receive the many benefits associated with that account. However, to simply browse and view certain content on our websites, you do not need to give us any personal information.<br><br><a name="5"></a><b>Does Ubisoft use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?</b><br><br>We may use cookies on our websites. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. For example, Ubisoft uses cookies to keep track of selected items in your shopping cart and to remember your login username and password. Any information collected this way is held only up until midnight of the same day, at which point, the information is deleted. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online and login.<br><br><u>IP Addresses</u><br><br>Ubisoft also keeps tracks of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for safety and security reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.<br><br><u>Log Files</u><br><br>The only other information passively collected by Ubisoft is in the form of logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These entries are generated anonymously, and enable Ubisoft to assess overall website activity, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.<br><br><a name="6"></a><b>Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?</b><br><br>Generally, the information that you disclose on a Ubisoft website is collected by Ubisoft or by a vendor on Ubisoft's behalf, and is used in accordance with the practices set forth <a href="#3">above</a>. Vendors (or agents) are entities that provide support for the internal operations of our websites and who only use the information we share with them for the purpose of carrying out the service you've requested (e.g., fulfillment of online purchases or electronic newsletter delivery).<br><br>From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions ("Promotions") on our websites and, in some instances, limit participation to ubi.com account holders. Information collected for these Promotions typically include personal information such as your email address and, if collected from users 13 years old and older, may be shared with third parties (e.g., a third-party sponsor or co-sponsor). While we have no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share with them. If you do not want your information to be shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Promotions.<br><br>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.<br><br>In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Ubisoft's customer information may be transferred to its successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.<br><br>From time to time, we are approached by reputable third-party companies that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. To extend these products or services to you, we may share with such organizations personal information collected from users 13 years old and older. We see this as a value-added service helping you find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. In addition, we will attempt to ensure that any such third parties agree to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. If you are at least 13 years old and do not want your personal information to be shared with third parties, please make sure to choose not to have your information shared at the time of registration or information collection.<br><br><a name="7"></a><b>What is Ubisoft's policy regarding links to third party sites?</b><br><br>You should be aware that while you are browsing one of our websites, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we are not responsible. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such sites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information.<br><br><a name="8"></a><b>Can I choose how my personal information is used?</b><br><br>If you do not want to receive our newsletter or any other&nbsp;promotional communications from Ubisoft,&nbsp;you are given the option to unsubscribe from these&nbsp;services either at the time of registration or information collection&nbsp;or by visiting the Edit Profile section of our websites after logging in and unchecking the appropriate box. Alternatively, you may contact us using the contact information provided <a href="#11">below</a>.<br><br>In addition, along with every newsletter sent to you, Ubisoft provides you the opportunity to discontinue receiving future newsletters (i.e., unsubscribe).<br><br>Please note that if you cancel your ubi.com or game specific account, you may be later notified that your account has been reactivated for a short period of time.<br><br><a name="9"></a><b>How can I access my personal information?</b><br><br>To review, update, or correct personal information contained in your ubi.com account, you must first login using your username and password. Then, by clicking on the Edit Profile button on the navigation bar, you can access and change your account information. If you want us to remove your name entirely from our list of ubi.com account holders or would like to access information that was collected for any other activity, please contact us using the contact information provided <a href="#11">below</a>. We will be happy to honor your request.<br><br>For those of you who have submitted a question to the Ubisoft Solution Center, the "My Stuff" link under the FAQ section of the Solution Center allows you to either check the status of your question, modify your answer update notifications, and/or update the personal profile you created when submitting your question. If you are having trouble retrieving your information this way, please feel free to contact a Support Representative at (919) 460-9778.<br><br><a name="10"></a><b>What safeguards does Ubisoft use to protect my personal information?</b><br><br>Ubisoft maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders, including children under 13. Personal information collected by Ubisoft is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by requesting that they submit information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient protection of such data.<br><br><a name="11"></a><b>How do I ask a question or file a complaint? (Contact Information)</b><br><br>If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding this Privacy Policy or our information collection practices, please contact our Privacy Policy Administrator at:<br><br>
<blockquote>Ubisoft Entertainment<br>Attn: Privacy Policy Administrator<br>625 Third Street, 3rd Floor<br>San Francisco, CA 94107<br>(415) 547-4000<br><a href="http://ubisoft.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/ubisoft.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?p_prod_lvl1=306&amp;p_prod_lvl2=%7Eany%7E&amp;p_cat_lvl1=1">Contact via Email</a> <br><br></blockquote>For complaints, you can also contact ESRB Privacy Online directly at <a href="http://www.esrb.org/" target="_blank">www.esrb.org</a> or by regular mail at 317 Madison Avenue, 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10017.<br><br><a name="12"></a><b>Ubisoft's Online Privacy Policy Regarding Children Under 13 ("Children's Privacy Policy")</b><br><br><u>Collection of Children's Personal Information</u><br><br>Ubisoft will collect personal information from visitors identified as under the age of 13 ("children" or "child"), but only under the following circumstances: the information is submitted to us in connection with an activity available to children and with the parent or legal guardian's prior verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask users who wish to participate in certain features to submit their age or date of birth. Those users that indicate they are under 13 are directed to our Parental Consent Form.<br><br>Once Ubisoft has received verifiable permission from a parent or legal guardian to collect information about a particular child, the types of information that we collect is no different than the types of information we collect from older visitors (i.e., 13 and older), as set forth <a href="#2">above</a>. As with older users, information must be submitted to us voluntarily (e.g., through the use of our Parental Consent Form). We do not gather personal information about children through the use of passive collection mechanisms such as cookies. For more information on how we use cookies and other passive collection tools, please see our section on <a href="#5">cookies</a>.<br><br>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like a contest - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. As such, we take steps to limit the amount of personal information we collect from children for various online activities. To read about the steps Ubisoft takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="#10">security</a>.<br><br>In some instances, certain portions of our site (e.g., tell-a-friend feature and certain contests) may allow children under 13 to submit personal information such as their e-mail address without first obtaining their parents' consent. Such portions of our site operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent under the law.<br><br><u>Use of Children's Personal Information</u><br><br>Please refer to our use section <a href="#3">above</a> to find out how we use information collected from children under 13.<br><br><u>Ubisoft's Contact Information</u><br><br>Any personal information that a child discloses on a Ubisoft website is collected by Ubisoft or by a vendor on Ubisoft's behalf. To contact Ubisoft, please use the <a href="#11">contact information</a> provided above.<br><br><u>Disclosure of Children's Personal Information</u><br><br>Please read our section titled <a href="#6">"Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?"</a> for our policy on the disclosure of personal information collected from and about children under 13.<br><br><u>Parental Access</u><br><br>Parents who have already given Ubisoft permission to collect and use their child's personal information for any purpose always have the right to: (1) review, correct, or have deleted their child's personal information; and/or, (2) discontinue Ubisoft's further collection or use of their child's personal information. To take any such action, please use our Edit Profile section online or contact us using the contact information provided <a href="#11">above</a>. For verification purposes, please have available your email address and the email address your child used to sign up. We will be happy to honor your request.<br><br>Also, please note that if your child created a ubi.com account with your permission, your child will also have the ability to access and update his/her account, which includes the ability to modify personal information such as e-mail address.&nbsp; This policy is set forth on our parental consent form.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br></td>
