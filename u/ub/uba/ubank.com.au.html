										<h2>Keeping your private information private</h2>

										<p>The privacy of your personal information has always been important to us at the National Australia Bank Group ("<strong>Group</strong>"). The Group is the National Australia Bank Limited and its related bodies corporate such as MLC Ltd. It includes all our banking, financing, funds management, financial planning, superannuation, insurance, broking and e-commerce organisations.</p> 

								<p>UBank is a division of the National Australia Bank Limited, and we are committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting your personal information. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) and any relevant Health Privacy Principles under State legislation<span class="footnoteText">1</span>, as well as other applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information. Our staff are trained to respect your privacy in accordance with our standards, policies and procedures.</p>

										<h2>What our Privacy Policy covers</h2>

										<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information. It also describes generally the sorts of personal information held and for what purposes, and how that information is collected, held, used and disclosed.</p> 

								<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us – both online and on the phone. However, depending on the Group organisation with which you deal, further privacy information may apply in addition to the matters discussed in this Privacy Policy (see, for example, "<span class="strongBodyText">Our Websites</span>" below). We encourage you to check our websites regularly for any updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>

										<h2>How and why we collect your personal information</h2>

										<p>If you are acquiring or have acquired a product or service from a Group organisation, it will collect and hold your personal information for the purposes of:
										</p><ul class="paddingLeftTen">
											<li>providing you with the relevant product or service (including assessing your application and identifying you);</li>
												<li>managing and administering the product or service; and</li>
											<li>protecting against fraud where it is a banking and finance, or insurance, product or service.</li>
								</ul>
										<p></p>

										<p>Group organisations may also collect your personal information for the purpose of letting you know about products or services that might better serve your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs or promotions or other opportunities in which you may be interested.</p>

									<p>The information collected may include your name, postal or email address, date of birth, financial details, tax file number, health information or other information we consider necessary.</p>

										<p>We will, if it is reasonable or practicable to do so, collect your personal information from you. This may happen when you fill out a product or service application or an administrative form (e.g. a change of address form) or when you give us personal information over the telephone or through a Group organisation’s website.</p>

											<p>In certain cases we collect your personal information from third parties. For example, we may need to collect personal information from a credit reporting agency, your representative (such as a legal adviser), your financial adviser, your employer or publicly available sources of information or any of the other organisations identified below under "<span class="strongBodyText">Using and Disclosing Your Personal Information</span>".</p>

											<h2>Who we can share your personal information with</h2>

											<p>In line with modern business practices common to many financial institutions and to meet your specific needs (such as where you have a financial adviser) we may disclose your personal information to the organisations described below.</p>

											<p><span class="footnoteText">1</span>For example, those contained in the Health Records Act 2001 (Vic), Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW) or the privacy provisions contained in Part 2 of the Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997 (ACT). </p>

								<p>Where your personal information is disclosed we will seek to ensure that the information is held, used or disclosed consistently with the National Privacy Principles, any relevant Health Privacy Principles under State legislation and other applicable privacy laws and codes.</p>
										<h3 class="legalText">The relevant organisations are those</h3>

										<ul class="paddingLeftTen">
											<li>Involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service such as third party suppliers, other Group organisations, loyalty and affinity program partners, printers, posting services, call centres, lenders mortgage insurers and our advisers.</li>

										<h3 class="legalText">In addition, for Group organisations offering</h3>

											<ul class="paddingLeftTen">

										<p>We may use or disclose your personal information to let you know about, and develop, products and services from across the Group that might better serve your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs or promotions or other opportunities in which you may be interested.

You can contact us at any time if you no longer want us to do this (see "<span class="strongBodyText">Contacting Us</span>" below). </p>

								<h2>Staying up to date with your details</h2>

										<p>We aim to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. We will take reasonable steps to make sure this is the case. This way we can provide you with better service.</p>

										<p>If you believe your personal information is not accurate, complete or up to date, please contact us (see "<span class="strongBodyText">Contacting Us</span>" below).</p>

										<h2>How we keep your personal information safe</h2>

										<p>We store information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form.

												<li>the security measures described below under "<span class="strongBodyText">Our Websites</span>".</li>
										</ul>

										<p></p>

										<h2>How we ensure your privacy on the Internet</h2>

										<h3 class="legalText">Our Websites</h3>
										<p>We take care to ensure that the personal information you give us on our websites is protected. For example, our websites have electronic security systems in place, including the use of firewalls and data encryption. Depending on the Group organisation with which you deal, user identifiers, passwords or other access codes may also be used to control access to your personal information. Please refer to the website of those Group organisations with which you transact electronically for more information on our website specific privacy and security procedures.</p>

										<p>You may be able to access external websites by clicking on links we have provided. Those other websites are not subject to our privacy standards, policies and procedures.

										</p><ul class="paddingLeftTen">

												<li>where a third party has given us health information about you in confidence</li>
												<li>denying access is required or authorised by or under law</li>
										</ul>
											<p></p> 

										<p>We will give you reasons if we deny access.

								<h2>How we use your Government Identifiers</h2>

										<p>Although in certain circumstances we are required to collect government identifiers such as your tax file number, Medicare number or pension card number, we do not use or disclose this information other than when required or authorised by law or unless you have voluntarily consented to disclose this information to any third party.</p>
