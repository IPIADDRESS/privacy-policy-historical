<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment 
  to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level 
  of integrity in dealing with our visitors, members, and partners. It is designed 
  not only to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the 
  personal information you provide to us, but also to help you in making informed 
  decisions when using our Site and our products and services. This Privacy Policy 
  will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices, 
  and our customers' needs.</font></p>

  As described below, some of your personally identifiable information will be 
  used by us and shared with third parties. By using our Web site, you expressly 
  consent to our use of your personal information, and also to the disclosure 
  to and use by third parties of this information. You acknowledge that communications 
  to, from and through the Search4 family of web sites are not confidential. You

  no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is 
  created between you and PlattForm Advertising, Inc. other than pursuant to this 
  Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the 
  terms and conditions of our Terms and Conditions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Note About Minors<br>
  In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, no 
  one under 13 years of age can use our web site. If you are a minor between the 
  ages of 13 and 18, you may use our wite only in conjunction with your parent, 
  legal guardian, or other responsible adult.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Information Do We Collect?<br>
  The goal of the Search4 family of web sites is to be your favorite college search 
  destination on the Internet by providing you with the information, services 
  and product offerings that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, we 
  collect two types of information from you when you visit our Site: personally 
  identifiable information you voluntarily choose to disclose, and "aggregate 
  information" about your use of our Site that is automatically collected 
  when you visit our web site. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide<br>
  Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us specifically 
  who you are. Personal information is collected when you voluntarily choose to 
  request information from a school that is listed on our site. As a site user, 
  you are asked to provide certain basic information such as your name, current 
  email address and programs of interest. You may also provide additional personal 
  information at your option. Further, if you choose to correspond with us through 
  email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email 
  address and our responses.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  How Do We Use The Personal Information That You Provide To Us?<br>
  Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests 
  with schools that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results, 
  we may store your information and send you updates if and when programs you 
  specified do become available. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also use personal information for purposes of administering 
  our business activities, providing customer service, and making available other 
  products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, 
  we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes 
  to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  2. Aggregate Information<br>
  Aggregate information refers to information your computer automatically provides 
  to us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples 
  include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after 
  our Web site) the date and time of your visits, the pages viewed, time spent 
  at our Web site, browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh 
  platform), and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An IP address is a number that 
  is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. When you 
  request a page from one of our Sites, our servers log your IP address to create 
  aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
  and partners, and for purposes of system administration. This allows these parties 
  to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that 
  are most relevant to your personal interests. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. "Cookies"<br>
  The Search4 family of web site, along with thousands of other web sites, uses 
  standard technologies, such as "cookies" and web server logs, to enhance 
  your web viewing experience. Cookies and web server logs automatically track 
  certain information about you that is based upon your activity on our Site. 
  A cookie is a small piece of data transferred from a web site to the hard drive 
  of your computer so that the web site may track your activities on the site. 
  Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and also 
  to evaluate our Site's visitor capacity. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each time you access our Site, our server may deliver certain 
  customized information to you based on the data stored in your cookies. Cookies 
  allow us to determine which areas and features of our Site are most popular 
  by measuring user activity. The information in the cookies lets us trace the 
  paths followed by users as they move from one page to another. Cookies let sites 
  and advertisers "remember" users across pages of a site and across 
  multiple visits to a site. This allows e-commerce and Internet advertising to: 
  personalize features such as targeted news stories, provide shopping sessions 
  and quick navigation across multiple zones of e-commerce sites, remember user 
  names and passwords for future visits, control ad frequency or the number of 
  times a user sees a given ad, and deliver advertisements targeted to a user's 
  interests. Your computer may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. 
  PlattForm Advertising, Inc. does not control these cookies, and they are not 
  subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable cookies, but access to certain 
  parts of our Web site may no longer be available to you. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sharing Information With Co-Brand Service Providers<br>
  PlattForm Advertising, Inc. offers a number of third party services from our 
  Site. If you choose to use these optional services, we may provide some of your 
  personally identifiable information to the Co-Brand Service Provider offering 
  such services. Conversely, the Co-Brand Service Provider may provide PlattForm 
  Advertising, Inc. with personal information about you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Sharing Information With Affiliated Businesses, Strategic Partners, Subsidiaries, 
  Advertisers, And Other Third Parties<br>
  We may enter into strategic marketing alliances with third parties, such as 
  advertisers, businesses, strategic partners and subsidiaries, who may be given 
  access to personal information, including your name, address, and email, for 
  the purpose of providing you with information about products and services that 
  may be of interest to you. Advertisers and other third parties may place cookies 
  on your browser when you visit our Site. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. has no 
  control over what third parties do with this information. Further, we cannot 
  and do not make any representations about the practices and policies of these 
  companies.<br>
  Information Collected In Ad Delivery</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
  companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs 
  or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these 
  third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Notice Of New Services And Changes<br>
  Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about 
  important changes to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think 
  you will find valuable. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How Do We Protect Your Information?<br>
  We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of 
  personal information we collect. This software provides a limited degree of 
  protection against unauthorized access or disclosure, as well as accidental 
  loss, alteration, or destruction.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Do We Comply With Legally Compelled Disclosure Of Information?<br>
  We may release any private information about you that we possess when we believe 
  release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms 
  and Conditions, Privacy Policy and/or other agreements, or to protect the rights, 
  property or safety of PlattForm Advertising, Inc., our Site users, or others.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  What About Other Web Sites Linked to or from Our Web Site?<br>
  The links in the Search4 family of web sites allow you to leave our Site. Please 
  be aware that once you leave our Site and enter another web site, or use certain 
  services provided through our Site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. 
  Your browsing and interaction on web sites that have a link to our Web site, 
  or any links contained in a linked site, is subject to that web site's own rules 
  and policies. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy 
  practices employed by these sites, nor the information or content contained
