	    the highest level of integrity in dealing with our visitors, members, and partners. It
	    is designed not only to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard

      Search4Texas-Colleges.com, Search4TruckDriving-Schools.com, Search4Vocational-Training.com,
      Search4Welding-Schools.com and Career Explorer (collectively and individually hereinafter
      referred to as the "Search4 family of web sites," the "Web site," or
      the "Site."). Access to and use of the Search4 family of web sites is available
      only to United States residents who can form legally binding contracts under applicable
      law. If you do not qualify, you may not use our Web site. If you are a minor, you may
      use the Search4 family of web sites only in conjunction with your parent, legal guardian,
      or other responsible adult supervision. We urge supervising adults to actively oversee
      minors' online use.<br>
  As described below, some of your personally identifiable information will be used by us and
  shared with third parties. By using our Web site, you expressly consent to our use of your
  personal information, and also to the disclosure to and use by third parties of this information.
  You acknowledge that communications to, from and through the Search4 family of web sites
  are not confidential. You agree that by submitting communications through the Search4 family
  of web sites, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is
  created between you and PlattForm Advertising, Inc. other than pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms and conditions of our Terms
  and Conditions.</p>
	<p><strong>A Note About Minors</strong><br>
  In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, no one under 13
      years of age can use our web site. If you are a minor between the ages of 13 and 18,
      you may use our wite only in conjunction with your parent, legal guardian, or other responsible
      adult.</p>
	<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong><br>
  The goal of the Search4 family of web sites is to be your favorite college search destination
      on the Internet by providing you with the information, services and product offerings
      that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, we collect two types of information
      from you when you visit our Site: personally identifiable information you voluntarily
      choose to disclose, and "aggregate information" about your use of our Site
      that is automatically collected when you visit our web site. </p>
	<p><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to
	    Provide</strong><br>
  Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us specifically who
  you are. Personal information is collected when you voluntarily choose to request information
  from a school that is listed on our site. As a site user, you are asked to provide certain
  basic information such as your name, current email address and programs of interest. You
  may also provide additional personal information at your option. Further, if you choose to
  correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together
  with your email address and our responses.</p>
	<p>
  <strong>How Do We Use The Personal Information That You Provide To Us?</strong><br>
  Broadly speaking, your personal information is used to help match your interests with schools
  that provide the training you seek. If your search yields no results, we may store your information
  and send you updates if and when programs you specified do become available. </p>
	<p>We also use personal information for
	    purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service, and making
	    available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally,
	    we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our
	    Web site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable.</p>

	<p>
  <strong>2. Aggregate Information</strong><br>
  Aggregate information refers to information your computer automatically provides to us and
  that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data
  (the web sites you visited just before and just after our Web site) the date and time of
  your visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, browser and platform type (e.g.,
  a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform), and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An IP
  address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the
  Web. When you request a page from one of our Sites, our servers log your IP address to create
  aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners,
  and for purposes of system administration. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively,
  and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests.</p>
	<p><strong>3. "Cookies"</strong><br>
  The Search4 family of web site, along with thousands of other web sites, uses standard technologies,
      such as "cookies" and web server logs, to enhance your web viewing experience.
      Cookies and web server logs automatically track certain information about you that is
      based upon your activity on our Site. A cookie is a small piece of data transferred from
      a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the web site may track your activities
      on the site. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and
      also to evaluate our Site's visitor capacity. </p>
	<p>Each time you access our Site, our server
	    may deliver certain customized information to you based on the data stored in your cookies.
	    Cookies allow us to determine which areas and features of our Site are most popular by
	    measuring user activity. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed
	    by users as they move from one page to another. Cookies let sites and advertisers "remember" users
	    across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. This allows e-commerce and
	    Internet advertising to: personalize features such as targeted news stories, provide shopping
	    sessions and quick navigation across multiple zones of e-commerce sites, remember user
	    names and passwords for future visits, control ad frequency or the number of times a user
	    sees a given ad, and deliver advertisements targeted to a user's interests. Your computer
	    may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. does
	    not control these cookies, and they are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You can disable
	    cookies, but access to certain parts of our Web site may no longer be available to you. </p>
	<p><strong>Sharing Information With Co-Brand Service
	    Providers</strong><br>
  PlattForm Advertising, Inc. offers a number of third party services from our Site. If you
  choose to use these optional services, we may provide some of your personally identifiable
  information to the Co-Brand Service Provider offering such services. Conversely, the Co-Brand
  Service Provider may provide PlattForm Advertising, Inc. with personal information about
  you.</p>
	<p><br>
      <strong>Sharing Information With Affiliated Businesses, Strategic Partners, Subsidiaries, Advertisers,
      And Other Third Parties</strong><br>
  We may enter into strategic marketing alliances with third parties, such as advertisers,
  businesses, strategic partners and subsidiaries, who may be given access to personal information,
  including your name, address, and email, for the purpose of providing you with information
  about products and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisers and other third parties
  may place cookies on your browser when you visit our Site. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. has
  no control over what third parties do with this information. Further, we cannot and do not
  make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies.<br>
  Information Collected In Ad Delivery</p>
	<p>  We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies
      may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to
      measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via
      cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>
	<p>  <strong>Notice Of New Services And Changes</strong><br>
  Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes
  to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. </p>
	<p><strong>How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong><br>
  We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information
      we collect. This software provides a limited degree of protection against unauthorized
      access or disclosure, as well as accidental loss, alteration, or destruction.</p>
	<p>  <strong>Do We Comply With Legally Compelled Disclosure Of Information?</strong><br>
  We may release any private information about you that we possess when we believe release
  is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions, Privacy
  Policy and/or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of PlattForm
  Advertising, Inc., our Site users, or others.</p>
	<p>  <strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to or from Our Web Site?</strong><br>
  The links in the Search4 family of web sites allow you to leave our Site. Please be aware
  that once you leave our Site and enter another web site, or use certain services provided
  through our Site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction
  on web sites that have a link to our Web site, or any links contained in a linked site, is
  subject to that web site's own rules and policies. PlattForm Advertising, Inc. is not responsible
  for the privacy practices employed by these sites, nor the information or content contained
  therein. We provide these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link
  does not imply endorsement by PlattForm Advertising, Inc. of the site. Please read over the
