  <p>This Website is owned and operated by the Unitarian Universalist Association. 
    We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information 
    they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Policy 
    addresses those concerns. This policy may be changed or updated from time 
    to time. </p>
  <p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: 
  </p>
  <p><b>Unitarian Universalist Association<br>
    Office of Electronic Communication<br>
    25 Beacon Street<br>
    Boston, MA 02108<br>
    or send email to <a href="mailto:eleccomdir@uua.org">eleccomdir@uua.org </a><br>
    </b> </p>
  <p>We are available to answer your questions or hear your concerns. </p>

  <p align="center"><font size="+1"><b>Privacy Policy<br>
    </b> </font> </p>
  <p>The first principle of the member societies of the Unitarian Universalist 
    Association (UUA) is that we will covenant to affirm and promote the inherent 
    worth and dignity of every person. We believe that this principle impels us 
    to protect the privacy of visitors to the UUA website. </p>
  <p><b>Personal Information</b><br>
    We only collect personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. 
    Personal information may include name, address, phone number, email address, 
    credit card numbers. We do not require this information to obtain access to 
    any part of our site. </p>
  <p>High grade encryption and https security protocols are used for collecting 
    personal information associated with financial transactions. </p>
  <p>The personal information we collect is only used by us to process a request 
    that has been placed by the visitor. Typically this is in the form of an order 
    for material from our Bookstore, but it may on occasion include other voluntary 
    submittals of similar information for survey purposes or for event registrations. 
  </p>
  <p>We do not sell or rent this personal information to other organizations. 
    However, website users should be aware that posting to the website's various 
    bulletin boards may result in their name and email address being acquired 
    by other parties. The UUA cannot prevent this from happening, since the bulletin 
    boards are open to public viewing. Bulletin board posts may also be accessed 
    as the result of a web search. The UUA also cannot prevent this from happening. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Credit Card Information </b><br>
    The UUA accepts payments for products or donations through our web site. We 
    make every effort to protect the safety and security of your transaction. 
    We use high-grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate 
    with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security 
    protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept 
    the credit card information you send to us. </p>
  <p> Information is also provided on for those who wish to make contributions 
    or purchases through the mail or via fax. </p>
  <p><b>Information Accuracy </b><br>
    Unitarian Universalist Association makes every effort to ensure that the information 
    presented is correct and accurate. However, if inaccuracies occur, the UUA 
    will make every effort to correct them in a timely manner. To report any web 
    site inaccuracies or for questions about UUA's Internet Privacy Policy please 
    email us at <a href="mailto:eleccomdir@uua.org">eleccomdir@uua.org </a>. </p>
  <p><b>Links to Third Party Sites </b><br>
    This web site contains some hyperlinks to web sites operated by parties other 
    than UUA. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference only. The UUA does 
    not control such web sites and is not responsible for their contents. The 
    inclusion of hyperlinks to other web sites does not imply any endorsement 
    of the material on these Web sites or any association with their operators. 
  </p>
  <p><b>We Care About Doing It Right</b><br>
    In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls over information 
    you share with us, the UUA works to accurately process your information. During 
    business hours, <a href="staff/index.html">staff are available</a> to answer 
    questions about your transaction. </p>
