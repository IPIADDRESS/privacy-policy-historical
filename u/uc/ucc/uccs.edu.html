<p><strong>Privacy Statement</strong> <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Commitment to Protection of Individual Privacy</strong> <br>
  The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) supports the protection of the privacy of individuals who visit official campus websites. It recognizes the numerous laws that govern the collection, storage, transfer, use and access to personally identifiable information. This statement extends to the collection of all personally identifiable information, regardless of source or medium. However, because UCCS is a state institution, some information collected from official websites may be subject to the Colorado Open Records Act (C.R.S. 24-72-201 et.seq.) In addition, UCCS may disclose information to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.<br>
  This statement does not apply to websites that are created and maintained for purposes other than conducting official university business by individual faculty, staff or students using resources made available within a university domain.</p>
<p>  <strong>Collection of Information</strong> <br>
  It is the practice of UCCS to collect the least amount of personally identifiable information required to fulfill its duties and responsibilities, to complete a particular transaction, or as required by law. A wide variety of colleges, schools, departments, divisions, and other units contribute to UCCS official web pages. Any website collecting personally identifiable information must include a privacy statement and collect only personally identifiable information required to fulfill the unit’s duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p> Information you provide will only be shared with individuals within the university community who need to know it in order to respond to your request, to provide services and to carry out university business. For the same reasons, UCCS may also share your information with other people or organizations that provide services to UCCS or help us provide services to you. UCCS<strong> </strong>requires these individuals and organizations to protect your information according to this statement and applicable law. </p>
<p> You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to UCCS via the Internet. If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still visit most UCCS websites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.</p>
<p> For website administration purposes, information, other than personally identifiable information, is collected for analysis. This information is used to help diagnose problems, assess what information is most of interest, determine technical design specifications, and identify system performance and/or problem areas, and other administrative functions. This information includes logs of user visits to UCCS websites, network traffic logs necessary to insure security and optimum performance, and small text files called “cookies” used to keep track of settings.</p>
<p>  <strong>Comments and Feedback</strong> <br>
  Send comments or questions to webdept@uccs.edu. If you send comments, please include a mailing address. Do not send attachments with the message. (Due to concern about computer viruses and the damage they cause, email messages containing attachments will be deleted without opening them.)</p>
<p>  <strong>Disclaimer</strong> <br>
  The information provided in this privacy statement should not be construed as giving business, legal or other advice, or as guaranteeing the security of information provided through UCCS websites.</p>
The foregoing policy was approved by the Chancellor's Leadership Team on April 9, 2007.<br>
<br>
Date: April&nbsp; 9, 2007<br>
Approved by: Chancellor Pam Shockley-Zalabak<br>
