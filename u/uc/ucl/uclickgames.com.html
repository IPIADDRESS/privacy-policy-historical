      <li>
       This policy covers the treatment and use of personally identifiable
       information that is collected by uclick, at any of its owned, operated or

      <li>
       This policy does not cover information that may or may not be collected by

      </li>
     </ul>
<p></p>
      
     <p>
      <b><i>How is my personally identifiable information used by uclick?</i></b>
     </p>
	 uclick is the sole owner of the information collected from the uclick service. Your Personal Information can only be collected when you voluntarily provide it.
<p>
<b>What is "Personal Information"?</b>  Personal Information is individually identifiable information about a person. This information can include a first and last name, credit card number, a home, billing or e-mail address or a personal identifier that reveals an individual's e-mail address, or a telephone or social security number. Personal information also includes a persistent identifier, such as a customer number held in a cookie (See below for definition of "cookie"), where such identifier is associated with individually identifiable information. 


      </p><p> <b>Customized Experience.</b> uclick gathers user information to provide 
        you with a customized experience on our sites and other services. Your 
        user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising 
        to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you to register 
        or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of our 
        site, register for free services, order products, enter contests or subscribe 
        to a newsletter. If you choose not to register, you may not have access 
        to areas that require personal identification. </p>
      <p> <b>Subscription Services</b>. If you subscribe to our site(s) for premium 
        content services, uclick will gather user information and personal information 
        to grant you access to the site(s). uclick may use third parties to accept 
        and process orders and credit card purchases for subscriptions, merchandise 
        and products. If you choose not to register you may not have access to 
        subscription areas that require personal identification. </p>
      <p> <b>E-mail Delivery.</b> If you register with our site(s) for daily e-mail 
        delivery, subscription services or purchase products from us, from time 
        to time, we may e-mail you with informative messages about our services 
        or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to 
        you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information. 
        These e-mails may contain code that enables our database to track your 
        usage of the e-mail, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what 
        links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information to other 
        information we have about you and may use that information to improve 
        your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to 
        you.</p>
      <p><strong>Mobile Messaging</strong>. Uclick might gather some personal 
        information specific to participating in mobile messaging programs. The 
        information requested may include contact, mobile phone numbers, carriers, 
        and models for product delivery, and demographic information. </p>
     <p>
      <b><i>When does uclick collect my information, including personally
      identifiable information?</i></b>
     </p>
      <p> <b>Free Registration.</b> When you register, uclick asks for your e-mail 
        address, a user selected user name, and other information. Once you are 
        a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide 
        additional preferential information (e.g. a member name, a nickname, and 
        certain user preferences). uclick may also ask for other optional information. 
        <a href="#kids">(See below on uclick's policy with respect to children 
        under 13)</a> </p>
      <p> <b>Subscription Services.</b> When you subscribe, uclick asks for your 
        e-mail address, a user selected user name, password and other necessary 
        financial information to process the order. Credit card information is 
        collected by uclick, however, the specific credit card number is not stored 
        within the uclick System. Contact information from the order is used to 
        fulfill premium purchases to our registered users and to get in touch 
        with the user when deemed necessary. Once you are a subscribed user you 
        can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential 
        information. uclick may also ask for other optional information. <a href="#kids">(See 
        below on uclick's policy with respect to children under 13)</a> </p>
      <p> <b>Order Forms and Products Store.</b> uclick also uses an order form 
        for users to request information, products and services. For that order 
        form, we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary 
        financial information to process the order (i.e. credit card number). 
        Contact information from the order is used to send orders to our registered 
        users and to get in touch with the user when deemed necessary. uclick 
        may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases 
        for merchandise and products. For some products, third parties host the 
        store pages, ordering system, order data, collect order information, contact 
        information and necessary financial information to process the order. 
        Please see the privacy policies on their Web sites for more information 
        about how CafePress uses this information. </p>
      <p> <b>Special Contests or Promotions.</b> uclick may occasionally present 
        a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To 
        qualify for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide 
        personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s) 
        or with others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest 
        or promotion terms. </p>
      <p> <b>IP Address.</b> An Internet Protocol (IP) address is unique string 
        of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service 
        Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
        We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server 
        and to administer our site. Your IP address also may be used to gather 
        broad demographic information. </p>
      <p> <b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small line of text that is 
        stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us 
        provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, 
        or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. uclick may utilize "cookie" 
        technology by sending and/or receiving information from our computers 
        to your browser and computer. We also use cookies to customize our site(s) 
        and deliver content specific to your interests. </p>
      <p> <b>Computer-Generated Information.</b> uclick may use server logs to 
        track your movement through our Web sites and properties - in addition, 
        we may use this information to customize the user experience or provide 
        registrant continuity between our various Web sites and properties. uclick 
        may also use other technologies to verify and track your use of certain 
        services, confirm receipt of certain e-mailed products or to test the 
        integrity of our systems, products and services. </p>
      <p> <b>Advertisements.</b> The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered 
        to you by our Web advertising partners. In the process of serving ads, 
        advertisers place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information 
        (excluding your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information) 
        about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements 
        on this site and other Web sites about goods and services that may be 
        of interest to you. By delivering ads on the Sites, uclick is able to 
        record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, 
        and what uclick site pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. 
        This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information 
        uclick has (e.g., what type of operating system your computer uses) collected 
        from your visits to uclick Sites and other sites not affiliated with uclick. 
        This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad 
        serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see 
        online at uclick Sites. Additionally, some ads are generated by third 
        party ad serving systems that also may place a cookie on your browser 
        to provide web usage information to those third parties. Please note that 
        if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience 
        (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 
        13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the 
        advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the 
        audience they are trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize 
        our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery 
        and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor 
        do we give them access to, any personally identifying information about 
        you. To find out more about those specific third party ad serving systems, 
        please click to their sites below: </p>

      <p> <b>Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers</b><br>
        We recognize that not all users wish to receive ads targeted to their 
        interests and we put the wishes of our users first. If you want to prevent 
        a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, 
        currently you must visit each ad network’s Web site individually 
        and opt out of this type of advertising. You may find more information 
        from these sites:<br>

        replaces a network advertiser's unique online preference marketing cookie 
        on your browser with a general opt-out cookie; it does not delete cookies 
        and does not necessarily replace other cookies placed by network advertisers, 
        such as those that are used for aggregate ad reporting or mere ad serving 
        purposes. Such cookies allow network advertisers to rotate ad banners 
        sequentially and track aggregate numbers of impressions. Please see the 
        companies' privacy policies for more details or visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_new">NAI 
        web site</a> for more information. For us at uclick, the most important 
        thing is that you make the choice that is best for you. </p>
      <p> <b>Links to Other Sites.</b> The uclick Sites contain links, including 
        banner and other ads, to other Web sites. uclick is not responsible for 
        the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. The uclick Sites 
        may also link to Web sites that feature uclick trademarks and names along 
        with trademarks and names of other companies. You should look at the privacy 
        policy on that co-branded Web site, as the co-branded Web site may not 
        be under uclick's control. </p>
      <p> <b>Information from Other Sources.</b> For reasons such as improving 
        member experience and providing customized communications to our users, 
        we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to 
        the information that we have received from you. </p>
     <p>
      <b><i>Who does uclick share information with?</i></b>
     </p>
      <p> We will not share your personally identifiable information with third 
        parties (aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling 
        orders, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have 
        privacy policies that protect your information) unless you have "opted-in" 
        to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under 
        a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in 
        under this Privacy Statement. As stated, uclick may use third parties 
        to accept and process orders for merchandise and products. For some products 
        purchases, CafePress hosts the store pages, ordering system, and order 
        data. Please see the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">CafePress Privacy Policy</a> for more information 
        about how CafePress uses this information. </p>
      <p> However, uclick may disclose information you provide if required to do 
        so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary 
        to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on uclick; (2) 
        protect and defend the rights or property of uclick; or (3) act in an 
        emergency to protect someone's safety. </p>
      <p> We may gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, 
        education level or household income) from time to time. We will not share 
        that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with 
        any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection 
        or we have your permission. When we share demographic information with 
        third parties, we will give them aggregate information only. </p>
      <p> As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending 
        upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred 
        assets. In the event that uclick is acquired by another company, your 
        personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring 
        party. <br>
      </p>
     <p>
       <b><i>What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable
      information?</i></b>
     </p>
      <p> You will have the ability to request the deletion of your uclick registration 
        at any time by utilizing the registration system established for this 
        purpose. However, we may maintain certain other information as part of 
        our internal processes to prevent accidental loss of user data or information 
        and to prevent or discourage fraudulent activities that may involve uclick 
        registration or account information. We may also continue to maintain 
        information about your registration or account and your computer access 
        to our Web sites or services as part of our server logs</p>
     <p>
      Unless you opt-out we may e-mail you with information from uclick, including
      information about selected third parties. If you do not want to receive
      information from uclick or third parties that we have selected, you may
      decline to receive it (or "Opt-Out") when you provide personal information to
      uclick, or you may visit <a href="https://register.uclick.com/reg/sign-in">https://register.uclick.com/reg/sign-in</a> and update your profile. You may also contact

       <b><i><a name="kids">What about kids' personally identifiable
      information?</a></i></b>
     </p>
      <p> The uclick Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to 
        children under the age of 13. uclick assumes products purchased through 
        credit card means are purchased by adults. uclick respects the privacy 
        of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's 
        Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that 
        ask for age, uclick does not collect personal information from individuals 
        who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited 
        circumstances where uclick believes that such collection is permitted 
        under COPPA. </p>
      <p> uclick may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration 
        process and on other areas of the uclick Sites. If a user indicates that 
        he or she is under the age of 13 then all personal data collected during 
        the registration process is automatically deleted except uclick may retain 
        and use limited information, such as the child's e-mail address, for a 
        limited period of time, in those cases where uclick believes that the 
        collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA. </p>
      <p> If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information 
        to uclick, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed

      <p><strong>uclick's Commitment to Data Security </strong>Protecting user 
        privacy and Personal Information is a high priority for uclick. </p>
      <p>We use our best efforts to ensure the security of your Personal Information. 
        uclick maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply 
        with federal regulations to guard your Personal Information. We exercise

        and processors whose jobs require accessing users' Personal Information 
        are granted database access or administrator-level accounts on servers 
        that contain such Personal Information. Finally, all servers containing 
        users' Personal Information are kept locked in a secure data center and 
        require a secure login to access them remotely.
