          <span class="content_header">Introduction</span><br>
    University College Dublin has published this Privacy Statement to demonstrate
    our firm commitment to the privacy of users of our Website. This policy relates
    to websites hosted under the ucd.ie domain only. The University does not
    accept responsibility for the content or privacy practices of other external
    websites. External links to other websites are not always clearly identifiable
    as such. Within the UCD domain you may find websites over which the University
    does not maintain editorial responsibility or direct control. Such sites
    can include the websites of student organisations etc. While UCD encourages
    compliance with this web privacy statement at such sites, please consult
    the privacy statements of individual sites or contact the persons responsible
    for those sites, in order to understand the policies and practices under
    which they operate. </p>
      <p><span class="content_header">General statement</span><br>
    University College Dublin fully respects your right to privacy and actively
      seeks to preserve the privacy rights of those who share information with
      the University. Any personal information you provide to the University
      will be treated with the highest standards of security and confidentiality,
      in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. </p>
      <p><span class="content_header">Processing of personal information</span><br>

      the University by e-mail. </p>
      <p>The University will not process any personal information about you on
        this website without your permission, save in cases where the University
        is required by law to do so, such as the investigation of a criminal
        offence by the Gardai, or a breach of the University’s Computer
        and Network Systems Acceptable Use Policy. </p>
      <p>Any information you provide is not made available to any third parties,
        and is used by the University only in accordance with the purpose for
        which you provided the information and will only be retained for as long
        as required for the purpose. This is normally stated on the web-page
        where the information is requested and should be self-explanatory. However,
        if you have any specific queries about the purpose for which your information
        is to be used, you should contact our Records Manager before submitting
        the information. University policy and procedures relating to the processing
