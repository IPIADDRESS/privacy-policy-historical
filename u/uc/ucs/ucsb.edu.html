<h1>University of California, Santa Barbara Privacy Notification Statement</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>The privacy of visitors  to a University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Web site is important to  UCSB. Our Web site privacy practices are summarized below and apply to all  authorized UCSB Web sites. Our practices are reviewed periodically for compliance  with federal and state laws and University of California policy.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>Log Information</h3>

<p>When you visit UCSB Web sites, our servers may automatically record (or  log) information that your browser sends. This information may include: your  Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, the date and time of  your request, the number of times a Web page was accessed, the paths (links)  taken through the Web site, and search terms entered on our search engines. Our  Web sites may also collect information about the internet address (URL or IP)  of the referring site. This type of information is collected to improve Web  site or individual Web page content, monitor performance, improve functionality  (including navigation and searches), site security, troubleshooting, and to  provide services to you. UCSB uses third party web analysis services to help  gather and analyze this information. For details, please see the advisory on <strong>Web Analysis Tools </strong>(<a href="http://www.policy.ucsb.edu/information/info-pract/web-analysis/">http://www.policy.ucsb.edu/information/info-pract/web-analysis/</a> )</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Some of our sites may  employ cookies. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that  is either maintained only for the duration of a particular session visit  (called a session cookie) or is stored on your computer to uniquely identify  your browser to support future visits (a persistent cookie). A session cookie  terminates when the visitor closes the browser, the data is not stored. UCSB  sites that use persistent cookies store the information collected during the  visit to make subsequent visits more efficient for the visitor. Cookies provide  usage statistics about our Web sites; as we understand how our sites are used  we can facilitate navigation in our UCSB Web space and enhance the visitor's  experience. Cookies may also be used for authentication processes (site  security purposes). You may remove UCSB persistent cookies from your computer  at any time by following your internet browser directions. If you prefer not to  receive a cookie, you may set your browser to refuse it or set it to ask you  whether you want to accept a particular cookie. However, some pages may not  function properly if the cookies are turned off.</p>

<h3>Visitor Communications</h3>

<p>
If you make an inquiry via our Web sites, those communications will be used to respond to you and to improve services.  Unless you request otherwise, your inquiry may be forwarded to another UCSB addressee who may be more appropriate to respond.  We recommend that you do not include in your inquiry social security numbers, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.  Email is not a secure medium.
</p>

<h3>Information You Voluntarily Provide</h3>

<p>On some of our Web  sites, you may choose to provide information to us to obtain services or  information. For example, you may sign up for a mailing list or send us your  address so we may send you an application or other material. We will use your  information to respond to your request and may also use it to keep you informed  of other campus activities, programs, or for future communications. You may opt  out of these additional types of communications at any time by following the  Web site's unsubscribe instructions or by directing your request to the contact  for the Web site on which you provided the original information.<br>
Other types of  personally identifiable information that you may provide to us on our Web sites  can include: name, address, telephone numbers, birthday, student identification  number, social security number, credit card number, user name, password, and/or  net-id. This information will be used to respond to you or to provide you with  a requested service, such as enrollment, purchases, making a donation, and  other educational, research, service programs or administrative purposes. In  some cases, the information requested is mandatory in order for us to provide  you with the information or service you seek. These fields will be marked with  an "*". If you do not wish to provide the mandatory information, you  may contact the specific Web site's contact person and ask whether there is an  alternate method for you to provide the required information to obtain the  service. Article IX, Section 9 of the California Constitution grants authority  to the University of California to maintain this information.<br>
Please be aware that we  will never use an email note to ask you to provide confidential or restricted  information. If you receive such an email request, it is not from UCSB  regardless of the purported sender's identification. We recommend that you do  not respond to that email.<br>
We will not sell or  share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your  consent, unless required by law or legal instruments. We retain the information  only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected  and to comply with laws and retention requirements. </p>

<h3>Information Children May Voluntarily Provide</h3>

<p>
If a UCSB site collects information from children (an individual under the age of 13), information will be collected, maintained, and secured in compliance with the provisions of the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a>.  If you are a parent or guardian, you can help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on UCSB Web sites without your permission.
</p>

<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>

<p>UCSB Web sites may  contain links to non-University sites (Third Party Sites). UCSB is not  responsible for nor does it control the content, use, or retention of  information found on linked Third Party Sites. Third party sites may collect or  solicit data from you or place their cookies or other files on your computer.  Checking the privacy statement of a Third Party Site is recommended. UCSB does  not endorse the services or products found on Third Party Sites.</p>

<h3>Choices</h3>

<p>You have the option to  decline providing information about your self online  and may use other methods, such as the U.S. mail to submit requests. You may  ask the individual identified as the contact for the Web site you're visiting  whether there are additional alternatives to obtaining the information or  services you seek.</p>

<h3>Updating Personal Information</h3>

<p>
To review, update, or correct inaccurate personal information you've previously provided or to delete it, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for a university business purpose, direct your request to the contact for the Web site on which you provided your personal information.
</p> 

<h3>Security Practices</h3>

All UCSB employees, including Web site operators are charged with complying with  all applicable laws and University policies governing privacy and the  confidentiality of personal information. Information that doesn't fall under  established legal protections is subject to public disclosure under law.</p>
