<p>Our Web server automatically recognizes only the domain name of each
visitor to our Web site, not the e-mail address. This information is used
to help improve the site's functionality. We make use of Cookies technology
in our shopping cart, but that information is stored on the visitor's computer,
not on our server. The shopping cart accesses that information to allow
the visitor to collect items in a personal shopping cart, remove them,
change them, and add to them indefinitely without making a purchase. The
shopping cart keeps track of the visitor's selections and calculates charges.
The information stored in Cookies is never collected, reviewed, or in any
way made use of except in the automated processing of the customer's submitted
order. (If you would like to know more about Cookies, please see <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/HTTP/Protocol_Specification/Persistent_Cookies/">more

and street address are stored in our order processing system (e-mail addresses
are not stored) and the customer may receive follow-up mailings from us
with information on new titles or upcoming events. If a customer does not
wish to receive such mailings or does not wish to have his or her name
made available to other similar organizations, it is requested that we
receive notification in writing at the address below.
