				<p>
					In the course of operating the Platform, MDx will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.

					<li>
					Personal Information
						<p>
							For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is information that (i) You voluntarily provide to Us or is obtained by Us through Your Use of the Platform, and (ii) that personally identifies You. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, Your name, email or other address, fax number, mailing address, business address, phone number, billing and payment information and other data that can be used to personally identify or contact You. If You decide to utilize any of the Products and Services, including, for example and where available, scheduling an appointment with a Healthcare Provider through the Platform, Your Personal Information may also contain sensitive personal information, including any confidential health information (such as your reason for scheduling the provider appointment) that You voluntarily provide.
						</p>
						<p>
							Vitals may obtain, collect, retain, store or otherwise maintain Your Personal Information from the following sources:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Your UCompareHealthCare Account: This information may include, for example, information You provide to MDx through Your creation, registration and maintenance of a user account (“UCHC Account”) on the Platform (“Registration Information”).
							</li>
							<li>
								Purchase of Products and Services: To the extent that We offer Products and Services for purchase on the Platform, we may request that You provide Personal Information, a credit card account number and/or or other payment account information in order for You to access or purchase those Products and Services.
							</li>

								Other Information You Provide to MDx: Some of the Products and Services allow or require You to provide Personal Information, such as Your Healthcare Providers, pharmacies, insurance information, emergency contact information, personal health information and related information. Personal Information that You may store through the App by means of taking a photograph with Your mobile device (for example, taking a photograph of Your health insurance card) is stored exclusively on Your mobile device and is not stored or collected by MDx. Accordingly, the safety, security and privacy of Your mobile device and the information and photographs that You store on it are Your responsibility and not the responsibility of MDx.
							</li>
							<li>
								Interactive Products and Services: Some of the Products and Services allow You to interact with Healthcare Providers through the Platform. These interactive Products and Services include, but are not limited to, scheduling appointments with Healthcare Providers. In order to provide you with these interactive Products and Services, We may ask you to provide Personal Information (such as the medical reasons for You scheduling the appointment). You understand and agree that MDx may use and/or disclose such Personal Information to Healthcare Providers that You have selected in connection with providing You with the requested interactive Products and Services.
							</li>
							<li>
								Your Responses to Communications from MDx: From time to time, MDx may communicate with You through postal mail, email, fax, telephone, or other forms of electronic communications regarding Your UCHC Account on the Platform, inquiries you may make to MDx customer service, the Products and Services and new Products and Services. If You respond to these communications, Your responses may also contain Personal Information.
							</li>
							<li>
								Online Appointments: You may schedule an on-line appointment with a Healthcare Provider through the Platform (“OLA”). In order to do so, You must submit the requested appointment information, including but not limited to Your Personal Information, dates, times, reasons of visit, and any other health-related information (“OLA Information”). The OLA Information meets the definition of Protected Health Information (“PHI”) as that term is defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, in effect or as amended (collectively, “HIPAA”). MDx is not a “Covered Entity” as that term is defined under HIPAA. Although MDx is not a Covered Entity, We are committed to User privacy and have in place strict data security policies and measures, and ensure that Users control access to their information. To the extent that MDx has received your OLA Information from a Covered Entity (as defined under HIPAA), in its capacity as a Business Associate (as defined under HIPAA), the terms of the applicable Business Associate Agreement shall govern MDx’s’ use and disclosure of such OLA Information, and shall supersede the foregoing in the event of an inconsistency between the two. MDx may engage third party subcontractors (“Third Party”) to process Your OLA request. You acknowledge and agree that any information that you submit in connection with such OLA request will be submitted to such Third Party and will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of use of such Third Party. To the extent MDx engages such Third Parties, MDx shall ensure that any such Third Party to whom it provides PHI agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to MDx with respect to such PHI. Your Healthcare Provider should be particularly aware of its obligations of confidentiality with respect to your PHI, including, without limitation, its obligations under United States state and federal laws, in particular HIPAA.  If You wish to restrict the uses of Your PHI, amend, or receive an accounting of the disclosures of your PHI, you must contact Your Healthcare Provider. MDx does not have, and does not assume, any responsibility for the confidentiality of communications between You and Your Healthcare Provider, other than those expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, or any responsibility for a violation of HIPAA by Your Healthcare Provider. When You use the OLA service, you may automatically receive administrative emails from Us. You cannot opt-out of receiving administrative emails sent by Us.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							You can decline to provide Your Personal Information to Us by not engaging in the activities described above, such as by not registering or creating a UCHC Account on the Platform or by not using the Products and Services. If you decline to submit Personal Information, MDx may not be able to or may choose not to provide to You some or all of its Products and Services. Accordingly, You can determine to a large extent what Personal Information You wish to provide to Us.
