<h3>INFORMATION SECURITY</h3>
<p>We take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Your Information, including Personal Information stored or maintained on our servers and other systems. These measures include internal reviews of UCHC’s data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to servers and systems where UCHC stores personal data.</p>
<p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, We cannot guaranty the security of Your Information, including Personal Information.</p>
<h3>DATA INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>UCHC processes Personal Information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. UCHC though, must depend on You and our other Users to provide, accurate, complete and current Personal Information and to update or correct their Personal Information whenever necessary.

<h3>ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Information You Provide When Registering For a UCHC Account</p>
<p>You may change or update the e-mail address and password that You provided when You registered for Your UCHC Account via the “settings” or “account settings” section of such account. If You registered separately for a UCHC Account on both the Website and the App, changes or updates to registration information should be made separately on each account. You may terminate Your UCHC Account by sending an e-mail with your account termination request to <a href="mailto:info@ucomparehealthcare.com">info@ucomparehealthcare.com</a>.</p>
<p>Information You Store or Access When Using the Products and Services</p>
<p>When you use the Products and Services, We make good faith efforts to provide You with access to Your Personal Information. You may organize or delete or change certain of the information that is entered or uploaded into Your UCHC Account (such as for patients, the names of Your Healthcare Providers, pharmacies, insurance information, emergency contact information, personal health information and related information, and such as for physicians, the address where Your practice is located, Your photograph and Your practice specialty) via the section of Your UCHC Account where the information is located. Where applicable, We ask individual Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where We provide information access and correction, We provide this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. If you have any questions or want more information about accessing or updating Your Personal Information, please contact UCHC by e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@ucomparehealthcare.com">info@ucomparehealthcare.com</a>.</p>
<p>All deletions, changes or updates that you make to Your Personal Information and UCHC Account termination requests will take effect after We receive and process Your e-mail termination request. Except for deleted information that was stored exclusively on Your mobile device, residual copies of the deleted information, may remain in perpetuity in backup systems.</p>
<p>Deleting the App from Your mobile device will not terminate Your UCHC Account but will delete any information that You stored through the App by means of taking a photograph with Your mobile device (“Stored Photographic Information”). Terminating Your UCHC Account will not delete Stored Photographic Information unless You also delete the App from Your mobile device.</p>
<p>Please note though that according to the Terms of Use, Your Submissions to the Platform should not include any “personally identifiable information (other than the name of the Healthcare Providers being reviewed).” This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information that You may nevertheless include in your Submissions and You may not be able to change or update any such Personal Information included in Your Submissions.</p>

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through any website without their permission.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
