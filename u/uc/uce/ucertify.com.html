<p><b>Cookies:</b> <br>
uCertify uses "cookies" to allow customers to add items to the "basket", to travel to other pages within the site, and then to return to find their basket contents intact. Cookies are also used to make sure that your order information is moved to our secure server correctly. Therefore, two things are true about cookies. One, you must "allow" cookies for the basket to work -- and thus to be able to purchase products online. Two, the cookies will expire after your close/quit your browser. </p>
