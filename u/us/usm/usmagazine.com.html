This privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) explains our information collection practices at usmagazine.com, other websites owned by us and our other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile websites and applications (each, an “<strong>Us Application</strong>”) and through offline means.  It explains the types of information we collect regarding users of the Us Application and subscribers to our magazine and how we may use that information so you can make an informed decision about whether to view the content and/or use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>").  Thus this Privacy Policy applies to information we collect via (1) the Us Application (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic newsletters; (3) offline means such as telephone and traditional mail; and (4) any other means or applications in which you connect with us.</p><p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Us Application's <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>. Each time that you access or use the Us Application you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using our Services.</p><h3 id="info-collected">1.  Information That Is Collected</h3><p>When you provide us with contact or other information in connection with a particular activity, product or service, including your email address or telephone number, you expressly consent to our communicating with you about our products or services using the information you provided to us.  You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p><h4>(a) Information You Provide To Us</h4><p><em><strong>Personal Information</strong></em>.  We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information, including information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, gender, e-mail address, date of birth, physical address (or elements thereof such as zip code and state).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Us Application, including magazine subscription forms, account registration forms, contact us forms or when you otherwise interact with us.</p><p><em><strong>Billing and Credit Card Information</strong></em>.  To enable payment for subscriptions, we collect and store billing and credit card information.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit cards.</p><p><em><strong>Social Networking Services</strong></em>.  You may be given the option to link your account on a third party social networking service. In that case, the authentication of your login credentials are conducted through that third party service provider.  When you link your social networking accounts with Us Applications or engage with Us Applications through third party social media platforms. In addition, as you interact with the Us Applications, you may also be providing information about your activities to the third party social networking services. You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information your third party social networking services may make available to us by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services.  We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share and provide access to all information that we receive through third party social networking services in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy. You agree that we shall not be liable for the use by social networking services of any information.</p><p><em><strong>Job Applications</strong></em>. When applying for select job postings via the Us Application, you may elect to send us your resume or other relevant information online.  Personal information collected in association with job postings will be used for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings.</p><h4>(b) Information Collected As You Access and Use the Us Application</h4><p>In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers and advertisers on the Us Application may use a variety of technologies (including cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts) (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”) that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Us Application (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).  This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Us Application and all of the areas within our Us Application that you visit, among other information.   We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for your computer or other device used to access the Us Application (any, a “<strong>Device</strong>”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Us Application, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  If you accessed content through an email account, a third party provider may make a “hash” of your email address, which is a bit of text that uniquely identifies the email address but is designed to prevent reverse engineering so that the email address is not revealed (“<strong>Hash</strong>”).</p><p>Information gathered from your use of the Us Application may be combined with information from third party sources to identify your location by state and region (“<strong>Region Location</strong>”).  More specific information about your geographic location may be collected for certain Us Applications ("<strong>Geolocation</strong>"), as more clearly spelled out in this policy.</p><p>A few of the Tracking Technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p><p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Us Application. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Us Application and for other purposes, as described further in this Privacy Policy. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.  We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.”  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Us Application and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Us Application easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.  “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Us Application may not function properly.</p><p><em><strong>Web Beacons</strong></em>.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Us Application, to monitor how users navigate the Us Application, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p><p><em><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong></em>.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Us Application, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Us Application, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p><p id="html5"><em><strong>HTML5</strong></em>. We use HTML5 in the Us Weekly mobile website and certain mobile applications for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p><p id="info-collected-geolocation"><em><strong>Geolocation Us Applications</strong></em>. For certain of the mobile Us Applications, we may, and may enable a third party such as an advertiser to, ask you if you wish us to collect your geolocation in order provide you with information about goods and services within your geographic location. If you agree to have your geolocation collected, we and the third party, if applicable, will maintain information about your geolocation to facilitate your searching or implement other functionality in the Us Application, such as to serve targeted advertising.
