<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>

<p>The website usmagazine.com is owned and operated by Us Weekly LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “<strong>we,</strong>” “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”).  This privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) explains our information collection practices at usmagazine.com, other websites owned by us and our other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile websites and applications (each, an “<strong>Us Application</strong>”) and through offline means.  It explains the types of information we collect regarding users of the Us Application and subscribers to our magazine and how we may use that information so you can make an informed decision about whether to view the content and/or use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>").  Thus this Privacy Policy applies to information we collect via (1) the Us Application (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic newsletters; (3) offline means such as telephone and traditional mail; and (4) any other means or applications in which you connect with us.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Us Application's <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>. Each time that you access or use the Us Application you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using our Services.</p>

<h3>1.	Information That Is Collected</h3>

<p>When you provide us with contact or other information in connection with a particular activity, product or service, including your email address or telephone number, you expressly consent to our communicating with you about our products or services using the information you provided to us.  You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>

<h4>(a)	Information You Provide To Us</h4>

<p><em><strong>Personal Information</strong></em>.  We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information, including information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, gender, e-mail address, date of birth, physical address (or elements thereof such as zip code and state).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Us Application, including magazine subscription forms, account registration forms, contact us forms or when you otherwise interact with us.</p> 

<p><em><strong>Billing and Credit Card Information</strong></em>.  To enable payment for subscriptions, we collect and store billing and credit card information.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit cards.</p>

<p><em><strong>Social Networking Services</strong></em>.  You may be given the option to link your account on third party social networking service. In that case, the authentication of your login credentials are conducted through that third party service provider.  When you link your social networking accounts with Us Applications or engage with Us Applications thorough third party social media platforms, you understand that you may be allowing us ongoing access to certain information stored on those social networking media platforms. You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information your third party social networking services may make available to us by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services.  We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share and provide access to all information that we receive through third party social networking services in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>(b)	Information Collected As You Access and Use the Us Application</h4>

<p>In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers and advertisers on the Us Application may use a variety of technologies (including cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts) (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”) that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Us Application (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).  This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Us Application and all of the areas within our Us Application that you visit, among other information.   We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for your computer or other device used to access the Us Application (any, a “<strong>Device</strong>”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Us Application, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  If you accessed content through an email account, a third party provider may make a “hash” of your email address, which is a bit of text that uniquely identifies the email address but is designed to prevent reverse engineering so that the email address is not revealed (“<strong>Hash</strong>”).</p>

<p>Information gathered from your use of the Us Application may be combined with information from third party sources to identify your location by state and region (“<strong>Region Location</strong>”).  More specific information about your geographic location may be collected for certain Us Applications ("<strong>Geolocation</strong>"), as more clearly spelled out in this policy.</p>

<p>A few of the Tracking Technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p>

<p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em>.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Us Application.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Us Application.  Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.  We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.”  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Us Application and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Us Application easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.  “Flash cookies,” known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

<p><em><strong>Web Beacons</strong></em>.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Us Application, to monitor how users navigate the Us Application, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong></em>.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Us Application, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Us Application, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

<p id="html5"><em><strong>HTML5</strong></em>. We use HTML5 in the Us Weekly mobile website and certain mobile applications for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>

<p><em><strong>Geolocation Us Applications</strong></em>. For certain of the mobile Us Applications that have search functionality, we may, and may enable a third party such as an advertiser to, ask you if you wish us to collect your geolocation in order provide you with information about goods and services within your geographic location. If you agree to have your geolocation collected, we and the third party, if applicable, will maintain information about your geolocation to facilitate your searching.  In addition, when you have geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other Device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on those Devices.</p>
    
<h4>(c)	Information You Provide About a Third Party</h4>

<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Us Application, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a subscriber to our magazine or newsletter, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Us Application, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>

<h4>(d)	Information We Collect from Third Parties</h4>
    
<p>We may acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic information and lifestyle information.

<h4 id="third-party">(g)	Use of Tracking Technologies (e.g., Cookies) by Third Party Service Providers; Advertising</h4>

<p>We may work with third parties to provide services on the Us Applications.  For example, we use analytics services supported by third party companies to perform analytics and track trends. We work with other third parties to provide certain functionalities on the Us Applications and to improve the effectiveness of the Us Application and its content. Those third party companies may use Tracking Technologies to collect and store information about you and your usage of the Us Applications and may combine this information with information they collect from other sources.</p>

<p>If you access the Us Applications through a mobile device or app, we may also share your information with mobile carriers, operating systems and platforms.</p>

<p>We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your usage of the Us Applications to deliver ads that are relevant to you.  We may use information about your visits over time and across the Us Application and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you on the Us Applications.</p>

<p>To provide ads on the Us Applications, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others.  These third parties may use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the Us Application.  They automatically receive your Device Identifier when this happens.  Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad on an Us Application and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The third party service providers, as well as the advertisers themselves, may collect and use information about your visits over time and across the Us Application and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you on the Us Application.  Third parties may also use information gathered from your usage of the Us Application to serve targeted advertisements to you on third party websites and applications.</p>

<p>We do not control Tracking Technologies used by third parties, and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing the Tracking Technologies.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices.  If you would like more information regarding which third party companies we use to provide advertising and other services and who may be serving cookies or using other Tracking Technologies on the Us Applications, please click <a href="/celebrity-news/page/third-party-technologies">here</a>.</p>

<p>Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising on some of the Us Applications.  They use the DART cookie to serve ads.  We also use the Google Doubleclick Ad Exchange Network on some of the Us Applications.  You can learn how to opt out of receiving Google cookies by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy located at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Us Application and/or third party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies, you can go to <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>. If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising and to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info</a>. Please note that the-opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out is applied.</p>

<h4>(h)	Browser Do Not Track Signals</h4>

<p>Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitor’s choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests.  As a result we do not respond to these signals.  Go to <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info</a> if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements.</p>

<h4>(i)	Co-branded Areas</h4>

<p>Certain areas of the Us Application may be provided to you in association with third parties, such as retailers, sponsors or advertisers (“<strong>Co-Branded Areas</strong>”), and may request that you disclose Personal Information.  Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party.  If you elect to register for or purchase products and/or services at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Your personal information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party.

Information about our visitors and registered users may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, support or funding.  In such transactions, use of such information will be subject to the rights and obligations as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

In addition, when you are on the Us Application you may be directed to other web sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or third party web sites.  For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, the “click” may take you off the Us Application onto a different web site.  These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.  We encourage you to note when you leave our Us Application and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites before submitting any Personal Information to those sites.</p>
