(More technically, it is information for future use that is stored by the server on the client side of a client/server communication.) It is possible to disable the accepting of cookies by your web browser, however doing so may restrict your ability to access some web pages. <p>Some University sites are access restricted. These sites may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest. Cookies may also be used for authentication purposes, and to improve security during a visitor's session online.</p>
            <p>Cookies may store the following information: session (numbered key) and duration. A numbered key is a unique server generated number used to identify the current session. The session key can be linked back to a user's login identification.</p>
            <p>Unique identifiers (such as login identification) are collected from Web site visitors to verify the user's identity, and for use as account numbers in our record system.</p>
            <p>Unique identifiers are also used to store information about visitor's preferences, to enable the dynamic display of the site according to your preferences when you return.</p>
