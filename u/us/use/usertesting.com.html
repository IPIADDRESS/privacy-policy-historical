												<p>
													We understand that your privacy is of the utmost importance to you. 
													UserTesting.com is committed to protecting the privacy and confidential 
													information of those who register.
												</p>
												<h1 style="MARGIN-TOP: 30px">Your Personal Information</h1>
												<p>
												UserTesting.com collects personal information that you provide to us. Our 
												software uses the personal information to personalize and manage the 
												UserTesting.com website for you.
												</p><p>When you sign up with us, UserTesting.com logs you in automatically using your 
													email address. This makes it easier for you as you don't have to create and 
													remember a login identifier. The use of your email address for login also 
													allows UserTesting.com the chance to email you a new password in case you 
													forget or lose your old one. This is perfectly OK and happens to the best of 
													us, particularly those of us that are incredibly busy.</p>
												<p>Anyone using UserTesting.com warrants and promises that they are 13 years of age 
													or older. UserTesting.com does not intend to collect personally identifying 
													information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13 we 
													ask that you do not use this web service.
												</p>
												<p><b>The personal information that you share with us is not going anywhere off of our 
														site.</b> We won't sell your personal information to anyone. There might be 
													one exception in the event UserTesting.com itself is sold. In this case we 
													would transfer your personal information to our buyers so that they could 
													continue to provide the same great UserTesting.com service.</p>
												<p>
												UserTesting.com may disclose to authorized law enforcement personnel the 
												personal data from anyone who poses a threat. This might include those that are 
												attempting to commit fraud or those who conduct activities that could bring 
												harm to others. We assume that this is not you so please don't worry.
												</p><p>UserTesting.com has a sophisticated security program intended to keep the 
													information stored in our system protected from unauthorized access. We store 
													your information in a secure data center located in the United States. Our 
													system is configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and 
													firewalls constructed to the highest industry standards. We also use Secure 
													Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the 
													Internet. The bottom line is, when it comes to information security, we mean 
													business.</p>
												<p>When you visit UserTesting.com we may store information about your web session 
													and assign you one or more 'cookies'. Your browser will store these cookies on 
													your computer in a small text file. For example, when you decide to login as a 
													UserTesting.com member, we store encrypted information in your browser so you 
													don't have to login on every page.</p>
												<p>Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you delete 
													them manually using your browser or operating system software. You can enable 
													your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may disable access to some 
													services and tools that we offer.</p>
												<p>UserTesting.com reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time. 
													If there are material changes to this statement on how UserTesting.com will use 
													your personal information, we will prominently post these changes prior to 
													implementing them. If you use our website after we post these changes, this 
													indicates your acceptance of them. Regardless of later updates, we will follow 
													the privacy practices described in this privacy statement at the time you 
													provided us with your information.
												</p>
												<h1 style="MARGIN-TOP: 30px">Your Videos</h1>
												<p>Videos and reviews that are done for your company will be kept confidential. Any 
													samples that appear on our home page weren't paid for.</p>
												<p>
													If you have questions about our privacy policy, please <a href="contactus.aspx">contact 
														us</a>.
