Does EZ93 Pass On The Information It Gathers?</p>

<p>Personal information about you is not hired out or sold to third parties. EZ93 reserves the right to forward the data to Zoftar Ltd (Our PCI Compliant Payment Provider). EZ93 can forward your personal information to the following entities:

Companies operating on our behalf: we hire other companies to carry out certain business activities for us. In the process, it might under certain circumstances be necessary to access your personal information. We urge these companies to use the information solely for the provision of the agreed services. The companies are not permitted to transmit the information to third parties, unless this is necessitated by service provision. These business activities include, for example, the execution of orders, the processing of vouchers, bonuses and discounts, the conduct of customer questionnaires, and information management tasks. We also provide particular service providers with compilations of general information. Web pages of subsidiaries and partners: EZ93 forwards information to partner companies which make special offers or run promotional campaigns jointly on web pages of subsidiaries within our website. They are informed about the forwarding of the information when they are requested to provide personal information on websites of this kind. The respective partner company’s use of information transmitted in this way is governed by the partner’s own data protection guidelines. You should read this information in its entirety before transmitting your personal data.

Company transfers: EZ93 reserves the right to transfer, either in whole or in part, your personal information in the event of the sale or transfer of our company or our assets. If the company is sold or transferred, EZ93 will give you the option of refusing to allow the transfer of your personal information. In some cases, this might mean that the new company can no longer provide you with the services or products that were previously provided by EZ93.

Legal execution: EZ93 can disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent for the following purposes: to comply with laws, ordinances or court decisions; to cooperate with investigations by public authorities; to prevent fraud; or to assert or protect the rights of EZ93.

Your consent: In all other cases, EZ93 will ask for your explicit consent before your personal information is disclosed to third parties.
