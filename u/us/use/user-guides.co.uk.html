<h2>User Guides (Numus Software Ltd) Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>We respect and are committed to protecting your 
    privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy 
    Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We 
    promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in 
    ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies 
    are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion lists and 
    opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by User Guides.co.uk 
    Limited, (“User Guides”). (The User Guides Network includes all Web sites and certain 
    other Internet media properties hyper linked from the User Guides home page.) The 
    following discloses our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>What information are 
    you collecting and how are you collecting it?</strong></p>
    <p>Every computer connected to the 
    Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that 
    computer's IP Address . When a visitor requests a page 
    from any Web site within the User Guides Network, our Web servers automatically 
    recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP 
    address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from 
    which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our 
    traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the User Guides Network, its 
    users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also Will you disclose 
    the information you collect to outside third parties? We do not collect 
    and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do 
    not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.</p>
    <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
    <p>From time to time, User Guides or its 
    advertisers may send a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your 
    Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
    A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files 
    created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use 
    cookies to identify which areas of User Guides's Network you have visited or 
    customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily 
    accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times 
    you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this 
    information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that 
    you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing 
    the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse 
    all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. 
    If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and 
    other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as 
    intended.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you use 
    single-pixel gifs? </strong></p>
    <p>User Guides and its advertisers 
    may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web 
    beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical 
    information. User Guides does not gather personal information through the use of 
    these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track 
    personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a 
    user's computer by an advertiser.</p>
    <p><strong>What information do you 
    collect when I register for something?</strong></p>
    <p>User Guides offers access to some 
    services that require registration. We may use your registration contact 
    information to send notification to you of User Guides products and services by 
    e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information with our 
    clients. Our clients may send you promotional material that is related to 
    the topic of the service for which you registered. We may also use your IP 
    address internally and share it with third parties. See <em>Will you disclose 
    the information that you collect to outside third parties?</em></p>
    <p><strong>What other information 
    do you request?</strong></p>
    <p>We may also request your 
    e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or 
    to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail 
    newsletters, announcement lists or information about conferences and trade 
    shows). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly 
    indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We 
    maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not sell, rent, or 
    otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent or 
    as permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We may from time to time 
    send e-mail announcing new User Guides products and services. Except as stated 
    above, User Guides will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. If 
    you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive 
    postal mailings from other third party companies.</p>
    <p>When you sign up for an 
    User Guides discussion forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes of 
    maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used 
    to monitor your activity within a forum, nor is it used to identify you 
    outside the User Guides network.</p>
    <p>When you register for a 
    contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail 
    address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.</p>
    <p>When you use co-branded 
    services, or those provided by a third party, within the User Guides Network, your 
    information may be passed to the co-brand or third party provider and their 
    use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.</p>
    <p><strong>What information do you 
    collect when I purchase something?</strong></p>
    <p>If you are purchasing 
    something from an User Guides media property, we and any third party provider, need 
    to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and 
    expiration date. This allows us, or third party providers, to process and 
    fulfil your order and to notify you of your order status. This information 
    may also be used by us to notify you of related products and services. 
    Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third 
    parties for any purpose except as provided in this Privacy Policy without 
    your express permission.</p>
    <p>Certain User Guides media 
    properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by 
    using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL 
    codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it 
    unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other User Guides media 
    properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to 
    transfer information.</p>
    <p>Wherever User Guides collects 
    personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy 
    Policy on that page.</p>
    <p><strong>Will you disclose the 
    information you collect to outside third parties?</strong></p>
    <p>User Guides will disclose 
    personal information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the 
    good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: </p>
    <p>1) Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful 
    activities and conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process 
    served on User Guides, </p>
    <p>2) Protect and 
    defend the rights or property of the User Guides Network of sites and related 
    properties, or visitors to the User Guides Network of sites and related properties,
    </p>
    <p>3) Identify 
    persons who may be violating the law, the User Guides legal notice and Web site 
    User Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the User Guides 
    Network or its related properties,</p>
    <p>4) Fulfil a 
    user's order or request.</p>
    <p>User Guides uses reasonable 
    precautions to keep the information disclosed to us secure. User Guides reserves 
    the right to transfer all such information in connection with the sale of 
    all or part of User Guides's capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not 
    responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third 
    parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such third 
    party privacy policies or how they treat information about their users<br>
    See below.</p>
    <p><strong>What else should I know 
    about my privacy when online?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The User Guides Network contains 
    many hyperlinks to third party Web sites. The User Guides Network also contains 
    advertisements of third parties. User Guides is not responsible for the privacy 
    practices or the content of such third party Web sites or advertisers. User Guides 
    does not share any of the individual personal information you provide User Guides 
    with the third parties to which User Guides links, except as stated elsewhere 
    within this Privacy Policy, although User Guides may share general, aggregate data 
    with such third parties (such as how many people use our site). Please check 
    with those Web sites to determine their privacy policy.</p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that 
    whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example 
    through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be 
    collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information 
    online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited 
    messages from other parties in return.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, you are solely 
    responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please 
    be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>
    <p><strong>Your Consent To This Agreement</strong></p>
    <p>By using the User Guides Network, 
    you consent to the collection and use of information by User Guides as specified 
    above. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
    on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, 
    how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
    <p>Please send any questions 
    about User Guides’s Privacy Policy to: <a href="mailto:privacy@user-guides.co.uk">
    privacy@user-guides.co.uk </a></p>
