This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from you, what we do with it, and how you can correct or change such information. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any personal data through the Site. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Site, or if you wish to unsubscribe from Site services for which you have previously registered, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@usanetwork.com">webmaster@usanetwork.com</a> or at the address at the end of this policy. <br><br>PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE <a href="/terms/index.html">TERMS OF USE</a> FOR THE SITE CAREFULLY.

<br><br><b>1. Types of Information Collected </b><br><br><b>Personal Data:</b> Personally Identifiable Information ("Personal Data") consists of information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address, phone number and credit card information. This Site collects Personal Data when you interact with the Site, for example when you register for electronic newsletters or other membership services such as chat rooms or message boards; participate in chat rooms, blogs or other user forums; respond to polls or surveys; purchase merchandise or subscribe to magazines via the Site; register for sweepstakes, contests and other promotional opportunities; or seek help from our customer service departments. We may also collect information when you purchase products or services offline, or register for wireless services via your cellphone or other wireless devices ("Other Services"). Because providing detailed information regarding our privacy policy when you register or provide information in connection with these Other Services often proves impractical, you may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us. We may also obtain Personal Data from reputable third parties, such as credit agencies. <br><br><b>Aggregate and Anonymous Data:</b> Aggregate and anonymous data is information collected automatically through the operation of the Site ("AA Data"). We may collect site usage data (such as which Site pages you visit and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses from individuals who visit the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from a website, its servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Data, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us and the Site. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version. During some visits, we may use software tools, such as Javascript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page. <br><br><b>2. Use of Cookies:</b> Like many sites, we use "cookies" to collect AA Data. A cookie is a small data file that writes to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit the Site. Cookies allow the Site to measure traffic activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, allowing you to visit "member only" portions of the Site without re-registering, and tracking the progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of the Site, such as shopping, contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. <br><br><b>3. Use of Web Beacons and Other Technologies</b>. We and our service providers may also use so-called "web beacons," "pixel tags," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Web Beacons") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Among other things, Web Beacons allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Web Beacons can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened. In addition, we may also use other software tools, such as Javascript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page. <br><br><b>4. Our Use of Your Data:</b> <br><br><b>Personal Data:</b> We will use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was provided. For example, if you provide Personal Data to register for a newsletter or a text messaging service, to enter a contest or to purchase goods or services, we will use it to register you for or provide you with those goods or services. We may also use your Personal Data to provide you with information about features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. We also may send information or offers to selected groups of Site users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that those businesses your name or address. . Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your Personal Data on the Site. We will notify you of this possibility when you provide the Personal Data and, if possible, when the Personal Data is posted. From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use your Personal Data to email to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving these administrative emails. <br><br><b>5.
