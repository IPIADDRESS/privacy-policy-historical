<p class="sectionHeading"><u>Types of Information We Collect</u></p>
<p class="fifteen">
When you visit the Website, "<u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>" (as defined below) is not
automatically collected. However, certain non-personal information (such as things like your IP

administer the Website, diagnose server failures, and generally enhance a Visitor's online
experience.
</p>
<p class="fifteen">
We will also collect certain information arising out of your use of the Website, such as Cookies, or
augment the data we collect with other information from other online or offline sources. We
reserve the right to collect information about you and store it in connection with other online or
offline information we may possess or obtain about you.
