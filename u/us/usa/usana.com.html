      </p><p>USANA respects the privacy of every individual who visits 
        our web site, and we are strongly committed to protecting their personal 
        information. Please take a moment to read the following policy statement 
        to understand how USANA collects, uses and safeguards the personal information 
        you provide to us on the website. This policy may change from time to 
        time, so please check back periodically. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>General Information about All USANA.COM Visitors</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As a visitor to USANA’s website, you are anonymous to 
        the company. Like many other commercial websites, USANA may use a standard 
        technology called a "cookie" that measures the number of visitors 
        to the different sections of the website. Cookies are designed, generally, 
        to collect and store the name of the domain from which you access the 
        Internet (e.g., aol.com, if you are connecting from an American Online 
        account), the date and time you access USANA’s site, and the Internet 
        address of the website from which you linked directly to USANA’s site. 
        USANA uses the information collected by cookies to improve its site and 
        make it more useful to visitors. USANA’s cookies do not collect personal 
        information. </p>
      <p><b>Information about You</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Sometimes USANA may ask you to provide specific information 
        about you when you sign up to use a service, like Downline Management, 
        or when you order a product online. In this case, USANA needs certain 
        information, such as name, internet and/or e-mail address, billing address, 
        shipping address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., in order 
        to provide that service or product to you. When obtaining information 
        from you, USANA will ask for only the information we need to provide the 
        service or product you have requested. You may rest assured that USANA 
        will never misuse the information you provide us. Moreover, USANA will 
        attempt to keep your information complete, up-to-date, and accurate. </p>
      <p><b>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Where permitted by applicable law, USANA may provide 
        your personal information to certain third parties. For example, USANA 
        may give your personal information to its authorized employees, directors, 
        and managers to help the company develop internal reports, plan and facilitate 
        meetings and training, and administer Distributor benefits. USANA may 
        also provide your personal information to agents, contractors, suppliers, 
        or vendors that offer administrative, advertising, printing, or other 
        services to USANA for the benefit of its Distributors. Examples of such 
        services include VOX voicemail, USANA One Long Distance, USANA Plus Credit 
        Card, and personalized USANA checks. Finally, USANA may disclose your 
        personal information to government agencies or regulatory authorities. 
        Of course, USANA will never reveal your personal information to any third 
        party without your prior knowledge and consent, unless the company is 
        required to do so by law. <u></u></p>
      <p><b>How to Contact USANA about Your Personal Information</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>If you wish to verify that the personal information USANA has about you 
        is correct or if you wish to have your name and/or e-mail address removed 
        from any lists maintained by the company, you may contact USANA’s Distributor 
        Service Department in writing at 3838 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake 
        City, Utah 84120-6336 or by e-mail message to <a href="mailto:dist.serv@us.usana.com">dist.serv@us.usana.com</a>. 
        USANA will promptly respond to your questions or requests and correct 
        any errors or inaccuracies in your personal information. </p>
