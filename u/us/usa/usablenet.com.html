               <p>UsableNet Inc. collects data from 
                  your IP address to help diagnose of your web pages or website. Your IP address 
                  is also used to gather broad demographic information about our audience which 
                  we use to improve the UsableNet Service, and deliver statistical information such 
                  as the Web Usability Index (WUI). UsableNet Inc. could issues cookies to users 
                  when they come to our Web site to allow us to learn how many unique visitors we 
                  have, to aid in analyzing navigation paths through our site, to grant discounts 
                  to visitors who elect to take part special promotions, and to maintain login information 
                  during a subscriber's session. Cookie tracking identifies you by using a unique 
                  number; personal information such as name and address are only correlated with 
                  cookie information to allow us to manage subscriber login sessions. Other companies 
                  which eventually place advertising on our site or that are part of the UsableNet

                  you are, and UsableNet Inc. will not deliver this information.

                  URL, email address and other site related informations. The URL is always required 
                  because our tool needs that information to know for which site to run a test. Due to the nature of our other services an email
                  address is required 
                  (for example to contact a user about a server problem). Personal data is never
