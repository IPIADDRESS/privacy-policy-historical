			  <h3>Usablenet Inc. Privacy Agreement</h3>

				The information that you submit on the Usablenet, Inc. website will
				be for internal use only. Usablenet will not release your personal
				data to any third parties without your consent.
				
				 <h3>Usage of Information gathered by Usablenet</h3>
				
				Usablenet collects data from your IP address to  your web
				pages or website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad
				demographic information about our audience which we use to improve
				Usablenet products and services, and deliver statistical information
				such as the Web Usability Index (WUI). Usablenet uses sometimes
				cookies to track users when they come to the website. This allows us
				to learn how many unique visitors we have, aid in analyzing navigation
				paths through our site, grant discounts to visitors who elect to take
				part in special promotions, and to maintain login information during a
				subscriber's session. Cookie tracking identifies visitors with a
				unique number; personal information such as name and address are only
				correlated with cookie information that allows us to manage subscriber
				login sessions. Other companies which eventually place advertising on
				our site or participate in the Usablenet Inc. affiliate program, also
				have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that
				Usablenet Inc. does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to
				identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not
				know who you are, and Usablenet Inc. will not disclose this
				information.
				
				 <h3>Free Service Users</h3>
				
				When using our free services, we have a form for users to enter
				their URL, e-mail address and other site-related information. The URL
				is always required because our tool needs this information in order to
				run a test on the website. Due to the nature of our other services, an
				e-mail address is also required (for example to contact a user about a
				server problem). Personal data is never released to any third
				party.
				
				 <h3>Subscription Users</h3>
				
				The Usablenet, Inc. registration form requires users requesting a
				product or service to provide their contact information (such as name,
				e-mail address, postal address etc.). We use this information to
				process the order, to e-mail information on the company (such as a
				promotional mailing on new services), and to contact the visitor when
				necessary. We do not collect the visitor's financial information (such
				as credit card numbers) via our website. Such information is directly
				communicated through a secure connection from the clients' browsers to
				the site of the organization processing the credit card
				transaction.
				
				<h3>For all Users</h3>
				
				Whether you are a free user or subscription user, you can be assured
				that if you provide information to Usablenet Inc., no individual data
				will be passed on to a third party. Usablenet Inc. will divulge
				information only if requested by state court and federal laws. On
				occasion, Usablenet Inc. conducts online surveys that ask visitors for
				contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic
				information. These surveys are conducted to determine better ways to
				support our customers. Survey results provide us information that
				enables us to better tailor our content to user needs and to help our
				advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics of our
				audience. No individual personal data will ever be released from these
				surveys. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our
				customers' needs. Usablenet Inc. may present information to our
				advertisers in the form of summary statistics compiling among all of
				our visitors' answers to survey questions as well as collective
				on-site behavior. This is to help our advertisers tailor the content
				of ads to the interests of our customers. At no time is individual
				data shared with anyone. The Usablenet site contains links to other
				sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
				of such websites. For this we advice you to read the privacy
				statements of linked websites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from
				that of Usablenet.
				
				<h3>Security</h3>
				
				This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
				misuse and alteration of your personal information. Access to computer
				data and files at Usablenet, Inc. are secured by firewalls and password
				coding to prevent unauthorized access. Usablenet utilizes
				industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card
				information during our online checkout process. SSL encryption is a
				method by which information transmitted across the internet is encoded
				to defeat theft by anyone who should intercept the data before it
				reaches its destination.  Our security and privacy policies are
				periodically updated and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized
				individuals have access to the information provided by our
				customers.<br>
				<br>
				
				All credit cards processing supported by Usablenet's site is
				implemented in a way that credit card numbers and data are not stored
				in Usablenet's database, but are directly passed (in a secure
				encrypted way) to a bank service that processes them. Therefore in the
				unlikely situation that third parties can get access to Usablenet's
				database, this information won't be available at all. For more details
				please read the Safe Transactions page.
				<h3>E-mail Management</h3>
				Usablenet keeps e-mail addresses in its own private database and does
				not use any other internet resources to collect them. When you receive
				an e-mail from Usablenet you will find an URL that lets you to
				unsubscribe to the news service. By doing so, your e-mail address will be
				marked in our database as "REMOVED", so that you will not receive any other
				unsolicited e-mails from any Usablenet services. If you want to re-subscribe your
				e-mail address, you need to send an e-mail to Usablenet customer support
				(<img src="/images/mail_support.gif" alt="mail support usablenet" width="136" height="13" border="0" align="texttop">),
				asking to reactivate your e-mail address. If you have used more than
				one e-mail address to operate Usablenet's website or tools, you'll
				need to mark each of these addresses in order to avoid receiving news messages.
