               <h2>USABLENET INC. PRIVACY AGREEMENT</h2>
               
               
               <p>The information you enter in UsableNet, Inc. website will be known
                  to only by you and UsableNet. UsableNet will not release your personal
                  data to anyone else without your consent.
               </p>
               
               
               <h2>USAGE OF INFORMATION GATHERED BY USABLENET</h2>
               
               
               <p>UsableNet collects data from your IP address to help diagnose your
                  web pages or website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad
                  demographic information about our audience which we use to improve
                  UsableNet products and services, and deliver statistical information
                  such as the Web Usability Index (WUI). UsableNet uses cookies to track
                  users when they come to our Web site. This allows us to learn how many
                  unique visitors we have, aid in analyzing navigation paths through our
                  site, grant discounts to visitors who elect to take part special
                  promotions, and to maintain login information during a subscriber's
                  session. Cookie tracking identifies visitors with a unique number;
                  personal information such as name and address are only correlated with
                  cookie information that allows us to manage subscriber login
                  sessions. Other companies which eventually place advertising on our
                  site or that are part of the UsableNet Inc. affiliate program, also
                  have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that
                  UsableNet Inc. does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to
                  identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not
                  know who you are, and UsableNet Inc. will not disclose this
                  information.
               </p>
               
               
               <h2>FREE SERVICE USERS</h2>
               
               
               <p>When using our free services, we have a form for users to enter
                  their URL, email address and other site-related information. The URL
                  is always required because our tool needs this information in order to
                  run a test on the website. Due to the nature of our other services an
                  email address is also required (for example to contact a user about a
                  server problem). Personal data is never released to any third
                  party.
               </p>
               
               
               <h2>SUBSCRIPTION USERS</h2>
               
               
               <p> The UsableNet, Inc. registration form requires users requesting a
                  product or service to provide their contact information (such as name,
                  email address, postal address etc.). We use this information to
                  process the order, to email information on the company (such as a
                  promotional mailing on new services), and to contact the visitor when
                  necessary. We do not collect the visitor's financial information (such
                  as credit card numbers) via our website. Such information is directly
                  communicated through a secure connection from clients' browsers to the
                  site of the institution processing the credit card transaction.
               </p>
               
               
               <h2>FOR ALL USERS</h2>
               
               
               <p>
                  Whether you are a free user or subscription user, you can be assured
                  that if you provide information to UsableNet Inc., no individual data
                  will passed on to a third party. UsableNet Inc. will divulge
                  information only if requested by state court and federal laws. On
                  occasion, UsableNet Inc. conducts online surveys that ask visitors for
                  contact information (like their email address) and demographic
                  information. These surveys are conducted to determine better ways to
                  support our customers. Survey results provide us information that
                  enables us to better tailor our content to user needs and to help our
                  advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics of our
                  audience. No individual personal data will ever be released from these
                  surveys. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our
                  customers' needs. UsableNet Inc. may present information to our
                  advertisers in the form of summative statistics compiling among all of
                  our visitors' answers to survey questions as well as collective
                  on-site behavior. This is to help our advertisers tailor the content
                  of ads to the interests of our customers. At no time is individual
                  data shared with anyone. The UsableNet site contains links to other
                  sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content

                  statements of linked websites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from
                  that of UsableNet.
