<h2>UsableNet Inc. Privacy Agreement</h2>

<p>The information that you submit on the UsableNet, Inc. website will
be for internal use only. UsableNet will not release your personal
data to any third parties without your consent.</p>

<h2>Usage of Information gathered by UsableNet</h2>

<p>UsableNet collects data from your IP address to diagnose your web
pages or website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad
demographic information about our audience which we use to improve
UsableNet products and services, and deliver statistical information
such as the Web Usability Index (WUI). UsableNet uses sometimes
cookies to track users when they come to the website. This allows us
to learn how many unique visitors we have, aid in analyzing navigation
paths through our site, grant discounts to visitors who elect to take
part in special promotions, and to maintain login information during a
subscriber's session. Cookie tracking identifies visitors with a
unique number; personal information such as name and address are only
correlated with cookie information that allows us to manage subscriber
login sessions. Other companies which eventually place advertising on
our site or participate in the UsableNet Inc. affiliate program, also
have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that
UsableNet Inc. does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to
identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not
know who you are, and UsableNet Inc. will not disclose this
information.</p>

<h2>Free Service Users</h2>

<p>When using our free services, we have a form for users to enter
their URL, e-mail address and other site-related information. The URL
is always required because our tool needs this information in order to
run a test on the website. Due to the nature of our other services, an
e-mail address is also required (for example to contact a user about a
server problem). Personal data is never released to any third
party.</p>

<h2>Subscription Users</h2>

<p> The UsableNet, Inc. registration form requires users requesting a
product or service to provide their contact information (such as name,
e-mail address, postal address etc.). We use this information to
process the order, to e-mail information on the company (such as a
promotional mailing on new services), and to contact the visitor when
necessary. We do not collect the visitor's financial information (such
as credit card numbers) via our website. Such information is directly
communicated through a secure connection from the clients' browsers to
the site of the organization processing the credit card
transaction.</p>

<h2>For all Users</h2>

<p>
Whether you are a free user or subscription user, you can be assured
that if you provide information to UsableNet Inc., no individual data
will be passed on to a third party. UsableNet Inc. will divulge
information only if requested by state court and federal laws. On
occasion, UsableNet Inc. conducts online surveys that ask visitors for
contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic
information. These surveys are conducted to determine better ways to
support our customers. Survey results provide us information that
enables us to better tailor our content to user needs and to help our
advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics of our
audience. No individual personal data will ever be released from these
surveys. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our
customers' needs. UsableNet Inc. may present information to our
advertisers in the form of summary statistics compiling among all of
our visitors' answers to survey questions as well as collective
on-site behavior. This is to help our advertisers tailor the content
of ads to the interests of our customers. At no time is individual
data shared with anyone. The UsableNet site contains links to other
sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
of such websites. For this we advice you to read the privacy
statements of linked websites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from
that of UsableNet.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p> This site has security measures in place to protect the loss,
misuse and alteration of your personal information. Access to computer
data and files at UsableNet, Inc. are secured by firewalls and password
coding to prevent unauthorized access. UsableNet utilizes
industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card
information during our online checkout process. SSL encryption is a
method by which information transmitted across the internet is encoded
to defeat theft by anyone who should intercept the data before it
reaches its destination.  Our security and privacy policies are
periodically updated and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized
individuals have access to the information provided by our
customers.</p>

<p>
All credit cards processing supported by UsableNet's site is
implemented in a way that credit card numbers and data are not stored
in UsableNet's database, but are directly passed (in a secure
encrypted way) to a bank service that processes them. Therefore in the
unlikely situation that third parties can get access to UsableNet's
database, this information won't be available at all. For more details
please read the <a href="safe_transaction.html">Safe Transactions</a> page.
</p>

<h2>E-mail Management</h2>
<p>
UsableNet keeps e-mail addresses in its own private database and does
not use any other internet resources to collect them. When you receive
an e-mail from UsableNet you will find an URL that lets you to
unsubscribe to the news service. By doing so, your e-mail address will be
marked in our database as "REMOVED", so that you will not receive any other
unsolicited e-mails from any UsableNet services. If you want to re-subscribe your
e-mail address, you need to send an e-mail to UsableNet customer support
(<a href="mailto:support@usablenet.com">support@usablenet.com</a>),
asking to reactivate your e-mail address. If you have used more than
one e-mail address to operate UsableNet's website or tools, you'll
need to mark each of these addresses in order to avoid receiving news messages.
