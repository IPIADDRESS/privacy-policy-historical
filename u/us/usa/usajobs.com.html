                                        to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best 
                                        efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us is used only for the purposes as set forth herein. </p>
                                    <p><b>Aggregated Data About USAJOBS.com Visitors </b><br>
                                        In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently. 
                                        We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us to determine what is most beneficial 
                                        for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information 
                                        with third parties, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how USAJOBS.com visitors use our 
                                        site, so they may create a better overall experience for you as well. </p>
                                    <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information </b><br>
                                        USAJOBS.com collects personally identifiable information from users when you register for a USAJOBS account, when 
                                        you use certain products or services and when you enter promotions or contests. We may also ask you for other information, 
                                        such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested 
                                        in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience. <br>
                                        If you give us permission, we may use that information to contact you about new site feature announcements, Career 
                                        events, enhancements and general updates. USAJOBS.com also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these 
                                        types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but 
                                        later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the instructions in the e-mail to opt-out. <br>
                                        All users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their e-mail 
                                        address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages form third

                                        number, personal references, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe, in good faith, that such release 
                                        is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or
