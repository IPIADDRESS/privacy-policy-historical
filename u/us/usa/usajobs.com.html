				<tr>
					<td><font size="2">
					We at USAJOBS.com understand your need to maintain your privacy when searching for a job. USAJOBS.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us is used only for the purposes as set forth herein.
					<br><br>
					<b>Aggregated Data About USAJOBS.com Visitors</b>
					<br>In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us to determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information with third parties, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how USAJOBS.com visitors use our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you as well.
					<br><br>
					<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>
					<br>USAJOBS.com collects personally identifiable information from users when you register for a USAJOBS account, when you use certain products or services and when you enter promotions or contests. We may also ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the site, the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best possible site experience.
					<br>If you give us permission, we may use that information to contact you about new site feature announcements, Career events, enhancements and general updates. USAJOBS.com also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the instructions in the e-mail to opt-out.
					<br>All users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their e-mail address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages form third parties, for which USAJOBS.com is not responsible.

					<br><br>
					<b>Internet Protocol Address</b>

					<br>Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not disclose information about your individual visits to our site, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, personal references, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of USAJOBS.com, our users, or others. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners, member companies and job seekers. Also, if you input your information on a co-branded page, then your information becomes the property of both USAJOBS.com and the co-sponsor of the page. In that instance, the use of your personal information by our partner company will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and USAJOBS.com is not responsible for the same.

Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These other companies may have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any third party.

However, employers and recruiters who have paid for access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database.
					<br><br>Agencies, headhunters and third party staffing agencies have the ability to post jobs on our site, but they are not given access to our resume database.
