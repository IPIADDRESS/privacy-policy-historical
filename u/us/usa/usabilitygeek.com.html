Session cookies also permit users to be recognized as they navigate a website so that any item or page changes they make are remembered from page to page. Session cookies expire after a browser session; thus, they are not stored long term.</p>
<h4>Persistent Cookies</h4>

<h4>Web Beacons</h4>
<p>We may also use a technology called web beacons to collect general information about your use of our website and your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information we collect by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor the number of people who open our emails. Web beacons also help us to understand the behavior of our customers, members, and visitors.</p>
<h4>Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Notice</h4>
<p>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a userâs past visits to our website. Googleâs use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visits to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> For European users visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a></p>
<h4>Google Analytics Privacy Notice</h4>
<p>Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our products and services to users, improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. We have enabled Google Analytics advertising features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects only an anonymized version of the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website. For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a></p>
<p>You can prevent Google Analytics from using your information by opting out at this link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>
<h4>Google Remarketing</h4>
<p>Why am I seeing ads by Google for products Iâve viewed?</p>
<p>Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The websiteâs owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes. For this to happen, Google will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. You can opt out of Googleâs use of cookies and remarketing at this link: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a> or you can opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at: <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</a></p>
<h4>Gravatar Disclosure</h4>
<p>We use a service from <a href="http://www.en.gravatar.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.en.gravatar.com</a> that allows you to have an image that represents you if you are registered as a member with our website. It is a picture that appears next to your name in the author biography section wherever an article you have written for us is displayed. You have full control over what this image shows through Gravatarâs website and you can alter it at any time. This same image is shown when you interact with different websites that are Gravatar-enabled. To make this happen, a tracking mechanism is used that may follow you from website to website.</p>

While we are not legally liable for the actions of our users, we will remove any postings about which we are notified, if such postings violate the privacy rights of others.</p>
<h2>Do Not Track Settings</h2>
<p>Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that our website not track your movement within our website. Our website does not obey such settings when transmitted to and detected by our website. You can turn off tracking features and other security settings in your browser by referring to your browserâs user manual.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites. These websites are not under our control and are not subject to our privacy notice. These websites will likely have their own privacy notices. We have no responsibility for these websites and we provide links to these websites solely for your convenience. You acknowledge that your use of and access to these websites are solely at your risk. It is your responsibility to check the privacy notices of these websites to see how they treat your Personal Data.</p>
<h2>Protecting Childrenâs Privacy</h2>
<p>Even though our website is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 16, we realize that a child under the age of 16 may attempt to access our website. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our website, please contact us. Before we remove any information, we may ask for proof of identification to prevent malicious removal of account information.

You acknowledge that we do not verify the age of our users nor do we have any liability to do so.</p>
<h2>Our Email Policy</h2>

<h2>Our Security Policy</h2>
<p>We have built our website using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your Personal Data.

<h2>Transferring Personal Data From the European Union</h2>
<p>Personal Data that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which we operate, more specifically Denmark and the United States. The European Union has not found the United States and some other countries to have an adequate level of protection of Personal Data under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR for the transfer of data outside the European Union. For European Union customers and users, with your consent, your Personal Data may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States and/or other countries. We will use your Personal Data to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your Personal Data, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your Personal Data described within this section.</p>

If at any time we decide to disclose or use your Personal Data in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our usersâ and customersâ Personal Data in agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
