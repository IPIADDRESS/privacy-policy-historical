<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When an individual visits the U.S. 
  Naval institute website, our web server automatically logs the domain name of 
  the visitor's Internet service provider, but not the individual's e-mail address. 
  There is no information stored in our server logs that would allow us to identify 
  visitors to our site. We do not utilize "cookies"; that is, except 
  for the web pages cached by your browser, our server does not write any information 
  to any storage device attached to your personal computer, nor does it retrieve 
  any information previously stored on your personal computer. If you use our 
  secure online server to order merchandise, we ask that you submit the minimal 
  amount of information needed to process the order: your name, shipping address, 
  telephone number, credit-card number, and e-mail address. This information is 
  encrypted via transit over the Internet. Once it arrives at our server, which 
  is protected behind an Internet "firewall," it is forwarded immediately 
  to our customer-service department for processing and deleted from our server. 
  We use this information in order to contact you should a problem arise with 
  your order. We do not use this information to promote other products or services 
  to you. Should we, in the future, decide to use information collected during 
  the ordering process to promote the U.S. Naval Institute or Naval Institute 
  publications or products, we will state so clearly on all order forms. The customer 
  will always have the option to request that his or her information be excluded 
  from any such use. This option will be made available via a check-box or similar 
  device prominently located on all order forms. All such requests will be honored. 
  We will never provide any information collected during the purchasing process 
  to any third party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When an individual elects to join 
  the Naval Institute using our secure online membership form, additional information 
  is collected in order to help us better meet the needs of our membership community. 
  This information is also encrypted via transit over the Internet, and immediately 
  forwarded to our membership department upon arrival at our protected server. 
  If you have questions about how information supplied during membership submission 
  is utilized, please <a href="mailto:nkunkel@usni.org?subject=Questions%20About%20Information%20Supplied%20During%20Membership%20Submission">e-mail</a>
