                                <h3>SCOPE</h3>
                                <p>This Privacy Statement explains our practices about collecting, using and sharing personal information. It applies to U.S. Cellular and any Affiliate with whom we share and collect information. "Affiliate" refers to any of the Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. owned family of companies. The Privacy Statement also applies to "Third Parties" whom we require to maintain appropriate privacy and data security measures consistent with this Privacy Statement when we share your information as described in this Privacy Statement. We use "Third Parties" to refer to agents, vendors, suppliers, subcontractors, and independent contractors with whom we have a business relationship.</p>
                                <p>You authorize U.S. Cellular to collect your information when you interact with us. By subscribing to, accessing or using our products, services, applications and websites ("Services"), you agree to our collection, use and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Statement. Our Services include wireless services that provide voice, text, and picture messaging; internet access services; data services, such as vehicle and security monitoring; fixed wireless services; websites; and mobile applications.</p>
                                <p>Some products and services which are branded U.S. Cellular or co-branded with a Third Party may have a stand-alone privacy statement. When a different privacy statement applies, U.S. Cellular will provide you an opportunity to review the applicable terms of service and privacy statement.</p>
                                <p>When you purchase or use products or services not provided by U.S. Cellular, you are subject to the privacy statement provided by the third party supplier. For example, while using your U.S. Cellular device, you may:</p>
                                <ul class="bullet">
                                    <li>Access a Wi-Fi network not provided by U.S. Cellular.</li>
                                    <li>Download, purchase or use applications not provided by U.S. Cellular.</li>
                                    <li>Post on social media.</li>
                                    <li>Purchase from an online retailer.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>U.S. Cellular is not responsible for the data practices of those third parties.</p>

Please periodically refer back to the Privacy Statement to learn what changes, if any, have been made based on the effective date posted with the updated Privacy Statement. If we propose to use your information materially different than what was stated in the Privacy Statement at the time we collected it, U.S. Cellular will obtain your consent in the appropriate manner, which may include an opt-out mechanism.</p>

                                <h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h3>
                                <p><u>Personal Information</u>. Personal Information is any information that identifies and is associated with you directly, or can reasonably be used to identify you. Personal Information may include name, physical and email addresses, telephone numbers, date of birth, Social Security Numbers, Driver's License Numbers, credit card or financial account information, voice recordings or Customer Proprietary Network Information ("CPNI"). Personal Information does not include anonymous or <a href="#deidentified">de-identified information</a> that cannot personally identify you, your account or device.</p>
                                <p><u>Customer Proprietary Network Information</u>. CPNI is a special type of Personal Information that relates to and includes information that we have about you because of the wireless services we provide to you. Please refer to our section on <a href="#new-cpni">CPNI</a>.</p>
                                <p><u>Network and Device Information</u>. Network and device information is collected when you use our Services. Certain information such as Advertising IDs and persistent device identifiers indirectly may identify you or your device. Device identifiers include Electronic Serial Numbers (ESN) and mobile equipment identifiers (MEID) which are static numbers linked to a device. Advertising IDs are randomly generated codes on a mobile device that may be changed by the user. This type of information may help identify the same user across multiple devices or channels.

U.S. Cellular uses a variety of commercially reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect information residing on its systems from unauthorized access or disclosure including, without limitation, server firewalls and physical facility security.</p>

These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

                                <h3>Controlling Unsolicited Text Messages and E-mail ("Spam")</h3>
                                <p>U.S. Cellular is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial text messages and e-mail or "spam." Although U.S. Cellular continues to actively review and implement new technology to help prevent these activities, there is no currently available technology that will permit U.S. Cellular to totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited text messages or e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online may help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive.
