            <br>

	    <br>

	    <b>Collection of Information from Our Clients</b>

	    <br>

	    <br>

In order to process your order, we need to know some standard information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and telephone number. We also ask for a username and password that allow you to access your account information in USCitizenship.info secure online environment. It is our policy that the information you provide is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information. When you submit an order, your order information is encrypted with secure server software to protect the information from unauthorized access. Your credit card information and password for accessing your online account remain encrypted within our database. 

            <br>

	    <br>

Additionally, USCitizenship.info will not sell, rent, or trade any personal information you provide during ordering. 

	    <br>

	    <br>

	    <b>E-mail Updates and Newsletter</b>

	    <br>

	    <br>

USCitizenship.info may occasionally notify you of new services and special offers via e-mail updates. If you would rather not receive any updates from us, please send a request to be removed from our e-mail update list to cs@uscitizenship.info 

	    <br>

	    <br>

	    <b>Identifiable Information</b>

	    <br>

	    <br>

Our computer is not set up to track, collect, or distribute personal information about our web site visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses, or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. When visitors type information into our online order form, but do not complete the order process, that information is temporarily stored in our database. 

	    <br>

	    <br>

Solely for purposes of confirming valid traffic from certain pay per click search engines, IP addresses for these visitors are monitored, and may be compared to the records of that search engine.	    

	    <br>

	    <br>

In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and from which countries those requests come. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
