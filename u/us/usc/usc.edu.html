This policy applies to information that is collected by any means whether electronically, by telephone, or on paper.</p>
<h4>Limits on Use and Access</h4>
<p>The responsible use of personal information requires that the university respect individual privacy, protect against identity theft and other unauthorized uses, and comply fully with all laws and government regulations i n the collection, use, storage, display, distribution and disposal of such information.

The University will continue to collect and maintain Social Security numbers in all instances in which that number is required by law for reporting or other uses. This includes, but is not limited to, all enrolled students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and all individuals receiving payment from the University. In addition, the University will continue to use Social Security numbers, as allowed bylaw, for operational purposes for which there is no reasonable substitute. Social Security numbers are always considered confidential, and therefore subject to the access restrictions described above.</p>

<li>Publicly post or display the Social Security number in any manner;</li>

<li>Require an individual to use his or her Social Security number to access an Internet site unless a unique password or PIN is also required; or</li>
<li>Print a Social Security number on any materials that are mailed unless required by a state or federal agency, unless state or federal law requires the Social Security number to be on the document to be mailed. Also, Social Security numbers may be included in applications and forms sent by mail, including documents sent as part of an application or enrollment process, or to establish, amend or terminate an account, contract or policy, or to confirm the accuracy of the Social Security number.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Department and Personal Responsibility</h4>
<p>Each university department is responsible for reviewing and monitoring internal procedures, reports and other documents to assure compliance with this policy. This responsibility includes providing training and control systems for the responsible use of personal information that is accessible to employees for doing the work of the department. The University expects that all members of the community also will exercise caution in making available their own personal information to others. In particular, individuals should not give others access to their USC identification cards, passwords or personal identification number (PIN).</p>

Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on the USC Web site.</p>
