USJobResource, LLC (“us,” “we,” or   “Company”) is   committed to respecting the privacy rights of its   customers, visitors,   and other users of the Company Website (the   “Site”) pursuant to the   terms contained herein. We created this   USJobResource.com Privacy Policy   (this “Policy”) to give you notice of   how your private information will   be used as a result of submitting   it to our Company. This Policy is   only applicable to the Site, and not   to any other websites that you may   be able to access from the Site,   each of which may have data collection   and use practices and policies   that differ materially from this Policy.</p>
  <p>1.2   NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN. We are a general audience site,   and do not   direct any of our content specifically at children under 13   years of   age. We understand and are committed to respecting the   sensitive nature   of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have   reason to suspect that   a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly   delete any personal   information in that user’s account.</p>
  <p>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>

No personal information about you is   revealed in this   process. The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic   data” that does not   personally identify you, but that may be helpful   for marketing purposes   or for improving the services we offer.</p>
