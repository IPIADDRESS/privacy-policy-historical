        OF SOUTH FLORIDA INTERNET PRIVACY POLICY </font> </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you 
        for visiting the University of South Florida home page. Your privacy is 
        very important to us. Simply stated, our policy for official USF websites 
        is to collect no personal information about you when you visit an official 
        USF website unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available 
        to us.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you 
        visit official USF websites, our Web servers automatically recognize only 
        the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed that website, 
        and keep track of the types of operating systems, screen resolutions, 
        and other hardware related items that help us make our site more accessible. 
        This information does not result in the identification of your personal 
        e-mail address or other personal information. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, 
        we may gather information regarding the volume and timing of access to 
        our websites by collecting information on the date, time and website pages 
        accessed by visitors to the website. We do this so that we can improve 
        the content of our website and this information is not shared with other 
        organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and individual 
        visitor's personal information is not identified.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you choose 
        to share information with us - by sending us a message or filling out 
        an electronic form with personal information - we will use the information 
        only for the purposes you authorized. Some of the information may be saved 
        for a designated period of time to comply with Florida's archiving policies, 
        but we will not disclose the information to third parties or other government 
        agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law or by your 
        specific permission.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please be 
        aware that as a large University with over 45,000 students, faculty and 
        staff, there are many websites within the USF.edu domain. This policy 
        relates to those websites on which the University conducts its official 
        business. Because we encourage the development and deployment of technology 
        in an environment of academic freedom, we cannot ensure that all websites 
        within the USF.edu domain are in strict compliance with this policy at 
        all times.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have 
        other questions about our privacy policy, or have ideas about improving 
        our policies, please feel free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:www@usf.edu">www@usf.edu</a> 
        or by telephone at (813)974-9624.</font></p>
