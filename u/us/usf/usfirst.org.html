<p>We, at <em>FIRST,</em> take privacy and security of personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for <em>FIRST</em> (“<em>FIRST</em>”, “Our”, “We”, “Us”) its web site <a title="www.usfirst.org" href="/"><u>www.usfirst.org</u></a> and various related services (together referred to as the “Site”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants and parents, and other persons entering any <em>FIRST</em> online system or database understand and agree to the following terms:<br><br></p>
<p><strong><u>Youth under 13 (COPPA Compliancy)</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, you need your parent’s permission to use this site (which throughout this Policy&nbsp;refers to all <em>FIRST</em> websites) at all, and, unless we receive your parent’s verifiable consent (e.g. initials on your on-line registration&nbsp;form or an email from your parents to the <em>FIRST</em> Webmaster) before you can enter any personal information (such as name, address, email address, pictures of yourself) in any of our online systems.</p>
<p>You may not enter personal information (such as name, address, email address) in any of our online systems.</p>
<p>If we learn that we have information from a child under 13 without the required parental consent, we will delete that information as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Youth 13 - 18</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are 13 to 18 years of age we expect you to have your parent’s permission before participating on this site, and particularly before submitting any pictures or personal information about yourself.</p>
<p><u><strong>Terms of the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Policy</strong></u></p>
<p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of Our Site Terms of Use, and by accessing or using Our Site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this Site.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions, or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited, to issuing an e-mail to the e-mail address listed by registered users and posting the revised Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user, review this Site and this Policy periodically, and to be aware of any modifications.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Site after any such modifications will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of any modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by any modified Policy.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Types of Information Collected</strong></p>
<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) to facilitate the operation, funding, and management of <em>FIRST</em> programs. We do not rent or sell this information to others. We may share your information with partners or others who are acting on our behalf to help conduct <em>FIRST</em> programs. We hold them to the same standards of privacy and security as we hold our own staff.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp; This refers to information that lets Us know the specifics of who you are.&nbsp; It includes personal information, such as your first and last name, title, mailing address (including zip code),email address,&nbsp;age, team affiliation, phone number and, to facilitate certain transactions, credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for a an event, ordering a subscription to Our newsletter, ordering products (e.g. the <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;LEGO League mission mat), submitting content and/or posting content in forums on forums.us<em>FIRST</em>.org or other public areas, filling out a survey, or sending Us feedback, we may ask you to provide PII by filling out and submitting an online form. Depending upon the activity, some of the information We ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.&nbsp;If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”):&nbsp; This refers to information that does not by itself identify any specific person. This includes the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. (A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.&nbsp; An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web.&nbsp;Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer.&nbsp; Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.) For information on cookies, see section 7 below.</p>
<p>We gather Non-PII at different places on Our Web Site in several ways.&nbsp;This information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual (anonymous) and an aggregated basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Collection Methods and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>We only collect PII when you have contacted Us in any manner.&nbsp;You provide certain PII to Us when you (a) register for an event; (b) subscribe to Our newsletter; (c) send e-mail messages, submit forms, or transmit other information by telephone or letter, (d) order products, (e) submit your credit card or other payment information; and (f) at other points on Our Site that state that such information is being collected.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;We or entities that provide direct service to Us collect Non-PII it may be used to diagnose problems with Our servers, software, to administer Our Site, and to gather demographic information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will primarily use your PII to provide Our services to you, as required by Our agreements with you. We will also use PII to analyze and enhance the operation of Our Site, fill orders, improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve Our product and service offerings, gather information, and customize Our Site’s content, layout, and services often with the assistance of Our vendors.&nbsp;We may use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices.&nbsp; We may also use PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce Our agreements with you, including Our Site Terms of Use, Sales Terms and Conditions, and this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;For information on cookies, see section 7 below.</p>
<p>By entering personal information into <em>FIRST</em> online systems, you agree to allow <em>FIRST</em> to collect, use, and disclose the information for the management of <em>FIRST</em> programs and efforts, as well as to communicate with you about <em>FIRST</em> programs and efforts. <em>FIRST</em> sometimes uses vendors to help manage programs, efforts, and communications, and such vendors will have temporary access to this information strictly for the conduct of <em>FIRST</em> programs or activities under the same standards of privacy and security as <em>FIRST</em> staff. <em>FIRST</em> systems are designed to support our policy that participants and parents should be the only people to modify the information we keep on them. The collection and use of this information is overseen by the <em>FIRST</em> Information Technology Manager.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Release of Information</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell, or rent your PII to others. We may provide some of program components through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners, and other third parties.&nbsp;We and Our service partners use your PII to operate Our Sites, to complete transactions you request, and to deliver their services. For example, We must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this Site; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help Us provide customer service.</p>
<p>Our service partners adopt and post their own privacy policies.&nbsp;The use of your PII by Our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners and is not subject to Our control.</p>
<p>Occasionally, We may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide PII to the appropriate governmental authorities.&nbsp;We will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order or subpoena or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.&nbsp;We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use Our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that We in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Updating and Correcting Information</strong></p>
<p><em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;participants have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to Us.&nbsp;PII may be changed in our various registration and communication systems or by requests in writing at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em><br>&nbsp;200 Bedford St.<br>&nbsp;Manchester, NH&nbsp;&nbsp;03101<br>&nbsp;(603) 666-3906&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customerservice@usFIRST.org">customerservice@us<em>FIRST</em>.org</a></p>
<p>Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact Us.</p>
<p>We encourage&nbsp;you to promptly update your PII if it ever changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because We keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Site.&nbsp;In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>We may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding Our programs and services.&nbsp;In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from Us and Our partners, We may occasionally send you direct mail about programs and services that We feel may be of interest to you. Only <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;(or permitted agents working on behalf of <em>FIRST</em> and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell Us when you give Us your personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you generally have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.&nbsp;If you choose to reject all cookies, some parts of Our Site may not work properly.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;Security of Information</strong></p>
<p>At Our Site, you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards.&nbsp;The importance of security for all PII associated with Our users is of utmost concern to Us.&nbsp;Your PII is protected in several ways.&nbsp;Access to <em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;participant PII is available through a unique customer ID and password selected by the participant.&nbsp;This password is encrypted.&nbsp;We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.&nbsp;In addition, your PII resides on a secure server that only selected <em>FIRST</em> personnel and contractors have access to via password. Participants may opt to display their PII in Volunteer, Team Contact, or forum areas of the Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. For security, this information is encrypted during communication.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp;As a result, while We strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond Our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and Us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;Cookies</strong></p>
<p>When you use Our Site, We may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of Our Site.&nbsp;A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to Us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your log-in name to welcome you back to Our Site.&nbsp;Our cookies (i) make your use of the Site easier, (ii) make the Site run more smoothly, (iii) track authenticated users visiting Our Site, and (iv) help Us to maintain a secure Site.&nbsp;You are always free to decline Our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of Our Site may not work properly in that case.&nbsp; Once you leave Our Web site and close your browser, the “cookie” disappears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although we do not do so presently, We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on Our Site.&nbsp;As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your computer.&nbsp; We will not provide any third-party ad server with any of your PII or information about your purchases.&nbsp;We and Our third-party ad server will collect and use Non-PII about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular ad.&nbsp; Other advertisers may also place banner ads on Our Site in the same manner as above, but We will not disclose any PII to them.</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp;Privacy Policies of Third-Party Sites</strong></p>
<p>As a public service, We may maintain links to other Web sites.&nbsp;Links to sponsoring organizations are an example of these links. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information We collect from you.&nbsp;Other sites accessible through Our Site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices.&nbsp;Please consult each site’s privacy policy.&nbsp;We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
<p>We welcome links to any part of Our Site from other nonprofits, government agencies, and others who wish to help extend our mission. We ask that you contact us to let us know of your intentions to link to our site, and indicate the purpose of the link. No link may present or display a product or activity in a way that states or implies the <em>FIRST</em>'s endorsement. <em>FIRST</em> does not endorse any commercial organizations, candidates for elected office, or products.</p>
<p><em>FIRST</em>'s Web site features links to other organization sites including those of Our corporate sponsors. We do not routinely "out-link" to private, commercial or other similar Web sites, other than current corporate sponsors of the <em>FIRST</em>’s programs and services. However, on a case-by-case basis, we will consider requests from such groups or persons to out-link to their Web sites. <em>FIRST</em> will grant such requests only where it is determined that such links will clearly support our mission and where we have concluded that such links will not in any way jeopardize our reputation, independence, objectivity, or mission.</p>
<p>From time to time, the <em>FIRST</em>, also, may decide on its own, not based on any request, to out-link to private, commercial or other Web sites. The same criteria described above will apply. Such links may be short or long-term, at the discretion of the organization.</p>
