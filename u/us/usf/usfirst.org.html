Participants may opt to display their PII in Volunteer, Team Contact, or forum areas of the Site.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions.&nbsp; They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. For security, this information is encrypted during communication.</p><p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; As a result, while We strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond Our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and Us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Cookies</strong></p><p>When you use Our Site, We will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of Our Site.&nbsp; A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to Us.&nbsp; Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your log-in name to welcome you back to Our Site.&nbsp; Our cookies (i) make your use of the Site easier, (ii) make the Site run more smoothly, (iii) track authenticated users visiting Our Site, and (iv) help Us to maintain a secure Site.&nbsp; You are always free to decline Our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of Our Site may not work properly in that case.&nbsp; Once you leave Our Web site and close your browser, the “cookie” disappears.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Although we do not do so presently, We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on Our Site.&nbsp; As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your computer.&nbsp; We will not provide any third-party ad server with any of your PII or information about your purchases.&nbsp; We and Our third-party ad server will collect and use Non-PII about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular ad.&nbsp; Other advertisers may also place banner ads on Our Site in the same manner as above, but We will not disclose any PII to them.</p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;Privacy Policies of Third-Party Sites</strong></p><p>As a public service, We may maintain links to other Web sites.&nbsp; Links to sponsoring organizations are an example of these links.

We ask that you contact us to let us know of your intentions to link to our site, and indicate the purpose of the link. No link may present or display a product or activity in a way that states or implies the <i>FIRST</i>'s endorsement. <i>FIRST</i> does not endorse any commercial organizations, candidates for elected office, or products.</p><p><i>FIRST</i>'s Web site features links to other organization sites including those of Our corporate sponsors. We do not routinely "out-link" to private, commercial or other similar Web sites, other than current corporate sponsors of the <i>FIRST</i>’s programs and services. However, on a case-by-case basis, we will consider requests from such groups or persons to out-link to their Web sites. <i>FIRST</i> will grant such requests only where it is determined that such links will clearly support our mission and where we have concluded that such links will not in any way jeopardize our reputation, independence, objectivity, or mission.</p><p>From time to time, the <i>FIRST</i>, also, may decide on its own, not based on any request, to out-link to private, commercial or other Web sites. The same criteria described above will apply. Such links may be short or long-term, at the discretion of the organization.</p><p><strong>9.&nbsp;Privacy Policy and Use of Our Training Library &amp; Forums</strong></p><p>&nbsp;For the educational use of Our members, <i>FIRST</i>&nbsp;offers an online Training Library with Worchester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) containing <i>FIRST</i> original and copyright-protected original works.&nbsp; It, also, maintains forums where training materials are posted. <i>FIRST</i> does not provide the service of registering copyrighted works with the Library of Congress, Copyright Division.&nbsp; Participants who post materials in Our Library and Forums are responsible for their own copyright recordations and legal claims.&nbsp; The comments and opinions expressed in postings to Library and Forums are solely of each individual author and in no way are shared by the <i>FIRST</i>.&nbsp; Users of Our Library and Forums, acknowledge and agree at all times to abide by legal protections and a professional honor system.&nbsp; Specifically, users acknowledge and affirm that in downloading, using or referring to the contents of any document included therein--whether in writing or verbally—they will make a full attribution to the author.</p><p><strong>10.&nbsp;Miscellaneous Privacy Issues</strong></p><p>You must be at least 18 years old to have Our permission to use this Site.&nbsp;Our policy is that We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII about visitors that are under 18 years of age.</p><p>You should also be aware that when PII is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, e-mail address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on this Site, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties.&nbsp; Such activities are beyond Our control and this Policy does not apply to such information.&nbsp; Any submissions to discussion forums or other public areas on this Site are accepted with the understanding that they are accessible to all third parties.&nbsp; If you do not want your comments to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any submissions.&nbsp; Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or account information.&nbsp; Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site, or your dealings with this Site, please contact Us via our <a title="Contact Us" href="/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=866">Contact Us</a> page or by sending a letter to:</p><p>&nbsp;<i>FIRST</i><br>
