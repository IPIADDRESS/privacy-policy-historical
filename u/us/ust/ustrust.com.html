              This policy covers Customer Information, which means personally identifiable information
              about a consumer or a consumer’s current or former customer relationship with Bank
              of America. This policy is provided to you as required by the Federal Financial
              Privacy Law* and applies to our companies identified in Section 8, Bank of America

              <b>1. Making the security of information a priority</b>
          </p>
          <p>
              Keeping financial information secure is one of our most important responsibilities.
              We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect Customer Information.
              Appropriate employees are authorized to access Customer Information for business
              purposes only. Our employees are bound by a code of ethics that requires confidential
              treatment of Customer Information and are subject to disciplinary action if they
              fail to follow this code.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>2. Collection information</b><br>
          </p>
          <p>
              We collect and use various types of information about you and your accounts to service
              your accounts, save you time and money, better respond to your needs, and manage
              our business and risks.</p>
          <p>
              Customer Information is categorized in the following six ways:</p>
          <p>
              <b>A. Identification Information</b> — information that identifies you such as name,
              address, telephone number and Social Security number.</p>
          <p>
              <b>B. Application Information</b> — information you provide to us on applications
              and through other means that will help us determine if you are eligible for products
              you request. Examples include assets, income and debt.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>C. Transaction and Experience Information</b> — information about transactions
              and account experience, as well as information about our communications with you.
              Examples include account balances, payment history, account usage, and your inquiries
              and our responses.</p>
          <p>
              <b>D. Consumer Report Information</b> — information from a consumer report. Examples
              include credit score and credit history.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>E. Information from Outside Sources</b> — information from outside sources regarding
              employment, credit and other relationships that will help us determine if you are
              eligible for products you request. Examples include employment history, loan balances,
              credit card balances, property insurance coverage and other verifications.</p>
          <p>
              <b>F. Other General Information</b> — information from outside sources, such as
              data from public records, that is not assembled or used for the purpose of determining
              eligibility for a product or service.</p>
          <p>
              As required by the USA PATRIOT Act, we also collect information and take actions
              necessary to verify your identification.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>3. Managing Information</b></p>
          <p>
              We manage how and when information is shared:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Within Bank of America</li>
              <li>With companies that work for us</li>
              <li>With third parties</li>
              <li>In other situations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              <b>Managing information within Bank of America</b></p>
          <p>
              Bank of America is made up of a number of companies, including financial service
              providers such as our brokerage company and credit card company, and nonfinancial
              companies such as our operations and servicing subsidiaries.
          </p>
          <p>
              Bank of America may share any of the categories of Customer Information among our
              companies. For example, sharing information allows us to use information about your
              ATM, credit card and check card transactions to identify any unusual activity and
              then contact you to determine if your card has been lost or stolen.</p>
          <p>
              We occasionally receive medical or health information from a customer if, for example,
              a customer applies for insurance from us. We also may obtain information from insurance
              support organizations not affiliated with Bank of America that prepare and provide
              reports to others as well as to us. We do not share medical or health information
              among our companies, except to maintain or collect on accounts, process transactions,
              service customer requests or perform insurance functions, to the extent permitted
              by law.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Managing information with companies that work for us</b></p>
          <p>
              We may share any of the categories of Customer Information with companies that work
              for us, including companies located outside the United States. All nonaffiliated
              companies that act on our behalf and receive Customer Information from us are contractually
              obligated to keep the information we provide to them confidential, and to use the
              Customer Information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform.
              These companies may include financial service providers such as payment processing
              companies, and nonfinancial companies such as check printing and data processing
              companies.</p>
          <p>
              In addition, we may share any of the categories of Customer Information with companies
              that work for us in order to provide marketing support and other services, such
              as a service provider that distributes marketing materials. These companies may
              help us to market our own products and services, or other products and services
              that we believe may be of interest to you. Please note that some of our own companies
              may provide marketing support and other services for us as well.

              We also may disclose any of the categories of Customer Information to credit bureaus

              disclosed to companies that process your requests for products or services or in
              connection with the sale of your account to another financial institution. We also
              may share any of the categories of Customer Information outside Bank of America

              You may choose not to receive direct marketing offers - sent by postal mail, telephone
              and/or e-mail - from Bank of America. These preferences apply to all marketing offers
              from us and from companies working for us. To minimize the amount of telephone solicitation
              our customers receive, Bank of America does not offer nonfinancial products and
              services through telephone solicitations. Direct marketing offers from us may include
              information about products and services we believe may be of interest to you. If
              you choose not to hear from us, you may not learn about beneficial offers.
          </p>
          <p>
              If you elect not to receive direct marketing offers by postal mail, telephone and/or

              your account and for other nonmarketing purposes. You may also be contacted from
              your client relationship manager or assigned account representative if applicable.
              Bank of America may also continue to provide marketing information in your regular

          <p>
              Each customer may opt out of each direct marketing option individually. Since marketing
              programs may already be in progress, it may take up to twelve weeks in some situations
              for your opt out to be fully effective in some situations. When you opt out of direct
              marketing by postal mail or telephone, your opt out will last for five (5) years.
              After that, you may choose to renew your opt out for another five year period.

              You may contact the following agencies if you want to reduce the amount of advertising
              you receive from companies outside Bank of America:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Credit Reporting Industry.</b>To have your name taken off all pre-approved credit
                  solicitations (not just Bank of America solicitations), you may call the credit
                  reporting industry Prescreening Opt-Out number at 1.888.5OPTOUT (1.888.567.8688).</li>

              <b>7. Guarding your own information</b></p>
          <p>
              Bank of America recommends that you take the following precautions to guard against
              the disclosure and unauthorized use of your account and personal information:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Review your monthly account statements thoroughly and report any suspicious activity
                  to us immediately.</li>
              <li>Report lost or stolen checks, credit or debit cards immediately.</li>
              <li>Do not preprint your driver's license or Social Security number on checks.</li>
              <li>Safeguard ATM, credit and debit cards. Memorize PINs (personal identification numbers)
                  and refrain from writing PINs, Social Security numbers or credit card numbers where
                  they could be found. </li>
              <li>Tear up or shred any pre-approved credit offers to which you do not respond.</li>
              <li>Review your credit report at least once every year. Make sure all information is
                  up to date and accurate, and have information relating to fraudulent transactions
                  deleted. For a free copy of your credit bureau report, contact www.annualcreditreport.com
                  or call 1.877.322.8228.</li>
              <li>If you think you have been a victim of identity theft or fraud, contact one of the
                  three major credit bureaus to place a fraud alert on your account. You may also
                  contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to report any incidents of identity theft
                  and to receive additional guidance on steps you can take to protect yourself. You
                  may contact the FTC at www.consumer.gov/idtheft or 1.877.438.4338.</li>

      <br>
      <a name="authentication"></a> <span class="title">Authentication<br>
      <br>
      </span>Authentication is the process that our clients go through
to
access secure areas of our Web site. This process takes place when you
log into your account. The key components of log-in are your Login
ID, Password, challenge questions, and computer registration. <br>
      <br>
Login ID:&nbsp; Upon receipt of a request from you and appropriate
validation, U.S. Trust will designate a Login ID for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We do not use any combination of SSN or birth date as part of your
Login ID.<br>
      <br>
Passwords:&nbsp; We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from
guessing your password and recommend that you change your password
periodically.&nbsp; While password parameters vary slightly by
application, in general, your password must meet the following
criteria: <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>A system-designated minimum character length</li>
        <li>Include both letters and numbers</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
Challenge Questions and Computer Registration:&nbsp; Once you receive a Login ID
      and create a password, you will be required to select challenge questions
      and provide answers before accessing your online accounts for the first time.
      Your selected question(s) will be posed the first time you log onto your U.S. Trust
      account from any computer.  After successfully answering the question(s), you
      will be presented with the choice of registering the computer from which you are
      accessing the site.  By registering the computer, you will not be required to
      answer the challenge question(s) each time you log in from that same computer.
      You can register more than one computer at the same time (e.g., home, office, and laptop).  <br>
      <br>
      For your protection, repeated unsuccessful attempts to log in or the inability to properly
      answer the challenge questions will cause your online access to be disabled. Once
      this happens, your password must be reset. If this happens to you inadvertently, please call
      the U.S. Trust Online Client Support Group at 1-800-944-9592, option 1 or your relationship
      officer to have your password reset.<br>

      </p>
      <p> <a name="site_security"></a><span class="title">Web Site
Security<br>
      </span></p>
      <p>From the time you submit your Login ID and Password,
communications between your computer and U.S. Trust are encrypted using
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL3) technology, a secure communication protocol
that protects your privacy. SSL enables client and server applications
to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,
tampering and message forgery. <br>
      <br>
To support this technology, you need a recent version of an
SSL3-capable, 128-bit browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or
AOL. These browsers will activate SSL3 automatically whenever you sign
on to your U.S. Trust account. <br>
      <br>
Look for the padlock! To ensure that SSL encryption is protecting your
private communications, look for a small picture of a padlock on the
browser frame. Another indicator is the URL prefix “HTTPS.”&nbsp; See
below.<br>
      </p>
      <img name="security_guarantee" src="images/security_guarantee_privacy.jpg">
      <p><br>
If you move the cursor over the “locked padlock” icon, a pop-up message
will appear stating “SSL Secured (128 Bit).”&nbsp; Absence of the
pop-up message may indicate that you are connected to a “phishing” site.<br>
      <br>
Another important information security measure in place throughout U.S.
Trust’s web sites is the timeout feature. This feature will log you out
of your account, if there has been no activity within a specified
amount of time. It is designed to stop others from accessing your
account, if you fail to log out. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We have implemented these measures for
your protection, but you should still remember to log out each time you
have finished accessing your U.S. Trust accounts.</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <b>Cookies</b>: <br>
Cookies enable us to understand better how you and others use U.S. Trust's
      online channels. They allow us to collect information about where your browser
      goes on our Web sites. This assists us in understanding your preferences and
      improving our Web site. For example, the information we obtain from cookies or
      Graphical Interchange Formats helps us understand whether our customers use certain
      Web features and how to improve navigation.  Knowing where your browser has been
      on our Web site helps us present useful information and offers to you. We do not
      sell this or any other information about you to other Web sites, merchants or financial
      institutions.<br>
      <br>
Cookies come in two types: session-based and persistent. U.S. Trust uses both session-based and persistent cookies. <br>
      <br>
Session cookies exist only during an online session with U.S. Trust.  They disappear from your computer when you
      close your browser software or turn off your computer. Session cookies allow you to
      conduct transactions or request your own personal or account information on our Web site.
      They contain encrypted or encoded information about your account(s), and/or identifying
      information that you have previously provided to us. This information allows U.S. Trust to
      process your online transactions and requests.<br>
      <br>
      Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer.
      They include a unique identifier for your browser that only US Trust can read and use,
      and that tells us you are a US Trust client or prior US Trust Web site visitor. We are
      especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information we send through
      persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in
      persistent cookies.

      <br>
      </p>
      <p>Recently there has been rapid growth in email-related
information security challenges such as “phishing” or “spoofing”
schemes. These fraudulent techniques attempt to fool you into giving up
your personal data by impersonating legitimate communications from
financial service providers. We are working with other financial
institutions and technology leaders to prevent these security
challenges from impacting our clients. Measures currently in place or
underway include:&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of domain-verification
technologies that, in cooperation with Internet service providers, will
enable clients to verify that emails claiming to have come from U.S.
Trust actually did come from U.S. Trust.</li>
        <li>Standardization of U.S. Trust emails and
adherence to industry anti-phishing best practices. We continually
re-design our email policies to incorporate the latest tools and
standards aimed at preventing phishing. </li>
        <li>Ongoing assessment and implementation of
new log-in technologies designed to prevent others from masquerading as
our Web site. </li>

We use automated transactional monitoring tools to detect suspicious

      <b>Client Security Practices</b> <br>
Your participation is an important component of all of our
security efforts. We believe it is essential that we work in close
cooperation with you as our client to maintain the highest levels of
security.&nbsp; These are the steps you should take to protect your
account: <br>
      </p>
      <b>Protecting the security of your computer&nbsp; <br>
      </b>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your computer and browser software
current with security updates.</li>
        <li>Install and update anti-virus and anti-spyware
software and use personal firewalls to protect your computer.</li>
        <li>Be alert to the threats posed by malware—short for
malicious software, this form of software is designed specifically to
damage or disrupt a system, or to secretly record information such as
keystrokes. Malware types include key logging tools, trojan horses,
hijacking programs, and dialer programs that may reside on your
personal computer. While these threats constantly evolve, you can help
protect your personal information and computer by using a personal
firewall, maintaining up-to-date anti-spyware and anti-virus programs,
and by immediately reporting any suspicious activity involving your
personal information. </li>
        <li>Do not enable any application features that would
automatically log you into your U.S. Trust account or pre-fill the
Login ID or Password fields. </li>
        <li>Change your password periodically, and avoid using
passwords for U.S. Trust that you commonly use for other purposes.</li>
        <li>For more information on how to protect your
personal computer, including links to vendors providing anti-virus and
anti-spyware software, please visit the Federal Trade Commission’s
computer security site at <a href="http://onguardonline.gov/index.html" class="copyLink">http://onguardonline.gov&nbsp; .</a> Microsoft
Corporation provides additional information specific to the Windows
operating system at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.mspx" class="copyLink">http://www.microsoft.com/security&nbsp;

Apple computers can find security information at
          <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/security/" class="copyLink">http://www.apple.com/support/security .</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><br>
Using your computer&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      </b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your username and password are for your
use only. Do not share them with anyone and do not write them down.</li>
        <li>Check to make sure you are interacting with a
secure Web site <a href="#site_security" class="copyLink">see above.</a></li>
        <li>Always log off after accessing your U.S. Trust
account. This prevents someone else from accessing your account if you
leave your computer unattended while the session has not yet “timed
out,” or automatically shut down.</li>
        <li>Be careful about using third-party computers or
computers that you are not familiar with, such as those in Internet
cafés. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you do use a third-party computer, be particularly careful
to ensure you have fully logged out. U.S.Trust's systems are set to
prevent browsers from saving account information in a computer’s
Internet cache, but as an extra precaution you may want to clear the
cache of any public computer on which you have accessed your U.S. Trust
accounts. Please check the browser’s help section to learn how to
manually clear its Internet cache. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Reading your statements<br>
      <br>
      </b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review your account statements carefully.</li>
        <li>You should only download your statements onto your
own computer.&nbsp; Do not download them onto a <a href="#commitment" class="copyLink">third-party computer.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Recognizing and fighting fraud <br>
      <br>
      </b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not provide personal or financial
information in response to an email request or by clicking on a link,
unless you are able to verify the authenticity of the site to which you
are taken through the SSL padlock or other means.</li>
        <li>Do not enter personal information into a form
within an email message or a pop-up.</li>
        <li>Note that U.S. Trust will never ask you to provide
personal financial information in an email.</li>
        <li>Do not open an email from a sender that you do not
recognize. Be particularly cautious of any attachments to emails from
unrecognized sources.</li>
        <li>Immediately report any unusual activity regarding
your U.S. Trust accounts to our representatives at 1-800-USTRUST.</li>

      <p><b>What Is Phishing? </b><br>
      <span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Phishing
is the illegal
attempt to mislead consumers into providing personal or financial
information,
including account numbers, passwords and Social Security numbers, via
email or
through fraudulent Web sites. <br>
      <br>
The most frequent phishing attacks occur through email disguised to
appear as
though it came from a reputable financial institution or company. <br>
      <br>
Most phishing attempts urge you to update or validate your account
information,
typically through a link in an email directing you to a fake Web site
that
appears to be legitimate. </span><br>
      </p>
      <p><b><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">How
to Spot a Phishing
Attack </span></b><br>
There are many phishing attacks active on the Internet. Here are a few
of their lines and lures: <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An email contains an “urgent” or “shocking” tone
requesting your immediate action on an account-related matter. Phishers
frequently succeed by getting consumers to act quickly without
thinking.</li>
        <li>An email is sent from a user falsely claiming to be
a legitimate company with an attachment. An unsolicited email
attachment more than likely contains a virus. Do not open it. </li>
        <li>A pop-up window appears from a user falsely
claiming to be a legitimate company’s Web site asking for personal
information.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Report the identity theft and
request a "fraud alert." This ensures that you will be contacted before
any new account is opened and/or an existing account is changed.</li>
        <li>Request copies of credit reports. Review
the reports carefully and identify any new accounts that may have been
opened. Pay particular attention to the section of the report that
lists "inquiries" from new companies. Contact these companies
immediately and have them remove any pending or new accounts from their
system. Note: Credit bureaus must provide free copies of credit reports
to victims of identity theft. </li>
        <li>Contact the fraud departments of creditors
to dispute unauthorized charges (e.g., credit card issuer, phone
companies, utilities, banks, other lenders.) Describe your identity
theft problem and follow up with a letter.</li>
        <li>File a report with your local police department.
This may help when clearing your credit.</li>
        <li>File a complaint with the Federal Trade
