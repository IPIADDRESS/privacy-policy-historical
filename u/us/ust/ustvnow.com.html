This Privacy Policy applies to all USTVNOW Members and/or USTVNOW Users.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Information That We Collect<br><br>When you register to become an USTVNOW Member and/or become an USTVNOW User, we may collect the following data from you:<br><br>Personal Data: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register to become an USTVNOW Member, become an USTVNOW User and/or contact us with inquiries that may contain such data.

This Aggregate Data does not identify you personally.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Additional Information About Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Data<br><br>If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal Data for that purpose. For example, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to USTVNOW, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to USTVNOW. We may also use your Personal Data to monitor your use of USTVNOW and to contact you regarding your use of USTVNOW.

If we do so, each email we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future emails. If at any time you wish not to receive any future emails or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Children<br><br>While USTVNOW provides USTVNOW Equipment and/or the USTVNOW Platform by which Members may choose to access broadcast television and other content, our Terms of Use expressly prohibit anyone under eighteen (18) from registering for an USTVNOW Membership and require that any use of an USTVNOW Membership by a family member under the age of eighteen (18) be under the direct supervision of their parent or guardian. We do not intentionally seek to collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen (13), nor do we knowingly collect Personal Data from children younger than thirteen (13).

In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your Personal Data and/or Other Data.<br><br>Legal Requirements: USTVNOW may disclose your Personal Data and/or Other Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or a government request, (ii) verify compliance with or enforce our Terms of Use or protect and defend the rights or property of USTVNOW, USTVNOW Users or others (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of USTVNOW Members, USTVNOW Users or the public and/or (iv) protect against legal liability.<br><br>Third Party Services: USTVNOW allows you to enable and/or or log in via various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook or Twitter and email providers such as Google or Yahoo ("Third Party Services") and allows some aspects of those services to be integrated into the USTVNOW Platform. For example, if you log in to USTVNOW using a social networking service, information that you share via that service may be reflected on the USTVNOW Platform. Likewise, if you enable USTVNOW to have access to an email contact through a Third Party Service, USTVNOW may use that data to send an invitation or market to that contact.<br><br>When you log into or use USTVNOW using your Third Party Services account, we will collect and share relevant information necessary to enable the USTVNOW website or account to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service. The Third Party Service may collect information as well. Please remember that the manner in which a Third Party Service collects, stores and discloses your information is governed solely by the policies of that Third Party Service and USTVNOW will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices, terms of use and/or other actions of any third party site or service that you may enable.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Exclusions<br><br>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data that is intentionally collected by USTVNOW through and/or in connection with USTVNOW's website, Equipment and/or Platform.
