We are committed to complying with all applicable federal, state and local privacy laws and regulations. We strive to provide an environment in which our customers trust us to handle personal information responsibly. We provide this privacy notice as part of our commitment to privacy by describing the personal information that we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and with whom we share it.<br><br>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information, including personally identifiable data, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, internet protocol address and payment and/or credit card information (collectively, "Personal Data"), as well as certain other information including, without limitation, demographic and usage information (collectively "Other Data"). Such Personal Data and Other Data may be collected from and about, or with respect to, USTVNOW Members and/or users of: a) any USTVNOW website, including the current site at USTVNOW.com, b) USTVNOW Equipment and/or c) the USTVNOW Platform ("USTVNOW Users"). This Privacy Policy applies to all USTVNOW Members and/or USTVNOW Users.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Information That We Collect<br><br>When you register to become an USTVNOW Member and/or become an USTVNOW User, we may collect the following data from you:<br><br>Personal Data: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register to become an USTVNOW Member, become an USTVNOW User and/or contact us with inquiries that may contain such data.

In addition, USTVNOW and/or a third party may compile Personal Data and/or Other Data on an aggregated basis ("Aggregate Data"). USTVNOW may share this Aggregate Data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This Aggregate Data does not identify you personally.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Additional Information About Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Data<br><br>If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal Data for that purpose. For example, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to USTVNOW, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to USTVNOW. We may also use your Personal Data to monitor your use of USTVNOW and to contact you regarding your use of USTVNOW.

If we do so, each email we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future emails. If at any time you wish not to receive any future emails or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Children<br><br>While USTVNOW provides USTVNOW Equipment and/or the USTVNOW Platform by which Members may choose to access broadcast television and other content, our Terms of Use expressly prohibit anyone under eighteen (18) from registering for an USTVNOW Membership and require that any use of an USTVNOW Membership by a family member under the age of eighteen (18) be under the direct supervision of their parent or guardian. We do not intentionally seek to collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen (13), nor do we knowingly collect Personal Data from children younger than thirteen (13). If you are under the age of thirteen (13), you are not permitted to submit, and please do not submit, any Personal Data through USTVNOW and/or in connection with any Member account. If you think that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided Personal Data to USTVNOW, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Our Disclosure of Your Data<br><br>There are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and/or Other Data with certain third parties without further notice to you:<br><br>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell, buy or merge businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data and/or Other Data may be part of the transferred assets.<br><br>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: USTVNOW, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies and/or consultants to perform certain business-related functions.

In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your Personal Data and/or Other Data.<br><br>Legal Requirements: USTVNOW may disclose your Personal Data and/or Other Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or a government request, (ii) verify compliance with or enforce our Terms of Use or protect and defend the rights or property of USTVNOW, USTVNOW Users or others (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of USTVNOW Members, USTVNOW Users or the public and/or (iv) protect against legal liability.<br><br>Third Party Services: USTVNOW allows you to enable and/or or log in via various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook or Twitter and email providers such as Google or Yahoo ("Third Party Services") and allows some aspects of those services to be integrated into the USTVNOW Platform. For example, if you log in to USTVNOW using a social networking service, information that you share via that service may be reflected on the USTVNOW Platform. Likewise, if you enable USTVNOW to have access to an email contact through a Third Party Service, USTVNOW may use that data to send an invitation or market to that contact.<br><br>When you log into or use USTVNOW using your Third Party Services account, we will collect and share relevant information necessary to enable the USTVNOW website or account to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service. The Third Party Service may collect information as well. Please remember that the manner in which a Third Party Service collects, stores and discloses your information is governed solely by the policies of that Third Party Service and USTVNOW will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices, terms of use and/or other actions of any third party site or service that you may enable.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Exclusions<br><br>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data that is intentionally collected by USTVNOW through and/or in connection with USTVNOW's website, Equipment and/or Platform.

USTVNOW has no obligation with respect to such unsolicited information and will be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.<br><br>The USTVNOW Platform may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by USTVNOW ("Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Security -How We Protect Your Information<br><br>USTVNOW takes reasonable steps including physical, electronic and procedural measures to safeguard the Personal Data in our possession against loss, misuse, theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification.<br><br>However, no Internet or email transmission or electronic storage of information is ever completely secure or error free.

You should take special care in deciding what information you send via USTVNOW. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data and/or Other Data to USTVNOW or utilizing any social networking features in connection with USTVNOW.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Changes and Updates<br><br>USTVNOW, our business and the law may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for USTVNOW to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
