<div id="page_text"><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><strong><font face="Arial">1. What This Policy Covers</font></strong></font><font size="2"><br>
</font><font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#000000">
This policy covers all the Services provided by uSocial as laid out in the <a href="/terms" title="">Terms</a>.
In any case where more detailed information is needed to further

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000" size="5"><font size="3"><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><strong>2. Information You Provide</strong></font><br>
</font></font>In the event that you sign up for any kind of uSocial
account, or other uSocial service or promotion that requires
registration, we ask
you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an
account password). For certain services, such as our advertising
programs, we may also request credit card or other payment account
information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers which are operated by third parties such as 2Checkout.com. We
may combine the information you submit under your account with
information from other uSocial services or third parties in order to
provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our
services, however we will never share this information with any outside or unauthorised party. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt
out of combining such information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>3. Cookies</strong></font><br>
When you visit uSocial, we may at any point send one or more cookies – a small file
containing a string of characters which is loaded onto your computer – to your computer that uniquely
identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our
service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as
how people search. uSocial may also use cookies in its advertising services
to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web.
We may set a cookie in your browser when you visit a website and view
or click on an ad supported by uSocial's advertising services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>4. Information Recording</strong></font><br>
When you access uSocial Services, our servers automatically record
information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These
server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet
Protocol
(IP) address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your
request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your
browser.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>5. User Communication</strong></font><br>
When you send email or other communications to uSocial, we may retain
those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to
your requests and improve our services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>6. Affiliated Websites</strong></font><br>
We may offer some of our services in connection with other web sites.
Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to
uSocial in order to deliver the service. We process such information in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites may have
different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy
policies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>7. Links</strong></font><br>
uSocial may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of
whether these links have been followed. We use this information to
improve the quality of our search technology, customised content and
advertising.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>8. Other Websites</strong></font><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to uSocial services only. We do not exercise
control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within
our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or
other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal
information from you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>9. Collection</strong></font><br>
uSocial only processes personal information for the purposes
described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy
notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes
include:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>a.</strong></font> Providing our services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising;<br>
<br><font color="#0000ff"><strong>b.</strong></font> Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;<br>
<br><font color="#0000ff"><strong>c.</strong></font> Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and<br>
<br><font color="#0000ff"><strong>d.</strong></font> Developing new services.</font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">uSocial processes personal information on servers in the
United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we
process personal information on a server outside your own country. We
may process personal information to provide our own services. In some
cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according
to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising and affiliated partners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>10. Sharing of Information</strong></font><br>
uSocial only shares personal information with other companies or
individuals outside of uSocial in the following limited circumstances:<br>
</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>a.</strong></font> We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.<br>
<br><font color="#0000ff"><strong>b.</strong></font> We
provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or
other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree
to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance
with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and
security measures.<br>
<br><font color="#0000ff"><strong>c.</strong></font> We have a good faith belief that access, use,
preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary
to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of
Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c)
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or
safety of uSocial, its users or the public as required or permitted by
law. </font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">If uSocial becomes involved in a merger,
acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will
provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes
subject to a different privacy policy. Please <a href="/contact" title="">contact us</a> for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>11. Security</strong></font><br>
We take appropriate security measures to protect against
unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as
well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access
to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to uSocial
employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in
order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals
are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to
discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
fail to meet these obligations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>12. Integrity</strong></font><br>
uSocial processes personal information only for the purposes for which
it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any
applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data
collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only
collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide
or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the
personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but
we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information
whenever necessary.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>13. Information Updating</strong></font><br>
When you use uSocial services, we make good faith efforts to provide you
with access to your personal information and either to correct this
data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it
is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate
business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and
the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that
are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be
extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
required. In any case where we provide information access and
correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so
would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have
different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal
information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>14. Enforcement</strong></font><br>
uSocial regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy.
Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this
Privacy Policy or uSocial’s treatment of personal information by <a href="/contact" title="">contacting us</a> through this website. When
we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is uSocial’s
policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns.
We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities,
including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints
regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between uSocial and an individual. </font></p><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><strong>15. Changes</strong></font><br>
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We
will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your
explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.
Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and,
if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice
(including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy
changes). If you have any other questions or concerns regarding any part of this privacy policy, please do not hesitate to <a href="/contact" title="">contact us</a></font> <font face="Arial">through this website.</font>.</div></div><!-- FOOTER -->
