All Rights Reserved. Use of this Web site signifies your agreement to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p></div><div class=""><h2>Privacy Policy</h2><p>The USGA recognizes the importance its visitors place on privacy issues. We have created this privacy policy statement ("Privacy Policy") to ensure that you understand our policies and procedures. Any information you give us online will only be used in accordance with the practices described below. Please note that our online information collection and use practices may differ from our practices regarding information obtained offline.
</p><p> 
This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you from the USGA Sites (see our Terms and Conditions page at http://www.usga.org/info/terms_of_use.html for a list of USGA Sites) and how we use such information. Our statement also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. By visiting any USGA Site, you are consenting to accept the practices described below. If you do not agree with the privacy policy practices described below, please do not use any USGA Site.
</p><p> 
We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time.
</p><p> 
This Privacy Policy was last revised in November 2004.
</p><p><b>What Information Does The USGA Collect?</b></p><p> 
The USGA collects two types of information from users of the USGA Sites: non-personal information (i.e., information - such the type of Internet browser you are using - that cannot be used to specifically identify you) and personal information (e.g., name, address, email, phone number, and credit card information) that does specifically identify you.
</p><p> 
The USGA regularly collects non-personal information about users of the USGA Sites. For example, when you visit any USGA Site, our web server automatically recognizes your Internet Protocol (IP) address as well as other information about your visit to the Site, all of which is non-identifying and used to compile statistics about traffic to our web site and for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p><p> 
When using a USGA Site, you may be asked to provide or otherwise choose to provide personal information. For example, the USGA collects the following identifying information:
</p><ul><li>When you visit www.usga.org to submit an on-line entry application for a USGA Championship, we ask for your name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date. In addition, we ask for information concerning your golf background including whether you are an Amateur or a Professional, the name and address of your golf club and your USGA Handicap Index. This information allows us to process and evaluate your entry application.</li><li>When you sign up as a USGA member at www.usga.org, we ask for your e-mail address, mailing address, daytime phone number, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your registration, to notify you of your registration status and to otherwise contact you with respect to your membership.</li><li>When you sign up for a Handicap Seminar at www.usga.org, we ask for your name, mailing and e-mail address, and telephone and fax numbers. In addition we ask if you are a PGA Member and if so, we ask you to provide your member number. This information allows us to process your registration form to ensure your space at the Seminar.</li><li>When you make purchases from our on-line catalog located at www.usgashop.com, we ask for your name, telephone number, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This information allows us to process your order and to notify you of your order status. We may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have questions regarding your order. In addition, if you are a USGA Member, we also ask for your membership identification number so that you may receive the appropriate membership discount.</li></ul> <br>
The above examples are intended as illustrations and are not intended to be exhaustive or to imply further restrictions on our usage of information. Please note that we do collect personal information on areas of the USGA Sites not mentioned above, but we always obtain that information from you voluntarily.
<p></p><p><b>How Does The USGA Use My Information?</b></p><p> 
The USGA uses the information collected, including personal information, for a variety of purposes. For instance, we use your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better products and services. We may use your information to communicate back to you, to update you on products, services and benefits, to personalize a particular USGA Site experience for you, to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information, newsletters, or other information we think would be of particular interest.
</p><p> 
For example, we may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you via e-mail about USGA news and other announcements or changes to USGA Sites. If you do not want to receive an e-mail from us, please e-mail us at membership@usga.org or call us at (908) 234-2300.
</p><p> 
We may also share your information, including personal information, with our affiliates, technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make the USGA Sites available, enhance their functionality, provide associated services, or who deal with you in processing your orders or delivering content, samples, products, services and gifts and prizes (our "Representatives"). Please note that we reserve the right to transfer your personal information and other information in the event we undergo a business restructuring or similar transaction. You should also note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose personal information and non-personal information we gather as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the applicable site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which the USGA deems improper.
</p><p> 
Subject to our special policy regarding the sharing of email addresses (see below), the USGA may also share your personal and non-personal information with certain third parties with whom we do business (including, for example, our content providers and vendors), so that such third parties can contact you regarding products, services, offers, or other information we think you will find valuable. These third parties may also use the information to generate aggregate reports and market research or for other purposes. If you would rather not have us share this information with third parties, you can opt-out of such sharing by notifying us in accordance with the "Contact Us/Opt-Out" Section below. Make sure you notify us for each account or e-mail address you have left with us.
</p><p> 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not share email addresses with third parties other than our Representatives, unless you give us your consent to do so.
</p><p> 
Information obtained through a USGA Site may be combined with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources. For example, if you visit the USGA's Online Catalog located at www.shop.usga.com, we may combine the information you share with other demographic information. We use this combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us and to send you a USGA Catalog.
</p><p> 
Please note that although we reserve the right to freely share your non-personal information for advertising, promotional and other purposes, we will only use your personal information as permitted under this Privacy Policy unless you provide your consent for us to do otherwise. We will seek to obtain your consent either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an email).
</p><p><b>What Are "Cookies" And "Web Beacons" And How Does The USGA Use Them?</b></p><p> 
The USGA uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. Your cookie allows the USGA to recognize you when you return to any Site and provides you with access to account information you may have entered on any USGA Site. Cookies allow us to monitor and maintain information about your use of a USGA Site in a manner that does not identify you. We do not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.
</p><p> 
As a specific example of how we use cookies, the USGA writes cookies when you visit www.usga.org to fill out an on-line entry application for any USGA Championship. This cookie allows the USGA to recognize you if you return to the Site to complete a USGA Championship entry application, thereby making your next on-line application process smoother and more friendly.
</p><p> 
As another example, the USGA uses cookies to improve your shopping experience when you visit our Online Catalog located at www.shop.usga.com. When you shop at our Online Catalog, your cookie helps us keep track of the items you put in your shopping cart and whether you visited www.shop.usga.com previously. Cookies can also be used to save information on past purchases and other preferences. This way you do not have to re-enter information upon every new visit to www.shop.usga.com. Your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to this USGA Site and provides you with access to your account information. If you order from us, we use your cookie to monitor and maintain information about your use of this USGA Site. If you have not ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of this Site in a manner that does not identify you.
</p><p> 
You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our Online Catalog. Nor will we be able to recognize you when you visit a USGA Site or allow you access to your account information.
</p><p> 
The USGA also uses web beacon technology to help track USGA Site usage. Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow the USGA to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use to focus and tailor future content development and otherwise measure and improve the performance of our Sites.
</p><p> 
Please note that at times, some of the advertisers on the USGA Sites and their and our ad service providers (including affiliate network providers and third party ad servers) may set cookies or use related technologies or web beacons when you click their advertising banners, links or other ads. While we use cookies and web beacons on parts of the USGA Sites (as discussed above), information from cookies and other technologies received with third party ads and links may be collected directly by those advertisers and ad service providers. The advertiser's privacy policy and/or that of its service provider will govern the use of this information and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such companies.
</p><p><b>Clickstream Data</b></p><p> 
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to a USGA Site. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of a USGA Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any personal information.
</p><p><b>How Does The USGA Protect My Information?</b></p><p> 
The security of your personal information is important to us. For example, when you register as a member or order from our on-line catalog at www.shop.usga.com, we offer the use of a secure server. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and any USGA Site, or information stored on any USGA Site or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Site demonstrates your assumption of this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
</p><p><b>Children's Policy</b></p><p> 
The USGA is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act which became effective April 21, 2000, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 13 submits information to us though any USGA Site, we will not use that information for any purpose.
</p><p> 
www.shop.usga.com offers children's merchandise for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you must have the consent of your parent or guardian before making any purchases on www.shop.usga.com or on any USGA Site.
</p><p><b>Contact Us/Opt-Out</b></p><p> 
The USGA welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Feel free to contact us for any reason, including a request to be added to or taken off a list, such as our mailing list for the USGA Catalog. Please send us an e-mail at membership@usga.org. You can also contact us at United States Golf Association, PO Box 746, Far Hills, New Jersey, 07931. The USGA also includes opt-out information in most emails it sends out and some pages on USGA Sites may include separate, additional opt-out mechanisms. Please note that the USGA is not responsible for removing information from third party lists or databases. However, you can restrict the use of your personal information by certain direct mail companies by contacting: Mail Preference Service c/o Direct Marketing Association, PO Box 9008, Farmingdale, NJ 11735-9008.
</p><p><b>Community Tools and Communications with Us</b></p><p> 
You should be aware that personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online may be viewed and used by others. In addition, personal information you post to message boards, community tools or other publicly accessible forums may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. We are unable to control such uses of your personal information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties. Any communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is, and will be treated as, nonconfidential and nonproprietary. Except to the extent expressly covered by this Privacy Policy, anything you transmit or post may be used by us for any purpose, including but not limited to, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast and posting. Furthermore, you expressly agree that we are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to us without compensation and for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services using such information.
</p><p><b>Site Terms and Conditions</b></p><p> 
Use of the USGA Sites is governed by, and subject to, the legal terms and conditions contained at http://www.usga.org/info/terms_of_use.html. Your use, or access, of the any USGA Site constitutes your agreement to be bound by these provisions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE ANY USGA SITE.
</p><p> 
By using the any USGA Site, you also authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us. Our headquarters is in the USA in the State of New Jersey. This Privacy Policy and our legal obligations are subject to the laws of New Jersey and the USA, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the USA in the State of New Jersey.
</p><p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p><p> 
Due to rapid changes in internet technology, this Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. All revisions will be posted to this site, and will apply to all data collected by the USGA before and after the revised policy's effective date.
