<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>USRA's Privacy Policy helps assure that our clients and visitors receive quality services with high integrity. The Policy describes how we collect, store and use information about visitors to the USRA Web site. It will be periodically assessed as new technologies are developed and when business practices or clients' needs change. When necessary, we will modify our Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. When modifications occur, they will appear in this policy statement.</p> 

<p><br>USRA is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by the following statement:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Collection. Personally-identifiable information will be collected only to the extent that USRA deems reasonably necessary to serve a legitimate business purpose.</li> 
<li>Notification. Visitors will be notified (usually at the point where personally-identifiable information is collected) about how USRA may use the personally-identifiable information that is collected from them.</li> 
<li>Sensitive Data. The collection, storage and use of sensitive data carries special obligations and responsibilities in order to maintain the data's security, integrity and privacy.

<h2>INFORMATION USRA COLLECTS AUTOMATICALLY FROM YOU</h2>
<p>USRA collects no personally-identifiable information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, we do collect and store certain other information automatically that does not identify you personally. We automatically collect:</p> 

<ul>
<li>the Internet domain. For example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain</li> 
<li>the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you access the Internet (e.g., 123.456.789.012), whether it is yours individually or provided as a proxy by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) through which you access our Web site</li>

<li>the date and time you access our Web site</li>

<li>the address of a referring Web site (if you linked to our site from another Web site)</li> 
</ul>
<p>We use this information in the form of summary statistics to help us make our Web site more useful to our clients and visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest, and for other purposes such as determining the Web site's design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>

<p><br>This information is NOT shared with anyone except USRA and its affiliated and subsidiary operations, as applicable.</p> 

<h2>SENDING USRA PERSONAL OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>If you choose to provide USRA with personally-identifiable information--by sending us an e-mail message or by filling out an online form and submitting it to us through our Web site--please be aware that we may use the information to improve our service to you, respond to your request, or send you relevant marketing information. Your message could be saved in an electronic database or forwarded, in print or as e-mail, to others within USRA or its affiliated and subsidiary operations who may be better able to help you. Except as required by law, we do not share our e-mail with outside organizations.</p> 

<p><br>Please note that e-mail is not secure from interception, so senders cannot expect privacy. This also applies to sending online forms, unless the form is secure.

<p><br>USRA<br> 
7178 Columbia Gateway Drive<br> 
Columbia, MD 21046</p>
