    Privacy Policy Statement for USPTO</font></h1>
</center>


<p>
Thank you for visiting the United States Patent and Trademark Office website and 
reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is simple:  we will collect no
 personal information about
 you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
<p>
Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website: 

  
</p><p> <b>Information Collected and Stored Automatically </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The PTO web server collects and saves only the default information customarily 
    logged by World-Wide Web server software. Specifically, for each http request 
    received, the date and time, the originating IP address, the object requested, 
    and the completion status of the request is collected and saved. None of our 
    pages utilize cookies. </p>
  <p> We analyze these logs monthly to determine the traffic through the server 
    during that month in hits, the number of pages served, and the level of demand 
    for pages of interest during each month. We may also analyze accesses to particular 
    pages to determine US versus non-US use, government agency versus private 
    use, and other statistics that may be of value to us in establishing priorities 
    and allocating resources in order to better accomplish our dissemination mission. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>E-mail</b> submitted to PTO is saved in accordance to Department of Commerce 
  policy and NARA guidelines. If you choose to provide us with personal information 
  in e-mail, we use that information to respond to your message and to help us 
  get you the information you have requested. We do not collect personal information 
  for any purpose other than to respond to you. We only share the information 
  you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, 
  or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not store any personal information 
  independent of the e-mail message, create individual profiles with the information 
  you provide, or give it to any private organizations. We do not collect information 
  for commercial marketing. 
</p><p><b>Links to Other Sites</b> 
</p><blockquote> 
  <p>Our Website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we link 
    to private organizations, with their permission. Before leaving our website, 
    a page will appear informing you that you are leaving our server. Once you 
    link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
  
<p><b>Kids Pages</b></p>
<blockquote>
    We are especially concerned about protecting the privacy of children. We hope 
    parents and teachers are involved in childrenâ€™s Internet explorations. We 
    respect the need to protect the identity of any children who participate in 
    an Internet exhibition of their work. We do not request any information from 
    children on the Kids Pages. We do, however, encourage them to participate 
    in contests, but such participation is carried out through postal mail.
