    <p><b>Last Updated: January 30, 2009</b><br>
     USPhoneBook.com respects the privacy of our users and we have developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our 
     commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you our treatment of personally 
     identifiable information that you provide to us as a user of USPhoneBook.com or our services, or otherwise provide to 
     us through other means such as e-mail marketing from us or our partner web sites, the information we collect, how that 
     information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures.<br>
     We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our web site or services or transacting business with us. 
     By using our web site, including, without limitation, signing up for offers and/or continuing to receive information from 
     AddressesAnywhere.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are acknowledging that we 
     are not providing you with a consumer report, and are certifying that you will not use the information obtained from us for 
     any purpose covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681, et seq.).<br>

     If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on 
     how to contact us.</p>

    <p><b>1. Information we collect about you</b><br>
     <u>In general</u>. We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and e-mail address, and other 
     information that does not identify you.</p>

    <p class="indent"><b>Information you provide.</b> We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web 
     site or provide to us in some other manner, including through e-mail marketing by us, and our partners and affiliates. This 
     includes identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, and, if you transact 
     business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or 
     other financial information) (Please see "<a href="#g">How we protect your personal information</a>", below). </p>

	<p class="indent"><b>Information from other sources.</b> We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal 
     information about you from our partners and affiliates, and other third parties, and add it to our account information or 
     other information we have collected.<br> 
     <u>Use of cookies and other technologies to collect information</u>. We use various technologies to collect information from 
     your computer and about your activities on our web site.</p>

    <p class="indent"><b>Information collected automatically.</b> We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our 
     web site. This information includes your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any 
     undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "<a href="#cookies">Cookies</a>", below), and the referring web site 
     address.</p>

	<p class="indent"><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a><b>Cookies.</b> We may employ "cookies" to help customize your access to our web site, and also for the delivery of targeted 
     advertisements. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Through the use 
     of a cookie, we may automatically collect information about your online activity on our web site, such as the web pages 
     you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our web site. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your 
     experience at our web site and to facilitate the receipt of targeted advertisements. For instance, by setting a cookie on 
     our web site, you do not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our web site. Even in the 
     case where you reject a cookie, you may still use our web site. We use cookies to track, monitor and target the interests 
     of our users to further enhance the experience on our web site, and for subsequent advertising and/or delivery purposes.

	<p class="indent"><b>Other Technologies.</b> For the purpose of formatting and delivering future marketing or sales campaigns (either electronic 
     or direct), we may employ pixel tags (also known as clear gifs) to track: 1) the pages that our users visit on affiliate 
     and/or partner web sites; and 2) user opens of, and clicks on, our targeted e-mail advertising. We reserve the right to 
     employ user source information, including applicable category and interest(s), for the marketing of targeted e-mail messages 
     on behalf of our clients. This source information may be shared with our third party marketing partners, and we reserve the 
     right to retain cookie and pixel tag data indefinitely.</p>

	<p class="indent"><b>Information collected by third-parties.</b> We may also work with other businesses to bring select retail opportunities to 
     our users from us, our partner web sites, or our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. These 
     e-mail campaigns may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact 
     with the e-mail marketing material. Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe 
     options that are present at the end of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will 
     not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.</p>

     our web site, to pre-qualify you for credit card and other offers that you might find of interest, to protect against or 
     identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.<br>

     <u>Job applicants</u>. If your personal information is submitted through our web site when applying for a position with our 
     company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application. We may retain 
     your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future 
     available positions. This information may be shared with our partners and affiliates for the purpose of evaluating your 
     qualifications for the particular position or other available positions, as well as with third-party service providers 
     retained by us to collect, maintain and analyze candidate submissions for job postings.<br>
     Please review "<a href="#f">Your choices about collection and use of your information</a>," below.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><b>3. With whom we share your information</b><br>
     We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your

     inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal 
     information with:</p>
	
    <p class="indent"><b>Authorized service providers:</b> We may share your personal information with our authorized service 
     providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include sending direct and electronic mail, removing 
     duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing analysis, and supporting our web site 
     functionality.  These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are 
     not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. </p>
	
    <p class="indent"><b>Business partners:</b> We may collect, sell, or share any personal information you enter on our web site 
     or provide to us in some other manner, including via e-mail marketing. We may also work with other businesses to bring select 
     retail opportunities to our users via e-mail marketing campaigns by us, or our partner web sites/co-brands, or our marketing 
     partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. The other businesses we work with may include: (a) providers of 
     direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; 
     (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. When you open, preview or click on the advertising portion of our e-mails

     agree that as a function of opening, previewing or clicking on the advertising portion of our e-mails, you will receive new 
     or additional marketing communications from us, our marketing partners and/or affiliates. These e-mail campaigns may use 
     tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with the e-mail marketing 
     material. There are a number of places on our web site and in e-mail campaigns where you may click on a link to access other 
     web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. These third-party web sites may independently solicit and collect 
     information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your 
     activities on those web sites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party web sites you visit 
     by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

	
	<p class="indent"><b>Direct mail partners.</b> From time to time we may share our e-mail/postal mailing list with selected 
     providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
	<p class="indent"><b>E-mail lists.</b> Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe 
     options that are present at the end of each e-mail we send on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will not 
     automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.</p>
	
    <p class="indent"><b>Other Situations.</b> We also may disclose your information:<br>

    </p><ul>

      <li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law

      <li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger,

          transaction. </li>
      <li>When we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, the Federal Trade Commission’s enabling regulations, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq.).
    </li></ul>

    <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how 
     they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal 
     information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more 
     about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the web sites of those third parties. These entities or their 
     servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.<br>
     <u>Aggregated and non-personal information</u>. We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about 
     USPhoneBook.com users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or 
     characteristics of USPhoneBook.com participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By 
     opening a USPhoneBook.com account, you agree to allow USPhoneBook.com to provide such aggregate data to third parties. 
     By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when 
     AddressesAnywhere.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.</p>

    <p><b>4. Third-party reports</b><br>
     The information contained in our reports comes from proprietary sources and third party suppliers, and is beyond our control 
     to edit, modify, or change.  You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, 
     for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such information.</p>

    <p><b><a name="f" id="f"></a>5. Your choices about collection and use of your information</b><br>
     You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features 
     of our web site because such information may be required in order for you to have personalized recommendations presented 
     to you; register as a user; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our web site.
     At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us by unsubscribing. 
     In every marketing e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe 
     from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. 
     We attempt to process all such unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee 
     that you will never receive another marketing mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future 
     through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever 
     receive another e-mail marketing communication from us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe 
     hyperlink. Unsubscribing from one marketing list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all marketing lists. We may 
     send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements and 
     administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><a name="g" id="g"></a><b>6. How we protect your personal information</b><br>

     We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal 
     information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal 
     information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. When users submit information at our web site, their 
     information is protected both online and offline. The privacy of your personal information is very important to us and access 
     to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. The servers in which we store personally 
     identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, 
     misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software ("SSL") to 
     protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses 
     as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable technological 
     precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
     Therefore, we cannot warrant that your informat ion will be absolutely secure and any transmission of data at or through 
     our web site is at your own risk.<br>
     Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for 
     information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.<br>
     To the extent that user credit card-specific information (or alternate user payment method information, such as PayPay, 
     Google Check-Out, etc.) is collected by us and/or any of our partners and affiliates, this information will be kept in 
     confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without the user's prior 
     informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USPhoneBook.com, our partners and affiliates reserve the right to 
     share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users but we will not share the 
     specific credit card information with third parties without the user's prior informed consent.<br>
