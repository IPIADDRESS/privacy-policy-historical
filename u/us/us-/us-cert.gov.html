<div class="heading1">US-CERT Privacy Policy</div><p>
Thank you for visiting the US-CERT website of the Department of Homeland
Security and reviewing our privacy policy.  This privacy policy governs this
website and our activities - and yours - when you visit this site. Our
privacy policy is plain and simple. We collect NO personal information like
names or addresses when you simply visit our website.  However, if you choose
to subscribe ("opt in") to one of our information products by submitting your
email address, we will retain and use your email address solely to send you
the information product(s) you request, and for no other purpose, except as
provided in this agreement (see  Site Security, below) or explicitly
agreed to by you. If you choose to provide other personal information such as
your name and address, that information will only be used to fulfill your
request for information.            

</p><p>
We do collect some technical information when you visit to make your visit seamless.  The section below explains how we handle and collect technical information when you visit our website.            
</p><blockquote>
<p>

When you browse, read pages, or download information on this website, we
automatically gather and store certain technical information about your visit.
This information never identifies who you are.  The information we collect and
store about your visit is listed below:             
<ul>
<li>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;            

<p></p></li><li>The type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site;            
<ul>
<li> The date and time you access our site;
</li><li> The pages you visit; and
</li><li>If you linked to this website from another website, the address of that website.            
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p> This information is only used to help us make the site more useful for you.  With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology and information our visitors use.  We never track or record information about individuals and their visits.

       </p></li><li> Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
