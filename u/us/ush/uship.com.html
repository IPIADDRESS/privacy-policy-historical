<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is very important to all of us at uShip. We have established this privacy policy to explain to you how your personal information is protected, collected and used. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, phone number, and email address that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.uship.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_new"><img src="images/icons/clickseal.gif" width="91" height="73" alt="" border="0"></a></div>

<p>uShip is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  This privacy statement covers the site http://www.uShip.com.  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact a uShip privacy associate at privacy@uShip.com.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry, or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily address, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with uShip to resolve your concerns.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and subdomains of www.uShip.com (the “Site”). By visiting this website, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use or access our site.</p>
<p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the uShip User Agreement.</p>

<h2>Information Collection &amp; Use</h2>
<p>In order to use this Site, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password.  During the registration process, you are required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
<p>In general, you can browse the Site without providing us with any of personal information about yourself. Once you agree to provide us with personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information. We use your financial information, including credit card information, to verify the accuracy of your name, address and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services.</p>
<p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interest, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, your computer browser information, and your IP address.</p>
<p>If you choose to list, bid or match on the Site, we collect information about your activity and behavior. We also collect other users’ comments about you in our feedback area.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of the registration process, uShip allows members registering as a service provider the option to submit certain commercial information such as a commercial service provider’s license number, DOT number, Motor Carrier (MC) number, and/or any other authority a service provider chooses to include. It is up to each member individually to provide this information and uShip does not verify its validity. This information can be viewed by other members on the member’s profile page under the About Me section.</p>
<p>If you choose to post messages on our Community Discussion Forums, Shipment Listing Q&amp;A boards, or leave feedback for other members, we will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. See “Community Discussion Forums” section below.</p>
<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>
<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site.  If you choose to participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information, including your email address, from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. uShip stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  We don’t store anything on a referral send.  We only store their email address if they sign up.</p>

<h2>Uses of Your Information</h2>
<p>We use your personal information, including your email address, to facilitate the services you request. We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote safe matching; collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. We may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy.</p>
<p>You agree that we may use personal information, including your email address, about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site. Communications from the Site.</p>
<p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions, as well as a newsletter. You are signed up for these emails at registration and you may unsubscribe at any time by going to your account tab and opting out of the emails, or by following the directions to unsubscribe in the email.</p>
<p>Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe from each of these communications when we ask for it.  If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@uShip.com">privacy@uShip.com</a>.</p> 
<p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. Currently it is not our policy to make this information available to any third parties.</p>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your email address, username and password.  We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. Email is the primary means of communication between members doing transactions on the site and you must be able to receive this information to use uShip properly.</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or share any of your personal information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.</p>
<p>uShip Community: Your uShip userID is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your userID. Other people can see your bids, shipments you have listed, your feedback rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on. Therefore, if you associate your name with your userID, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your uShip activities. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that allow parties to the transaction to view your email address and obtain your contact information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other community members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the Site.</p>
<p>External Service Providers: There may be separate services offered by third parties that we refer to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of the Site. If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. We do not disclose your personal information, including your email address, to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent we may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent our disclosure of your personal information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. Examples of external service providers include CaféPress (http://www.cafepress.com) which operates the uShip merchandise store and BoxBundles (http://www.boxbbundles.com) which operates the uShip moving supply store.</p>
<p>Internal Service Providers for Our Operations: We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you and therefore we may provide some of your personal information, including your email address, directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced uShip related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. Examples of internal service providers include PayPal which is involved in the credit card processing function.</p>
<p>Legal Requests: uShip cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the uShip community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.</p>
<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information, including your email address, to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. See “Security Section” below.</p>

<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use a third-party tracking service called Omniture that uses cookies and log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.  We track trends in users’ usage and volume statistics to create a more efficient and usable site, and to determine areas of the site that could be improved to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>Log files are used on the website, and in any link to the website from an email.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track referrals and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. USERS CANNOT LOG IN OR REGISTER WITHOUT COOKIES.</p>
<p>When uShip sets a cookie, it is not tied to your personally identifiable information directly, rather, it is tied to your uShip username which is tied to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Cookies are only used on the website, not in email.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by uShip. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

<h2>Community Discussion Forums</h2>
<p>If you use a bulletin board on the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information, including your email address, you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. All other information pertaining to the collection and use of information can be found in the <a href="/discussion_rules.aspx">Discussion Forum rules</a>.</p>

<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>If your personally identifiable information, including your email address, changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member Account page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:service@uShip.com">service@uShip.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information, including your email address, submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Business Transitions</h2>
<p>In the event uShip goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information, including your email address, will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

<h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy and/or to our email practices, we will notify you here, by email.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy and email practices, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:service@uShip.com">service@uShip.com</a>.
