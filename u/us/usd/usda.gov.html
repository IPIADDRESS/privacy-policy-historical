		</center> 
	 <p>Thank you for visiting the U.S. Department of Agriculture website and
		reviewing our privacy statement. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect
		no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose
		to provide that information to us.</p> 
	 <p>Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:</p> 
	 <p><strong>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</strong></p> 
	 <p> If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website,
		read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
		information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify
		you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following
		information about your visit:</p> 
	 <ol> 
		<li> The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a
		  private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a
		  university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is
		  automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from
		  which you access our website;</li> 
		<li> The type of browser and operating system used to access our
		  site;</li> 
		<li> The date and time you access our site;</li> 
		<li> The pages you visit; and</li> 
		<li> If you linked to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website from
		  another website, the address of that website.</li> 
	 </ol> 
	 <p> We use this information to help us make our site more useful to
		visitors - to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of
		technology our visitors are using. We do not track or record information about
		individuals and their visits. </p> 
	 <p><strong>If You Send Us Personal Information</strong></p> 
	 <p> If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail
		to the Secretary or someone else or by filling out a form with your personal
		information and submitting it to us through our website, we use that
		information to respond to your message and to help us locate for you the
		information you have requested. We treat e-mails the same way that we regard
		letters sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We are required to maintain
		many documents under the Presidential Records Act for historical purposes, but
		we do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to
		you. We only share the information you give us with another government agency
		if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law.
		Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide
		or to give it to any private organizations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
		does not collect information for commercial marketing.</p> 
	 <p><strong>When You Visit USDA Agency/Staff Office Websites</strong></p> 
	 <p>Please read the USDA Agency/Staff Office Privacy Statement when you
		visit those websites. Where necessary, an Agency/Staff Office may have
		additional privacy criteria, conditions, or information that you should
		know.</p> 
	 <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> 
	 <p> Our website has links to many other federal agencies. In a few cases we
		link to private organizations, with their permission. Once you access another
		site through a link that we provide you are subject to the privacy policy of
		the new site.</p> 
	 <p><strong>Website Security</strong></p>

		information and may be distributed or copied. Use of appropriate

		  available to all users, this government computer system employs software

		  attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data
		  logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction
