<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Cookies are small data files that are

DECE may also use clear GIFs or similar technologies to enable DECE to know
whether you have visited a particular web page, viewed content or received a
message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image
(although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an
email or other type of content or message, which is retrieved from a remote
site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or
receipt of a web page, content or message.&nbsp; </span></p>

out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser (see above).
Please note that we do not tie clear GIFs to personally identifiable
information.</span></p>
