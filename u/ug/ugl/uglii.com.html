<h3>Cookies and other technologies</h3>
<p>
We collect activity information on our website through the use of "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there.
</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer by a webpage server which can then be accessed by our web servers.</p>
<p>We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services.</p>
<p>We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. We also use cookies to customise your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.</p>
<p>If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, you can configure your web browsers to refuse to accept cookies, however, this may mean you may not be able to make full use of our website as certain features of the SISS website will not be available once cookies are disabled.
</p>
<p><strong>Log files</strong></p>
<p>
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.</p>

We will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.
</p>
<p><strong>Click-through URL</strong></p>
<p>
In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the SISS website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
</p>
<p><strong>Pixel Tags</strong></p>
<p>
In addition, we use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.</p>
<p>Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read.  Pixel tags tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we're sending only messages that are of interest to our customers.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer.
