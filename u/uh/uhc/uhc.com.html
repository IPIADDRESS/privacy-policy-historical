<h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
<p>The Company uses various technologies, which may include "cookie" technology, to gather information from our website visitors such as pages visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on this website. "Cookies" are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website or click on a URL.
