</div>
<h3><a name="3"></a>With whom is non-personal information shared?</h3>

Similarly, we may hire outside companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers and software applications.</p>
<p>However, if we share or give access to personal information to outside companies we require them to use the personal information only for limited purposes, such as for sending you the e-mail in the example above. If you believe we or any company associated with the Company has misused any of your information please contact us immediately and report such misuse.</p>
<p>We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction.</p>
