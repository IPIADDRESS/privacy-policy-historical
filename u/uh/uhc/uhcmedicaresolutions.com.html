Health and medical information protected under HIPAA may be provided by you on-line or off-line, or may be collected by us from other methods such as from a health care provider. We protect covered health and medical information as required by HIPAA. Similarly, we may use covered health and medical information as permitted by HIPAA.</p>

        <h3><a name="2"></a>Cookies and non-personal information</h3>
        <p> “Non-personal information” means information that does not permit us to specifically identify you by your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a social security number, address, or telephone number. UnitedHealthcare uses “cookie” technology to gather non-personal information from our website visitors such as which pages are used and how often they are used, and to enable certain features on this website.</p>
        <p>You may disable these cookies by adjusting your browser preferences on your computer at any time, however this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website. Keep in mind that cookies are not used to collect any personal information and do not tell us who you are. Some examples of the way we use cookies include:</p>

          <li>Recording general site statistics and activity.</li>

          <li>Enabling certain functions and tools on this website.</li>
          <li>Tracking paths of visitors to this site and within this site.</li>

        <div class="backtotop_n"> <a href="#top">Back to top</a> </div>
        <h3><a name="3"></a>With whom is non-personal information shared?</h3>
        <p>Because non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. For example, we may share non-personal information with our affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents, other businesses, and the government.</p>
        <div class="backtotop_n"> <a href="#top">Back to top</a> </div>
        <h3><a name="4"></a>Personal information provided by you</h3>
				<p> “Personal information” means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, email address, postal address, or certain account numbers. As used in this Internet Privacy Policy, personal information does not include information protected under HIPAA, which is protected as described in the section “Medical and Health Information” above.</p>
         <p>This website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. <strong>You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this website.</strong></p>
        <p>We may combine personal information that you provide us through this website with other personal information held by UnitedHealthcare, our affiliates, or our vendors. For example, if you have purchased a product or services from us, we may combine personal information you provide through this website with information regarding your receipt of the product or service.<br>
        </p>
        <p>We may use personal information for a number of purposes such as:</p>
        <ul class="bullet_list">
          <li>To respond to an email or particular request from you.</li>
          <li>To personalize the website for you.</li>
          <li>To process an application as requested by you.</li>
          <li>To provide you with information that we believe may be useful to you, such as information about health products or services provided by us or other businesses.</li>
          <li>To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process.</li>
          <li>To protect someone's health, safety, or welfare.</li>
          <li>To protect our rights or take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
          <li>To keep a record of our transactions and communications.</li>
          <li>As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law.</li>

        <h3><a name="5"></a>With whom is personal information shared?</h3>
        <p>We will only share your personal information with third parties as permitted by this Privacy Policy (in its current or future form) and as otherwise permitted by law. We share and give access to personal information to our employees and agents in the course of operating our business. For example, if you sent us an email asking a question, we would provide your email address to one of our employees or agents, along with your question, in order for that person to reply to your email. We may share personal information with other UnitedHealthcare parent, subsidiary, or affiliate businesses.</p>
        <p>We also share and give access to personal information with other companies that we hire or collaborate with to perform services or functions on our behalf. For example, we may hire an outside company to help us send and manage email, and in that case we might provide the outside company with your email address and certain other information in order for them to send you an email message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire outside companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers.</p>
        <p>However, if we share or give access to information to outside companies we require them to use the personal information only for limited purposes, such as for sending you the email in the example above. If you believe we or any company associated with UnitedHealthcare has misused any of your information please contact us immediately and report such misuse.</p>
        <p>We may share personal information if all or part of UnitedHealthcare is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction.</p>

						<p>If you have health or prescription drug coverage through an employer or union, it is important that you talk with your group administrator before enrolling in this plan. Enrollment in this plan could either change how your current coverage works or terminate your group plan if your group coverage includes Medicare Advantage, Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug or a prescription drug plan. Even if your group coverage is with our organization, your enrollment in an individual prescription drug plan could affect or terminate your employer group coverage. In some cases, you may not be able to have your group coverage reinstated. To avoid potential disruption of your current group plan coverage, please discuss your intent to enroll in an individual prescription drug plan and ask your group to tell you what its rules are concerning individual prescription drug plan enrollment.</p>

				<div class="section_para1">
					<p>UnitedHealthcare would like to inform you about a privacy issue that affected the personal information of some applicants and members in our Medicare plans.</p>
					<p>On January 30, 2012, UnitedHealthcare discovered that a former employee, during the course of his employment, may have accessed information in a database in a way that was inconsistent with his job duties. We launched a comprehensive investigation into this incident. The results of our investigation indicate the unauthorized access appears to have occurred between June 28 - December 12, 2011. The database contained information such as names, Social Security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and Medicare Health Insurance Claim numbers.</p>
					<p>Individuals who were identified as potentially having their personal information inappropriately accessed were notified by U.S. mail on March 30. Our investigation also indicates the former employee appears to have inappropriately accessed the information of additional individuals. However, despite an exhaustive investigation, we have not been able to identify other affected individuals, resulting in the posting of this notice.</p>
					<p>We deeply regret any concern or inconvenience this incident may cause anyone. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our members' and applicants' personal information and are working to reinforce our policies and practices to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. UnitedHealthcare also has been in contact with law enforcement and hopes to see this individual prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
					<p class="fontBold">Steps to Help Affected Individuals</p>
					<p class="padding_top_0px">As a precaution, we are offering one free year of LifeLock<sup>®</sup> identity theft protection services to all those who may be affected.  This service includes:</p>
