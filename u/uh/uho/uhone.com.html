<h2>Website Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website. Portions of this website may describe privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific web pages.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “Company” refer to Golden Rule Insurance Company and/or UnitedHealthcare Life Insurance Company and its current and future affiliated entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group.</p>
<p>This website is intended for a United States audience. Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the United States.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Tracking </h3>
<p> The Company uses various technologies, which may include “cookie” technology, to gather information from our website visitors such as pages visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on this website. “Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website or click on a URL. Cookies may include “single-session cookies” which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and “persistent” cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire. </p>
<p> You may disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website. You may also manage the use of “flash” technologies, with the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/security.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flash management tools</a> available at Adobe's website. Note that we do not currently respond to web browser “Do Not Track” signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services because, among other reasons, there is no common definition of such signals and no industry-accepted standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
<p> We may also allow third party service providers to use cookies and other technologies to collect information and to track browsing activity over time and across third party websites such as web browsers used to read our websites, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our websites, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>, and to opt-out of such ad networks’ and services’ advertising practices, go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. Once you click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such advertising from all participating advertising companies or only advertising provided by specific advertising companies.</p>
<p> We may use analytics companies to gather information and aggregate data from our website visitors such as which pages are visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on our websites. Information is captured using various technologies and may include cookies. </p>
<p> We may use and disclose your activity information unless restricted by this policy or by law. Some examples of the ways we use your activity information include:</p>

<h3>Your Personal Information </h3>

<h3>Sharing Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this policy and as otherwise permitted by law. </p>
<p>We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction. </p>
<p>We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other visitors. </p>
<p>If you submit information or a posting to a chat room, bulletin board, or similar “chat” related portion of this website, the information you submit along with your screen name will be visible to all visitors, and such visitors may share with others. Therefore, please be thoughtful in what you write and understand that this information may become public.</p>
<p>We may also share personal information with other third party companies that we collaborate with or hire to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage email, and we might provide the company with your email address and certain other information in order for them to send you an email message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers and software applications. </p>
<p>This website may permit you to view your visitor profile and related personal information and to request changes to such information. If this function is available, we will include a link on this website with a heading such as “My Profile” or similar words.
