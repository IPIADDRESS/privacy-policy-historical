		We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. 
	</p>
		<p>
		We never sell or rent your billing or credit card information to any third parties under any circumstance. We will share customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for the limited purposes of fulfilling customer orders such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services and a shipping company to fulfill orders; offering certain products and services in connection with our Website; communication to customers; providing customer service via live chat software; enhancing and improving the customer shopping experience; providing a personalized shopping experience and completing credit card transactions.

In these cases, sharing your email address will not be required and the promotion will include specific information about how your email address will be shared.
	</p>
	<p>
		On occasion, we partner with other major companies whose products or services we feel offer the same high quality and standards as our own. In these instances our postal mailing lists are made available to them. While we carefully pick and choose whom we partner with, we understand perfectly if you prefer to hear from no one but us. To remain exclusively with us and not receive information about any other companies or their services, please call us at 1-800-333-8521, ext. 1 or e-mail <a href="mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com">helpdesk@tlavideo.com</a>.

		In the event TLA goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred.

		The security of your personal information is as important to TLA as it is to you. TLA uses a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLA has obtained a digital certificate from <a href="https://www.geotrust.com" target="_blank">GeoTrust, Inc.</a> When you enter a secure section of the TLA site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. The digital certificate guarantees that your personal information and/or sensitive information (such as a credit card number) is being transmitted to the secure and encrypted TLA Web server. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com">helpdesk@tlavideo.com.</a>
