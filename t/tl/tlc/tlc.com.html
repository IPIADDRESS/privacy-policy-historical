of manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable information on
the Sites: </p>

<ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">We may collect your email address, first and last name and zip code if you sign up for an online
 newsletter; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">We may collect your email address if you contact us with a question; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">We may collect your first and last name, your address, and your credit card and billing information if you make a purchase of a product at the Discovery Store. </li></ul>

<p>The above list provides an example of the personally identifiable
information that may be collected on the Sites. If you do not want Discovery to
collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to
us. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> </p>

<p>"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical
information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or
interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you
personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable
information that is collected via the Sites and a description of how this
information is used: </p>

<ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the
 Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Sites. </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a page within the Sites, a cookie is placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Sites
 previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites. </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or "pixel tags") -- "Web Beacons" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web
 pages. </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Demographic Information -- "Demographic Information" may be your gender, age, zip code and
 interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites. We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Sites meets your needs. For example, we offer personalized TV schedule listings and program
 reminders for Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Discovery Health Channel or any of our other TV offerings if you tell us which programs and
 topics you're interested in. Please note that we also consider aggregated 
information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information. The above list provides an example of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Sites. </li></ul>
<br>
<p><strong>B. Use of Information Collected Via the Sites</strong> </p>

<p>(1) Personally Identifiable Information We use your personally identifiable
information that is collected on these Sites primarily for the following
purposes:</p>

<ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">To deliver services, such as
 educational programs, information, newsletters or software you request or
 purchase; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To alert you to special
 offers, updated information and other new services from Discovery, or
 other third parties, or to forward promotional materials; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To complete a transaction or
 service requested by you; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To fulfill the terms of a
 promotion; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To ensure the Sites are
 relevant to your needs; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To help us create and publish
 content most relevant to you; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To notify you about a
 material change to this privacy policy or the Visitor Agreement, if
 necessary; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To allow you access to
 limited-entry areas of the Sites; and </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">To contact you in response to
 sign up forms such as Contact Us or Order Inquiry. </li></ul>
<br>
<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> </p>

<p>Non-personally identifiable information is used as described above and in
other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally
identifiable information with personally identifiable information (except with
respect to non-personally identifiable information collected from children
under the age of 13). </p>

<p><strong>C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</strong> </p>

<p><strong>(1) Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p> We may share or disclose your
personally identifiable information in the following instances: </p>

<p>(i) To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you choose to watch an
educational program on the Sites, we may share your personally identifiable
information in order to provide the program to you. In addition, if you email
us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and
respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest,
we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the
terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize
fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We also may share your information with
the co-sponsor of that promotion. </p>

<p>(ii) To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or
other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we
believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally identifiable
information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes.
These parties may use your personally identifiable information to contact you
with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use
such information for their own research, administration or business purposes.
If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information in this
manner, please do not provide us with this information. </p>

<p>(iii) To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent
contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative
services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and
fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data,
sending customer communications on Discovery's behalf, and entry collection,
winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other
promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not
use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to
provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because
such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our
Sites will have access to users' personally identifiable information, if you do
not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to
your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable
information to us. </p>

<p>(iv) To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase on the
Sites, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and
other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information
in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or
other personally identifiable information provided by you, to unaffiliated
third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process
your credit card). </p>

<p>(v) To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is
necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal
process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the
rights and property of Discovery and its family of Sites or act in urgent
circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users. </p>

<p>(vi) To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process
including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or
substantially all of our assets. </p>

<p>(vii) To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume
statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such
information to third parties. </p>

<p>(viii) To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties
the information collected from these Sites. In the course of such verification,
we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such
services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase
services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to
verify that your card information and address matches the information that you
supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. </p>

<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the
information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your
personally identifiable information to any third parties. </p>

<p><strong>(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> </p>

<p>We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Sites in the
manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal
information with third parties. </p>

<p><a name="children"></a><strong>D. Collection and Use of Information from Children
Under the Age of 13</strong> </p>

<p><strong>(1) Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Kids</strong>
</p>

<p>In most instances, Discovery will only request the first name and email
address of the child in order to complete an immediate request from the child.
The information that is collected will only be used for the requested purpose
and will be deleted immediately. Discovery will not store or otherwise use that
information. Here are some examples of instances in which Discovery may
immediately delete the child's information after the completion of the child's
initial request: </p>

<ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">If the child emails an
 inquiry; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">If the child participates in
 a game; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">If the child refers a game to
 a friend, we may request his or her first name and email address and the
 friend's first name and email address; </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">If the child wants to receive
 a postcard on one occasion; and </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">If the child sends a postcard
 to a friend on one occasion, we may request his or her first name and
 email address and the friend's first name and email address. </li></ul>

<p>From time to time, we may request limited personally identifiable
information from kids in order to offer a service, a promotion or other
activity to the kids. In such an instance, we will request that the child
provide his or her email address, as well as the email address of his or her
parent or legal guardian ("parent"). Discovery will use that email
address to send the parent an email letting him or her know about the child's
contact. The email will include details on how the parent may (i) provide
Discovery with consent; (ii) prohibit Discovery from any further contact with
the child; or (iii) delete the child's personally identifiable information.
Discovery will not collect more information than is reasonably necessary for
the child to participate in the activity at issue. </p>

<p>Below are some examples of instances in which we may collect the first name
and email address from kids on the Sites and require parental consent: </p>

<ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">If the child wants to enter a
 sweepstakes, contest or other promotion; and </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">If the child wants to receive
 newsletters on a recurring basis. </li></ul>
<br>
<p><strong>(2) Use of Personally Identifiable
Information Collected from Kids <o:p></o:p></strong></p>


<p>When we collect personally identifiable information from kids, we will only
use that information for the express purpose for which it was collected. For
example, if a child enters a sweepstakes, we will request the parent's
information (as described in Section D(1)) and will only use the child's email
address to enter the child into the sweepstakes, to notify the parent of the
child's entry, and to identify and notify the child if he or she is a potential
winner. The personally identifiable information will not be used for any other
purpose, and the personally identifiable information will not be used after the
promotion is complete. </p>

<p><strong>(3) Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Kids</strong>
</p>

<p>Except as provided in this Section, we do not share personally identifiable
information collected from kids with any unaffiliated third parties. We may,
however, share a child's personally identifiable information that we have
collected with parental consent in the following limited instances: </p>

<ul type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">We may share such information
 with third-party service providers who help Discovery maintain the Sites
 and provide other administrative services to us. We seek to ensure that
 these unaffiliated third parties may not use the personally identifiable
 information for any other purpose, and these unaffiliated third parties
 have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the
 personally identifiable information. </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">If your child is selected as
 a potential winner of one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will notify
 the parent, via the email address that the child submitted. If the parent
 consents, we will collect and share this information in order to fulfill
 the terms of the promotion. </li>

<li class="MsoNormal">Finally, we may disclose
 kids' personally identifiable information to third parties if we believe
 we are required to do so in order to comply with law (including court
 orders and subpoenas); to comply with requests from law enforcement
 agencies or the government; to enforce our Visitor Agreement; to protect
 our rights, privacy, safety or property and the rights, privacy, safety or
 property of our employees or other users of our Sites; to protect our
 operations; and to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the
 damages that we may sustain. </li></ul>
<br>
<p><strong>(4) Non Personally Identifiable Information</strong> </p>

<p>We collect and store the non-personally identifiable information that is
described in Section A2 of this privacy policy. We do not, however, link this
information to personally identifiable information when it is collected from
kids. </p>

<p><strong>(5) Note to Parents and Legal Guardians</strong> </p>

<p>Please contact Discovery at any time regarding privacy questions or
concerns, or to request to review what personally identifiable information we have
collected from a child. Parents may also contact us at any time to request that
we delete the personally identifiable information of a child or a parent and/or
refuse to permit further collection or use of a child's information. We will
take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for a child's information is
that child's parent or guardian. </p>

Discovery may transfer that information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or

 identifiable information for the uses identified above in accordance with

<br>
<p><strong>F. Opt-Out</strong> </p>

<p>We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a regular basis
via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request,
to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our
products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by
law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be
primarily informational in nature rather than promotional. </p>

<p>However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you
do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or
updates from us regarding new services and products offered on this Site or if
you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with third
parties. The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box
if such checkbox is available at the points where personally identifiable
information is collected or by contacting us. We will process your unsubscribe
as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may
receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may
opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe"
link within the text of the email. </p>

<p><strong>G. Forums, Chat Rooms and Other Public Posting Areas</strong> </p>

<p>Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any
chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with
Internet access. If you don't want people to know your e-mail address, for
example, don't include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY
CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC
POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. </p>

<p><strong>I. Third Party Advertisers</strong> </p>

to serve advertisements on the Sites.&nbsp; Please
be advised that such advertising companies may gather information about your
visit to the Sites or other sites (such as through cookies, web beacons and
other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or
services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and

more information about this practice and to know your choices please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.<strong></strong>&nbsp; PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER
THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING COMPANIES. </p>

<p><strong>J. Accessing Your Personally Identifiable Information and Privacy Preferences</strong> </p>

<p><strong>K. Assignment</strong> </p>

<p>In the event that all or part of our assets or sold or acquired by another
party, or in the event of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the
personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information collected
via the Sites. </p>

<p><strong>L. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong> </p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time. When
we do, we will also revise the "last update" date at the bottom of
this privacy policy. For changes to this privacy policy that may be materially
less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have
provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the
change by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your

<p>We will also notify parents if we change the kinds of information that we
collect from kids and materially alter our practices of sharing and using this
information. We will not collect, use or share the information without parental
consent. </p>

<p><strong>M. Security</strong> </p>

<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to
Discovery is done at your own risk. </p>

<p>Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure
security on our systems. We use firewalls to protect your information from
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please
note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server
software. </p>

<p>If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you
electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using
these Sites or providing personally identifiable information to us you agree
that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and
administrative issues relating to your use of these Sites. We may post a notice
on our Sites if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at
the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on
where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security
breach in writing. </p>

<p><strong>N. Age Screening</strong> </p>

<p>Some parts of the Sites require that personally identifiable information be
submitted in order to participate. For example, if you want to receive one of
our newsletters, you must give us your email address. Some parts of the Sites
will have an age-screening mechanism to prevent kids from registering. We won't
knowingly allow anyone under the age of thirteen to register with any of our
Sites, or to access those features that require registration, except as
explicitly disclosed herein. </p>

<p>If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable
information from a user under the age of thirteen other than in a legally
permissible situation, we will delete the information from our records as soon
as we discover it. </p>
