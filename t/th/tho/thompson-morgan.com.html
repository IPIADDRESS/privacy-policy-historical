<div style="margin-left: 18px; margin-right:18px;">

	<p>Thompson &amp; Morgan truly believes in keeping your confidential information just that - confidential! We will only use your personal information for the purposes of enhancing your Thompson &amp; Morgan experience. Registering with us allows you to take advantage of all our unique services as a Thompson &amp; Morgan member, including: receiving sneak previews of special sales and promotions and receiving customized regional gardening information.</p>

	<p><b>Security</b><br>
	Thompson &amp; Morgan has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Thompson &amp; Morgan' on-line transaction systems are built on Netscape's Enterprise Server, the leading solution for enabling secure Internet transactions. Always try to use our Secure Mode first when placing an order. You will not be able to use Secure Mode if you have an older version of an Internet browser that does not support secure transactions, or if your computer is located on a local area network (LAN) that uses a firewall that prohibits secure transactions. In the latter case, have your network system administrator configure Port 443 for secure transactions. If Secure Mode is not possible, use our Standard Mode or select one of our off-line order options (phone, fax, or check) to place your order.</p>

	<p><b>Order Information</b><br>
	Thompson &amp; Morgan uses an order form for customers when they request information, products, and services. When you place an order, we collect contact information (like your shipping and email address) and financial information (like your account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers, and to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Customers also have the option of ordering products over the telephone or fax, and may elect to pay by check.</p>

	<p><b>Use of Information</b><br>
	Thompson &amp; Morgan will not collect any personally identifying information except when specifically and knowingly provided by visitors to our site. Such information includes name, address, email address, and phone number.</p>
	<p>The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer we do not share your name and address with marketing partners, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:ccare@thompson-morgan.com">Customer Care</a>.</p>
	<p>Please note that if you have provided us with your <b>email address</b> we will not share this with any third party.</p>

	<p><b>Surveys</b><br>

	<p><b>Contests</b><br>
	Thompson &amp; Morgan may occasionally run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as email address or telephone number).
