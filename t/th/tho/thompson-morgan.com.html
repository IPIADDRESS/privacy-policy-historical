Thompson &amp; Morgan truly believes in keeping your confidential information just that â€¦ confidential! We will only use your personal information for the purposes of enhancing your Thompson &amp; Morgan experience. Registering with us allows you to take advantage of all our unique services as a Thompson &amp; Morgan member, including: receiving sneak previews of special sales and promotions and receiving customized regional gardening information.
 <p><b>Security</b> <br>
Thompson &amp; Morgan has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Thompson &amp; Morgan' on-line transaction systems are built on Netscape's Enterprise Server, the leading solution for enabling secure Internet transactions. Always try to use our Secure Mode first when placing an order. You will not be able to use Secure Mode if you have an older version of an Internet browser that does not support secure transactions, or if your computer is located on a local area network (LAN) that uses a firewall that prohibits secure transactions. In the latter case, have your network system administrator configure Port 443 for secure transactions. If Secure Mode is not possible, use our Standard Mode or select one of our off-line order options (phone, fax, or check) to place your order.</p>
