<p style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Please note that an advertiser may ask ThoughtSpot to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests).&nbsp; In that situation, ThoughtSpot determines the target audience and ThoughtSpot serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser.&nbsp; If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
