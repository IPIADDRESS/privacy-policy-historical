<strong>3. Third Parties Collecting Information Through the Services:</strong> The Services may contain content served by third parties, including videos and advertisements, and we work with third party service providers to serve advertisements on the Services and elsewhere online. In connection with providing content and services, third parties may collect certain information about you and your visits to this or other web sites and we may receive information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These advertising networks, advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your online browsing activities. Click <a href="http://www.tworoadshotels.com/privacy-policy#informationthirdparties">here</a> for additional information, including regarding certain opt-out choices available to you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a id="informationcollection"></a>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="registration"></a>Registration and Other Information You Provide</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services may collect "Personal Information" (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your full name or e-mail address), account information (password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your ZIP or postal code and information about your interests and preferences). If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services are general audience services and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals younger than the age of 13 through our online services. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information online from anyone younger than the age of 13, we will use commercial reasonable efforts to delete that information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="informationthirdparties"></a>Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We may receive information about you from third parties. We may combine this information in our database and we may use it to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Services, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="socialmedia"></a>Social Media/Integration with Third Party Platforms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services may permit you to interact with a third party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share" content from Services with other sites (a “Social Networking Service”). If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a Social Networking Service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services. Similarly, if you interact with us through a Social Networking Service, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third party site). Please note that if you mention or comment about us or the Services in your post to a third party platform, the third party platform may allow us to publish your post on the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on Services (such as posting a review or logging into the Services with your username and password for another site). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to use a social media tool available on a Service, you may be opting to link your activities on the Services with a third party site or service. That third party may collect information about your visits to the Services and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third party site. The information that we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party site.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To manage the information that we may receive about you from a Social Networking Service, you will need to follow the instructions provided by the Social Networking Service. Once we receive your information from a Social Networking Service, that information is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a id="usercontent"></a>User Content</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Services may provide you the opportunity to post content publicly through interactive features. You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, comments, photographs, audio files, video files, and suggestions related to the Services or otherwise post free-form comments (collectively, “User Content”). Please note that certain information, such as your name and state of residence, and a link to any website URL you provide may be publicly displayed by the Services along with your User Content. However, we will not publish your e-mail address or other contact information with these comments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Note that any User Content you post is public – others will have access to your User Content and may read, see, use, and/or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your User Content, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. If you submit User Content, it may be published online or offline (including through the Services, on-air, in a recording medium (such as a DVD), or any other medium or format currently existing or later developed). In addition, we may use your User Content and any excerpt from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity, and promotional activities.</p>
