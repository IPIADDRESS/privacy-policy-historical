<p>ThoughtWorks gathers information in two ways:

</p><p>(1) Indirectly (through our site's technology); and

</p><p>(2) Directly (when you provide information to us).

</p><p>One example of information we collect indirectly is information collected through our Internet access logs. When you access the ThoughtWorks website, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We may also record the URLs of the websites and pages you visit (before, during and after your visit to any ThoughtWorks Website), the times and dates of such visits, information about the computer hardware and software you use and other information that may be available.

</p><p>Additionally, we collect information directly from you in a number of ways, including through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information which save and retrieve information about your visit to the ThoughtWorks website for example, how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. However, if you are uncomfortable regarding the use of cookies, you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser.

</p><p>We also collect information directly when you voluntarily submit it to us. We may provide the opportunity to sign-up for a periodic email newsletter by entering in your email address.
