	<li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that  correspondence.</li>

This is  statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not  identify any individual.</p>

<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your  general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive  of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your  computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better  and more personalised service. They enable us:</p>

<ul>

  <li>To store information about your preferences, and  so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests.</li>
  <li>To speed up your searches.</li>
  <li>To recognise you when you return to our site.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the  setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies.

We will take all steps  reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in  accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which  enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for  keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with  anyone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the  internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your  personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our  site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your  information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to  prevent unauthorised access.</p>
