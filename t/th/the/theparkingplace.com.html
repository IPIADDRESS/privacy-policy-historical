<p>User Provided Information. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Sites or the Services. For example, when you open an account with TheParkingPlace.com, we collect certain personal financial information in order to properly process payments to you such as your billing address, bank name and address, and bank account number. </p>
<p>Third Party List Information. We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources. We may match this third-party collected information with the personally identifying information that you provide to us. When obtaining this information from third parties, TheParkingPlace.com seeks assurances from such third parties that they have the right to provide the information to us. </p>
<p>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology. We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Sites. For example, we and our business partners may collect and store non-personally identifying information through technologies such as log files, cookies, web beacons (also known as clear gifs), tracking pixels, and similar technology used by third parties to help determine user viewing preferences for advertising and other purposes. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Log Files. Technical information from your browser is automatically collected when you visit our Sites. This information includes your IP address, your browser type, operating system, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address. </li>
  <li>Cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using our Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Sites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Sites.

  <li>Web Beacons. We, or our advertisers, may use standard Internet technology such as web beacons (or "clear gifs"), tracking pixels, and other similar technologies, to gather aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about your use of our Sites.

This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of our Sites. </li>
  <li>Information collected by third-parties. We and our business partners, such as advertisers, may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and tracking pixels, to collect information about users who view or interact with these advertisements and connect to other websites.
