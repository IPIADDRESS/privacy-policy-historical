    <strong>As of May 26, 2017</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") outlines important information
    regarding you, the service user ("you" or "your") and the use and
    disclosure of your information collected via this Website and sub sites or
    the microsites of the registrant of the domain of the Website (the
    "Company", "us", "we" or "our"), and each of its affiliates and related
    websites or that our business partners or affiliates operate (the
    "Website"). We are providing you with this Privacy Policy to help you make
    an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website. By
    using the Website, you consent to the processing of your information as set
    forth in this Privacy Policy.
    <br>
    <br>
    PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE
    EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy; we
    may also undergo a change of ownership. Changes to the Privacy Policy will
    apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised
    Privacy Policy on our Website, as well as to existing information held by
    us. If we decide to materially change our personal information handling
    policies or practices in a material way, and if we seek to collect, use or
    disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which
    consent has been obtained, we will obtain the necessary consents that might
    be required by law. We will also notify you by means of a notice on our
    Website before the material change becomes effective. If any proposed
    change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we close your account,
    as described in the How to Contact Us Section. Your continued use of the
    Website, or your continued interaction with us (in correspondence and the
    like) after we have notified you of a material change to this Privacy
    Policy will be deemed an acceptance of these new terms.
    <br>
    <br>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the Company's collection, use, storage and
    disclosure of information by us on (a) the Website, (b) on various third
    party websites, and (c) to our other information collection, including the
    purchase of customer lists from third parties. We are not responsible for
    the information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or
    applications. By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is
    subject to the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any
    personal information you provide via the Website or through other official
    contact with us remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the
    Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.
    <br>
    <br>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we collect or receive
    from you and other individuals who use the Website, register on the Website
    or participate in the promotions or offers available on the Website; or
    with whom we communicate through email or other means.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1. Collection of Information.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    1.1 Survey Information. We collect information from you and other
    individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when you
    voluntarily complete our survey, order form, or a registration page either
    online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms,
    or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, "Survey").
    (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website,
    and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online,
    including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones,
    and other similar means.) In the Surveys, the Company or a third party (a
    "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to us,
    which may include your name, email address, street address, zip code/postal
    code, telephone numbers (including wireless phone numbers and wireless
    carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS
    message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status,
    occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and
    online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time
    to time (together, "Survey Information"). We may also collect information
    concerning you from another source and use that information in combination
    with information provided from this Website. Completing the Survey(s) is
    completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide
    Survey Information to us or a Third Party, but an individual may receive
    incentives from us or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey
    Information to us.
    <br>
    <br>
    1.2 Third Party List Information. We collect information from you when you
    provide information to a third party and we subsequently purchase, license,
    or otherwise acquire your information from the third party (the "Seller").
    Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, your name,
    email address, street address, zip code/postal code, telephone numbers
    (including wireless phone numbers and wireless carriers), SMS messaging
    details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date,
    gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of
    employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as
    the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List
    Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, we seek
    assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the
    Third Party List Information to us and that the Seller has a right to
    provide offers from advertisers to you (the individual whose personal
    information is included on the Seller's list).
    <br>
    <br>
    1.3 Other Information. Other occasions when we obtain your information
    include (1) when you make a claim for a prize or seek to redeem an
    incentive offered by us or by a Third Party, (2) when you request
    assistance through our Customer Service Department, and (3) when you
    voluntarily subscribe to our services or newsletters (together, "Other
    Information").
    <br>
    <br>
    1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology.
    We sometimes may use cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain
    Internet-related information about you with information about you in our
    database. Additionally, we may use other new and evolving sources of
    information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
    <br>
    <br>
    (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of
    your computer that allows us to identify you with your corresponding data
that resides in our database. You may read more about cookies at    <a href="http://cookiecentral.com/">http://cookiecentral.com</a>.
    Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all
    of the features and functionality of the Website.
    <br>
    <br>
    (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to
    display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer an
    individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to
    a database and associate the individual with previously acquired
    information about an individual in a database. This allows us to track
    certain websites you visit online. Web beacons are used to determine
    products or services you may be interested in, and to track online
    behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, we might place, with
    the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's
    website where baseball products are sold. When "Pat", an individual listed
    in our database, visits the fishing website, we receive notice by means of
    the web beacon that Pat visited the baseball site, and we would then update
    Pat's profile with the information that Pat is interested in baseball. We
    may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to
    Pat. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, we also use web beacons
    in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.
    <br>
    <br>
    (c) JavaScript. In order to determine the web browser you are using, to
    serve browser-appropriate content, and to optimize links depending on
    whether or not they have been visited by you, we may employ JavaScript
    which provides this information to us.
    <br>
    <br>
    (d) New Technology. If you visit the Website (even if you do not fill out a
    Survey), we will automatically collect information about your computer,
    smart phone, tablet or similar device ("Device"), such as the type of
    Device, operating system version, unique Device identifier, browser type
    and version, and mobile network information or log information (IP address,
    screen resolution, and referring domain) (collectively, "Device
    Information"). While an IP address does not identify an individual by name,
    it may, with the cooperation of an Internet Service Provider, identify an
    access point or a Device, which may in turn lead to the identification of a
    specific person. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies
    and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is our use of new and evolving
    technology. As a result, we strongly encourage you to revisit this Privacy
    Policy for any updates regarding our use of technology.
    <br>
    <br>
    1.5 Outside Information. We may receive information about you from Third
    Parties or from other sources of information outside of the Company
    including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
    <br>
    <br>
    1.6 Your Individual Information. As used herein, your Individual
    Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other
    Information, Technology Information, Outside Information, and any other
    information we gather or receive about you such as usage data, file
    transfer and viewing data.
    <br>
    <br>
    1.7 No Information Collected from Children. We will never knowingly collect
    any personal information about children under the age of 13 (a "Minor").
    The Website is not directed to Minors. If we obtain actual knowledge that
    we collected personal information about a Minor, that information will be
    automatically deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such
    information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to Third
    Parties. We have designed this policy in order to comply with the
    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). You may read more about
COPPA at    <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.coppa.org</a>.
    If you become aware that your child, a Minor, has provided us with personal
    information without your consent, you should contact us immediately.
    <br>
    <br>
    1.8 Log File Information. When you log-in to access your account, our
    servers may automatically record and archive certain information that
    web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may
    include information vital to validating your authorization to access the
    account. Information, such as a web request, Internet Protocol (the "IP")
    address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and
    visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order,
    time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is
    necessary to validate and authorize your entry and activity on the Website.
    <br>
    <br>
    1.9 Credit Card Information. We may in certain cases collect credit card
    numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card
    ("Credit Card Information") when you place an order with us. When the
    Credit Card Information is submitted to us, such information is encrypted
    and is protected with SSL encryption software. We will use the Credit Card
    Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase
    transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third
    Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Use of Your Individual Information.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    2.1 Discretion to Use Your Individual Information. WE MAY USE YOUR
    INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE
    DISCRETION. The following paragraphs in this Section 2 describe how we
    currently use your Individual Information, but we may change or broaden our
    use at any time. As noted, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to
    time. We may use your Individual Information to provide promotional offers
    to you by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail
    marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other
    possible uses.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.2 Email. We use your Individual Information to provide promotional offers
    by email to you. We may maintain separate email lists for different
    purposes. If you wish to end your email subscription from a particular
    list, you need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message
    to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all of our
    email lists, you must send an email to legal@theparkingplace.com.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.2(a) Content of Email Messages. In certain commercial email messages sent
    by us, an advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the
    "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to us. The "Subject:"
    line of our email messages will usually contain a line provided from the
    advertiser to us.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.2(b) Solicited Email. We only send email to individuals who have agreed
    on the Website to receive email from us or to individuals who have agreed
    on Third Party websites to receive email from Third Parties such as the
    Company. We do not send unsolicited email messages. As a result,
    legislation requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email do not apply
    to our email messages.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.3 Targeted Advertising.
    <br> <br>
    TheParkingPlace.com may use Individual Information to target advertising to an
    individual. When an individual is using the Internet, TheParkingPlace.com may use
    Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual
    with that person's Individual Information, and TheParkingPlace.com attempts to show
    advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an
    interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
    Information, and otherwise. TheParkingPlace.com may, at its discretion, target
    advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means
    of communication to provide promotional offers.
    <br> <br>
    If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may opt-out by emailing
    us at&nbsp;legal@theparkingplace.com, 
    or write to us at Customer Care, 1490 W. 121st Avenue, Westminster, CO 80234. 
    Please include your email address and phone number in the body of your email or 
    letter, and include "Opt-out" in the subject line.
    <br> <br>
    Should TheParkingPlace.com engage in interest-based advertising, it will endeavor
    to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral
    Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
    (http:///aboutads.info)
    <br>
    <br>
    2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing. We use your Individual Information to
    advertise, directly or indirectly, to you using direct mail marketing or
    telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.5 Mobile Phone SMS Messaging. In certain cases, when requested by an
    individual, a Third Party may use your Individual Information to provide
    customized content and advertising via SMS messaging to your cell phone or
    wireless device. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the
    content of such Third Parties.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.6 Use of Technology Information. We use Technology Information (1) to
    match your Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other
    categories of your Individual Information to make and improve your
    profiles, (2) to track your online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to
    determine which areas of our Websites are most frequently visited. This
    information helps us to better understand the online habits of individuals,
    including you, so that we can target advertising and promotions to you and
    other individuals.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.7 Profiles of Individuals. We use your Individual Information to make a
    profile. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third
    Party List Information with other sources of your Individual Information
    such as information obtained from public databases.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.8 Storage of Your Individual Information. We store your Individual
    Information in a database on our computers. Our computers have security
    measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse,
    and alteration of Individual Information under our control. Notwithstanding
    such measures, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
    our computers from being illegally accessed, and your Individual
    Information on them stolen or altered.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.9 Do Not Call Registry Compliance. By submitting your personal contact
    and/or financial information through the Website, you hereby grant written
    permission to the Company, its affiliated sites, and its business partners
    for contact via telephone, voice broadcasts, mail, SMS text message, and/or
    e-mail. Further, by registering on the Website you are consenting to
    receive phone calls from the Company, its affiliated sites, and its
    business partners for contact via telephone and thereby waive your right to
    file a claim with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or any other agency in
    reference to these calls or contacts.

    <strong>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons. Advertising agencies, advertising
    networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place
    advertisements on the Website and on the Internet generally may use their
    own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about
    individuals. We do not control Advertisers' use of such technology and we
    have no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information
    about you.
    <br>
    <br>
    4.2 Links. The Website and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links
    to the websites of Third Parties. We are not responsible for the privacy
    practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may
    contain links to websites maintained by Third Parties. Such links are
    provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not operate or
    control in any respect any information, software, products or services
    available on such Third Party websites. The inclusion of a link to a
    website does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its
    contents, or its sponsoring organization. This Privacy Policy does not
    cover the use of your personal or Individual Information by these Third
    Parties. We recommend that you review their privacy policies, which will
    apply to all of your activities once you have left our Website. In

    <br>
    <br>
    We will share your Individual Information with these third parties, only to

    <strong>7. Disputes.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>
        If you have any concerns or claims with respect to our data handling
        practices, please contact us first. We will investigate and attempt to
        resolve any complaints and disputes regarding our use and disclosure of
        your Individual Information. If your complaint or dispute cannot be
        resolved through our internal process, or if we do not adequately
        respond to your question, you agree to resolve your dispute through
        arbitration. If arbitration is necessary, it will be conducted by
        telephone and email, and if it must be done in person, it will be
        conducted in Denver, Colorado. The arbitration will be conducted by one
        arbitrator member of the American Arbitration Association, and under
        the rules of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration
        Association or as agreed between you and the Company. Both parties will
        bear equally the cost of arbitration (exclusive of legal fees and
        expenses). You acknowledge and agree that you and the Company are each
        waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff
        or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide
        arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other
        representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the Company
        otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
        than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
        of any class or representative proceeding.
    </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        All decisions of the arbitrator will be final and binding on both
        parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. For
        additional information you may contact
