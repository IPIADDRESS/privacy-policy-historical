At&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#privacyapproach">The Body Shop</a>, we recognise that the protection of your Personal Information is a very important principle in building trust and maintaining a good relationship with you. In this Privacy Policy the first person ("we", "our", "us", "ours") denotes The Body Shop International Plc or any of its subsidiaries all connected to The Body ShopÂ® brand (in short, "The Body Shop") responsible for the collection of the Personal Information and bound by this Privacy Policy. The second person ("you", "your", "yours") denotes you as the customer, or generally the individual providing Personal Information or any other information, being the subject matter of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>1.2. This Privacy Policy details our commitments and your rights regarding the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#processing">Processing</a>&nbsp;of your Personal Information in line with applicable legislation.</p>
<p>1.3. We are responsible for the Personal Information under our control, including Personal Information disclosed by us to a<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#vendor">Vendor</a>&nbsp;(often referred to as the data processor).&nbsp;<b>"Vendor"</b>&nbsp;in this Privacy Policy means in relation to Personal Information any person or entity (other than an employee of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#privacyapproach">The Body Shop</a>) who Processes the Personal Information on behalf of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#privacyapproach">The Body Shop</a>.&nbsp;<b>"Processing"</b>, in relation to Personal Information means for example obtaining, recording, holding or using the Personal Information anywhere in the world or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the Personal Information including (a) organisation, adaptation or alteration of the Personal Information, (b) retrieval, consultation or use of the Personal Information, (c) disclosure of the Personal Information by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, or (d) alignment, combination, blocking, erasure or destruction of the information or data; As a global business we wish to be able to communicate with our customers worldwide, and may have to process customer personal data anywhere in the world. This Privacy Policy complies with the highest legal standards around the world, and in particular, among others, with European data protection legislation, which generally sets some of the highest standards worldwide for the protection of personal data. If the Processing takes place outside of the European Economic Area (<b>"EEA"</b>, which includes all the countries of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), where the data protection laws may not provide an equivalent level of protection to those in the EEA, we will arrange for appropriate security measures to be in place to ensure a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information. In particular we will abide by this Privacy Policy when transferring your Personal Information outside of the EEA and will make sure that recipients of data transfers outside of the EEA are aware of this Privacy Policy and comply with it.</p>
<p>1.4. In certain specific instances, this Privacy Policy may also be supplemented by additional policies and terms, or by short Privacy Statements used in connection with particular purpose(s) or on various forms, which we may identify to be applicable.</p>

<p><a name="consent"></a><b>6. Customer Consent (Opt In â€“ Unsubscribe)</b></p>
<p>6.1. Opt In: We at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#privacyapproach">The Body Shop</a>&nbsp;will not use your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#personal">Personal Information</a>&nbsp;for a purpose that has not previously been specified, unless we have previously obtained your consent or unless such purpose is required by law.</p>
<p>6.2. Consent to provide Personal Information is not a condition for our selling a product to you, unless the information requested is required to fulfill an explicitly specified and legitimate purpose.</p>
<p>6.3. In particular we will generally seek your explicit prior consent (opt in) before sending to you marketing communications (see 5.1.2 above)&nbsp;unless the exception stated in section 6.6 below applies.</p>
<p>6.4. Unsubscribe: At any time, you can withdraw your consent to our collection, use or disclosure (generally&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#processing">Processing</a>) of your Personal Information by writing to us in the prescribed manner (whether by email or post, or by text messaging etc), as specified in our communications to you, or in relevant forms that you might have signed (e.g. for our customer loyalty scheme), and depending on the country, in which you live, or the channel by which you have previously agreed to receive our communications. If you have any concerns whatsoever, with regard to the unsubscribe functionality that we make available to you, pursuant to this section, please contact us at the address or medium shown in section 14 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>6.5. If you have previously opted into receiving commercial communications from us pursuant to 6.3 above, while also becoming a member of our loyalty scheme, should your membership to such scheme comes to an end for whatever reason, we will not take this to imply an automatic request to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebodyshop.in/about-the-website/privacy-policy#consent">unsubscribe</a><br>, and we will assume that we have your continued consent, unless you specifically unsubscribe, as is provided for in section 6.4.</p>
<p>6.6. Similar Products or Services (Soft-opt-in): In certain jurisdictions (including in the UK) it is permissible to send commercial communications by email even in the absence of explicit prior consent (opt-in) where the recipient's details have been collected in connection with the sale or negotiation for sale of products or services, irrespective of the conclusion of a contract, provided always that the senderâ€™s identity is clearly stated and an unsubscribe option is given. This is usually referred to as the "Similar Products or Services exception", or as the "Soft-opt-in rule". Where this rule applies we may rely on it in order to send to you marketing communications that we think may be of interest to you, but we will make sure that this is made clear and that you are given the opportunity up-front to opt out from receiving such communications from us, whilst you will also always be given the opportunity to subsequently unsubscribe pursuant to section 6.4.</p>

However, we may require you to provide us with additional information reasonably necessary for us to satisfy your request.</p>
<p>8.2. Responding to a customer request (under section 14 below) for information will usually be done at no or minimal cost to the customer. However, subject to the laws of any Relevant Jurisdiction, a fee for reasonable costs incurred may be charged in responding in writing, provided the customer is informed of the fee in advance, which will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by the legislation of the Relevant Jurisdiction. The Personal Information requested is provided to the customer in a form that is generally understandable.</p>
<p>8.3. We amend the Personal Information contained in our database or elsewhere as required when an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness of the Personal Information.
