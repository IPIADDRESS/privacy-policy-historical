Unfortunately, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and online communications, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on the Service or our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers. Your use of the Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk.</p></div><div class="header" data-reactid="119"><p>Other Websites, Applications and Services</p></div><div class="content" data-reactid="120"><p>As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party websites, applications and services from within the Service and the Service may carry advertisements for third-party websites, applications and services.
