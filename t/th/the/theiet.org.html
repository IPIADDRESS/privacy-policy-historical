                     </p>
                     <p>Its objectives are promoting the advancement of engineering, technology and science. It provides a range of services to both
                        members and non-members. The Institution is careful to protect the privacy of its members, other contacts and stakeholders.
                        This privacy policy sets out details of the personal information that the Institution collects about you, and the ways in
                        which it may use that information.<br><br></p>
                     <p><a id="whydata" name="whydata"><b>The data that the Institution requests and why it needs them</b></a></p>
                     <p>The Institution uses information collected from its members and non-members to enhance the services that it offers to you,
                        and to improve your experience on its site. It invites you to supply your personal data in order that it can process your
                        requirements and deliver the services that you have requested.
                     </p>
                     <p>Typically, the following details are required in order to send any products that you have ordered, or for event registration
                        purposes: name, address and other contact information. If you are (or are applying to become) a member of the Institution,
                        your personal data will be used to provide the members' services that you require. If you are seeking the MIET category of
                        membership, or you have asked for support in achieving qualifications under the rules of the <a href="http://www.engc.org.uk/">ECUK</a>, then further information may be required from you, (educational and employment history, plus the name of a qualified supporter)
                        in order to assess your application. The Institution will share some of your information with the ECUK in order to register
                        your Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer or Engineering Technician qualification. The Institution publishes a list of
                        new qualified members each month on its Web site.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Institution records the services, publications and other products that you have selected. If you contribute to the work
                        of the Institution, for example by serving on a committee, this will be recorded; the information may then be used to provide
                        you with access to any special services that the Institution provides to assist that committee. The Institution does not attempt
                        to collect personal information by methods that are indirect or not made obvious to you, and it does not attempt to combine
                        your information with data obtained from sources outside the Institution.
                     </p>
                     <p>Normally, when you order products or services through the IET Web sites, you will be invited to register a Web site log-in
                        account. You may also create a log-in account to gain access to services such as the Institution's Professional Networks,
                        to take part in discussions or to update your membership information. For Web site registration, you will be asked for your
                        name and email address, plus the country in which you live. This allows the Institution to know which of its events and local
                        member activities take place in your country or region.<br><br></p>
                     <p><a id="whatdata" name="whatdata"><b>What the Institution does with your data</b></a></p>
                     <p>The Institution protects the privacy of your information using secure servers. The information that you provide will be kept
                        confidential and used to support the Institution's relationship with you.
                     </p>
                     <p>Your details will be made available, as appropriate, to those officers of the Institution who are responsible for the services
                        that you request. Services such as Branch activities and advice on achieving qualifications are mostly delivered to members
                        by local volunteer officers. Publications and membership subscriptions are examples of services mostly delivered by the staff
                        in the main offices.
                     </p>
                     <p>The information that you provide may be held and used by the Institution for market analysis and production of internal reports,
                        for marketing its products and services generally and (subject to any objection or preference you may indicate when submitting
                        your details) for sending information to you about its activities, services and publications from time to time. Please see
                        the section below if you would like to change your preferences.
                     </p>
                     <p>From time to time the Institution may invite visitors to the Web site to provide data to improve the site, or its services
                        or marketing. Answering any questions will be optional.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Institution has a wholly-owned trading company, Peter Peregrinus Limited (<a href="http://www.ppl.co.uk/">PPL</a>). Major PPL and Institution of Engineering and Technology brands include Inspec, <a href="http://www.savoyplace.co.uk/">Savoy Place</a>, <a href="http://www.austincourt.co.uk/">Austin Court</a> and the <a href="http://www.teacherbuilding.co.uk/">Teacher Building</a>. The <a href="http://www.ieebenfund.org.uk/">IET Benevolent Fund</a> is a separate charity that offers services to members in need of special assistance. As appropriate, the Institution may
                        disclose your information to these companies, including their and the Institution's respective partners, agents and subcontractors,
                        for the purpose of delivering goods and services to you.
                     </p>
                     <p>When you make purchases at the IET Web Shop, or pay online for other services, you are using a partner company, WorldPay plc.
                        The Institution makes it clear on the payment pages that you are being transferred to the WorldPay site.
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Institution events are organised on its behalf by other organisations. When you register for an event, you will be informed
                        if the Institution shares personal data with a third party for the purposes of providing the event. There is information below
                        on changing your preferences at a later date.
                     </p>
                     <p>The Institution of Engineering and Technology Web site gives preferential access to some third-party services; often this
                        is restricted to members only. You will be told, when you register for a third-party service, that this will mean that the
                        Institution will need to share your data with the third party company before you can receive the service.
                     </p>
                     <p>If you choose to receive information from other companies and later decide that you no longer want to receive further information,
                        you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that, if you give any personal information to another company,
                        the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy. The Institution's privacy
                        policy will no longer apply.
                     </p>
                     <p>Otherwise, except for the purposes of law enforcement, regulation or legal proceedings, or with your explicit permission,
                        the Institution will not give or sell its members' and other contacts' personal information to third parties.<br><br></p>
                     <p><a id="tracking" name="tracking"><b>Tracking your behaviour on the Web site</b></a></p>
                     <p>A minority of the banner advertisements on the Institution of Engineering and Technology Web site may be from third party
                        advertising servers, and these may set cookies under their own policies, as indicated in our cookie statement.
                     </p>
                     <p>All Web servers log record each page request, together with the time and date, and the Internet (IP) address of the user who
                        requested the page. Except in the case of malicious activity against its site, the Institution makes no attempt to use an
                        IP address to trace an individual user. Where an Institution of Engineering and Technology Web site restricts access to staff
                        or students of particular organisations, the Institution may also test your IP address to determine whether it falls into
                        the ranges used by subscriber organisations for that service. Otherwise, the Institution uses server logs only to see general
                        trends, such as which areas of the site are popular, the most frequent paths that users follow, and so on. This helps to improve
                        the site for you in future.<br><br></p>
