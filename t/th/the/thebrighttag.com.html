<h2><small>This policy was last modified on and has an effective date of Dec. 19, 2013.</small></h2>
<p>BrightTag Inc. and its subsidiary companies (<strong>“BrightTag”</strong>) provides this Website Privacy Policy to share with you how we treat personal information about you that we collect and receive in connection with BrightTag Websites, features, or applications owned or controlled by BrightTag that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our <strong>“Website”</strong>).

<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Information We Collect</h2>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Information about you</h3>
<p>In general, you can visit our Website without providing us with any “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, or phone number). However, you may choose to submit Personal Information through our Website, and we may request other information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., your age, gender, ZIP code or similar information), payment information, information about your employer, and your preferences or interests. If we combine these types of other information about you with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You should know that we also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through our Website, we will treat the combined information as described in this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Our Website is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have in fact collected Personal Information from a user under 13, we will delete it.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Information about your visit to our Website</h3>

Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access our Website. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us with information regarding the physical location of the device you used to access our Website.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Web beacons</h3>
<p>We may also employ software technology known as “Web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Website is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you.

<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>

<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Information Access and Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information either through any online account feature offered or by contacting us.

In addition, at any time you can request that we modify or delete your Personal Information by sending an email to us at <a href="mailto:contact@brighttag.com">contact@brighttag.com</a> with the words “UPDATE MY INFORMATION” in the subject line. Please be aware that, to protect your security and privacy, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to making changes to your Personal Information. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Note, however, that information you update or change may persist internally or for our administrative purposes. It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases, and residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Links to Other Sites And Interactions with Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our Website may include links to third-party sites that we do not control. These third parties’ practices regarding information collection, use, and sharing may be different than ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party.</p>
<p>Our Website also may permit interactions between it and a third party Website, service, or other content provider, such as enabling you to “like” or share content to other Websites, features, or applications (which may include signing in with your username and password for the third party site or service). If you choose to “like” or share content, or to otherwise share information from or via our Website with a third party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Website (and we may have access to information about you from that third party). Your interactions with third parties through these types of social media features are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">When you Apply for a Job through Our Website</h2>
<p>If you apply for a job through our Website, we, or a human resources company helping us out, may ask you to provide self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender and ethnicity) in conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“OFCCP”), and similar state and local regulatory agencies. Providing self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide us with that information, we may submit it to the EEOC, the OFCCP and similar state and local regulatory agencies for business-related purposes, including responding to information requests, fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements and defending against employment related complaints.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Visitors Residing Outside of the United States and Consent to Transfer</h2>
<p>BrightTag is a United States company. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information you provide to us will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using our Website, or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States. You should know that privacy laws in the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Security</h2>
<p>We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure your Personal Information. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless connection, or electronic storage of data, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect. You use our Website and provide us with your information at your own risk.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Changes to this Website Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may change this Website Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes we make will be effective as soon as we post the modified policy on our Website. If you continue to use our Website after we post the modified policy, then you have accepted the modified policy and any information we collect or you provide after that will be treated as described in the modified policy. If we make material changes to how we use or share your Personal Information, those changes will not apply with respect to Personal Information collected or provided before we posted the revised policy without your consent.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as we do, by disclosing in its Privacy Policy that it provides consumers choice regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As we said above, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes if you have asked us not to do so. In case you forgot, here’s how you ask us not to: email us at <a href="mailto:contact@brighttag.com">contact@brighttag.com</a> (with “MARKETING OPT-OUT REQUEST” in the subject line).</p>

<h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">BrightTag Inc.’s Platform Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2><small>This policy was last modified on and has an effective date of Dec. 19, 2013.</small></h2>
<p>BrightTag Inc. (“<strong>BrightTag</strong>”) provides this Platform Privacy Policy to share with you how we treat personal information about you that we collect and receive in connection with providing our services to customers who license or otherwise use our technology and services (“clients”). If you would like to understand our privacy practices in connection with our Website and other services that BrightTag offers directly to visitors, please review our <a href="#WebsitePrivacyPolicy">Website Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Please read our full policy below but it is important to note that <em><strong>we do not collect any personal information on our own behalf – we collect information on behalf of our clients as service provider to those clients.</strong></em> We only store, use and share information collected through our Services as directed by our clients on their behalf.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Our Platform Management Service</h2>
<p>We use our proprietary tag management technology to provide data processing services (the technology and services together, our “<strong>Services</strong>”) that enable our clients to manage and control the collection of data derived from their Websites, mobile applications, and other sources of data (collectively “<strong>Data Sources</strong>”) and its distribution to various third party marketing and technology partners.</p>
<p>Our tag management technology includes an integration library file, SDK, or API, which will be placed on or within a client’s Data Sources by the client or by us in accordance with the client’s instructions. If the client directs us to, we will set, read, and modify cookies or other stored content objects on the browsers of visitors to the client’s Data Sources. As a result, data pertaining to those visitors (“<strong>Client User Data</strong>”), which may include Personal Information, will be collected by us on behalf of the client. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” includes information that identifies the user of a Data Source as a specific individual, such as the user’s name, mailing address, email address, or phone number.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">We’re Not Doing it for Ourselves, We’re Doing it for Our Clients</h2>
<p>BrightTag does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its clients’ Data Sources. We act as a data processor on behalf of our clients and not as a data controller in relation to any data that is collected, stored, processed or distributed as part of our Services. This means that we do not use the information collected for ourselves, we just collect, store and act upon the data for our clients. Each client decides what types of information to collect and to which third parties to distribute that information. Then, using the client interface included in our technology, that client instructs us to collect, store, process, distribute, or otherwise act upon that information.</p>
<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Our clients determine how they respond to any “Do Not Track” signal received and we follow their instructions in this regard when processing data on their behalf. Note, however, that there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<p>Each of our clients is responsible for establishing and complying with its own Privacy Policy and for providing any required notice, obtaining any required consent, and offering and processing any applicable opt-out or similar choice option.<br>
Our clients may instruct us to process a variety of Client User Data including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the client’s Data Sources;</li>
<li>Information about a visitor’s Web browser and device;</li>
<li>Information about visitor interactions with the client’s Data Source, such as content viewed and products purchased;</li>
<li>Information that visitors have provided to the client, including Personal Information and information about personal interests;</li>
<li>Demographic data, such as age, gender and location; and</li>
<li>Data that identifies a visitor’s Web browser and device to one or more third-party services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our clients or the third parties to which our clients instruct us to distribute collected Client User Data may use our service to collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across websites.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We only use the information we collect for a client to provide services to that client. We may store and process the information and we may transfer the information to the client or to a third party at the client’s direction.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
<p>We will not share information we collect with anyone except the client for which we collect it, a third party at that client’s direction, or under the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. Third parties who provide services to us may have access to Client User Data but only in order to perform the services we have hired them to provide.</li>
<li>Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose information, including Client User Data, to third parties: (i) to respond to subpoenas or other legal processes or if in our opinion the disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to respond to an emergency or otherwise to protect the safety, rights, property or security of any person or entity.</li>
<li>Business Transfers. BrightTag may disclose and transfer Client User Data: (a) if we assign our rights regarding any of the information to a third party or (b) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of certain of BrightTag’s ownership interests, assets, or both, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Security</h2>
<p>We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure Client User Data. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless connection, or electronic storage of data, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect.</p>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;">Changes to this Platform Privacy Policy</h2>
