<h2><a name="ourservices"></a>Our Services</h2>
<p>Signal is a service provider. We license proprietary technology and provide data solutions to our clients. Our services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of tracking tags and other code into client websites, mobile applications and other devices that allows clients and their various third-party marketing and technology partners to collect data relating to user interactions and interests;</li>
<li>Collection and distribution of data for the purposes of measuring the effectiveness of websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns and interactions with other marketing channels;</li>
<li>Management and storage of de-identified data that allows our clients to recognize their customers across devices and platforms, to better understand their customers and to engage their customers with more targeted marketing messages</li>
</ul>
<p>(the technology and services together, the “Services”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="datawecollect"></a>Data Signal Collects or Receives and Stores in Connection with the Services</h2>
<p>Signal does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its clients’ Data Sources. In order to provide the Services to our clients, we collect data from our clients’ websites, mobile applications, advertising impressions, email campaigns, retail stores and other sources (collectively “<strong>Data Sources</strong>”).</p>
<p>The information we collect or that clients provide us about their customers we call “<strong>Client Data</strong>“. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that identifies the user of a Data Source as a specific individual, such as the user’s name, mailing address, email address, or phone number or other information that identifies you as an actual person.</p>
<p>Client Data collected or provided in connection with certain Services (such as analytics), may include Personal Information but we do not use Personal Information in connection with any Services that assist clients with their interest-based advertising. Note that in providing the Services, we do not collect any Personal Information on our own behalf – we collect information on behalf of our clients as service provider to those clients. We only store, use and share Personal Information collected through our Services as directed by our clients on their behalf.</p>
<p>We do not use Personal Information in connection with advertising-related Services. For advertising related Services, we do use and store data that has been de-identified, which is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code that we cannot use to identify you directly. We combine this information with other de-identified information collected from or provided by other client Data Sources in order to help our clients recognize their customers and infer customer interests and preferences.</p>
<p>In order to provide the Services to our clients, we automatically collect certain information about your use of our client’s Data Sources when you visit or interact with those Data Sources (“<strong>Usage Data</strong>”). We collect a variety of Usage Data including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address and other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the client’s Data Sources (“<strong>device identifier</strong>”);</li>
<li>Information about a visitor’s Web browser and device;</li>
<li>Information about visitor interactions with the client’s Data Source, such as content viewed and products purchased;</li>
<li>Information regarding a user’s preferences and interests;</li>
<li>Demographic data, such as age and gender; and</li>
<li>Location information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We consider the following “Sensitive Data,” and we do not use this Sensitive Data in connection with interest-based advertising Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>racial or ethnic origin;</li>
<li>sexual preferences or practices;</li>
<li>criminal record;</li>
<li>health information;</li>
<li>genetic information that is not otherwise health information; or</li>
<li>biometric information or templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>We further limit the collection and use of sensitive data as defined and required by applicable law in certain jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions define sensitive data to further include:</p>
<ul>
<li>political opinions;</li>
<li>membership of a political association;</li>
<li>religious beliefs or affiliations;</li>
<li>philosophical beliefs;</li>
<li>membership of a professional or trade association;</li>
<li>membership of a trade union.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="techused"></a>Technologies Used to Collect Usage Data.</h2>
<p>We use many technologies to collect Usage Data. Some examples include:</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 2;"><em>Cookies and Local Storage.</em></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 2;"> Cookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit a Data Source. Cookies and local storage can both be used to store a unique identifier for your device that can be used to recognize your device whenever you visit a client Data Source. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable or decline cookies and local storage. You will need to check your browser’s settings for further information.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Web Beacons.</em></strong> Web Beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) that are included in our clients’ Data Sources.</p>
<p><strong><em>Embedded Scripts</em></strong>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with a Data Source. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server, is active only while you are connected to the Data Source, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p><strong><em>SDKs and APIs</em></strong>. SDKS and APIs are programming codes that collect information about your interactions with a Data Source. This code is installed on a Device, typically within our clients’ applications that you choose to download onto your mobile device.</p>
<p>These technologies, and similar technologies we may use, and the information they collect may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking your visits to Data Sources, monitoring how you navigate a Data Source and determining your preferences and interests for the purposes of serving you targeted advertisements and other marketing messages.</p>
<p>Signal may receive Client Data through certain technology or services that clients license through affiliated services, including those offered by Signal Digital, Inc., if the client utilizes the services of both companies. We use all information we collect and receive in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="purposes"></a>The Purposes for which We Collect, Hold, and Use Information</h2>
<p>We collect, hold and use information collected or received in connection with the Services to provide the Services, to improve the Services, for our internal business purposes, and to meet any legal requirements or needs.</p>

</ul>
<ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>In general, you can visit our Websites without providing us with any “Personal Information” (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, or other information that identifies you as an actual person). However, you may choose to submit Personal Information through our Websites, and we may request other information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., your age, gender, ZIP code or similar information), information about your employer, and your preferences or interests. We will also collect payment information if you choose to purchase products or services through the Websites. If we combine these types of other information about you with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You should know that we also may receive information (including Personal Information) about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Signal, that website will provide your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Third parties may also provide information about you in connection with our <a href="#Socialfeatures">Social Features</a>. We may also supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through our Websites, we will treat the combined information as described in this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you provide us with personal information about a third party, you represent, and we collect it on the basis that, you have that person’s consent for us to collect and handle their personal information in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We also automatically collect Usage Information as you visit and interact with our Websites, as further described below.</p>
<p>Generally, except as necessary for any application for employment (see below WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A JOB THROUGH OUR WEBSITES), or otherwise with your consent, we do not collect certain types of Personal Information (known as Sensitive Information) about you such as:</p>
<ul>

<p>We will assume that you have consented to us collecting all information, which is provided to us by you for use in accordance with this Website Privacy Policy, including any ‘Sensitive Information’, unless you tell us otherwise. Sensitive information will be used in accordance with the applicable law of your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Our Websites are not intended for use by anyone younger than the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children younger than age 13. If we learn that we have in fact collected Personal Information from a user younger than 13, we will delete it from our active databases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Socialfeatures"></a>Blog Posts, Public Comments &amp; Social Features</h2>
<p>The Websites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly through interactive features and through other communication functionality such as on the Signal Blog (“<strong>Public Comments</strong>“). Please note that certain information, such as your name, may be publicly displayed on the Websites along with your Public Comments, and that others will have access to your Public Comments and may use them or share them with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in connection with your Public Comments, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. To request removal of your Personal Information from Public Comments, contact us at privacy@signal.co. Given the nature of the Internet it is not possible to completely remove content as though it never appeared. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>Some websites and third party services also permit interactions between the Website and a third-party social network or other third-party website or service, such as sharing content or distributing a message on or through a social network, or enabling you to “like” or “share” Website content on a third-party service (“<strong>Social Features</strong>”). If you choose to share content or to otherwise post information through the Websites to a third-party site or service, or vice versa, that information may be publicly displayed. Both Signal and the third-party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Websites and the third-party site or service. In addition, Signal may receive information about you if other users of a third-party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party web site or interactive service. The information Signal collects in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party website or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information About Your Visit To Our Websites</h2>
<p>As described below, we and our third-party service providers may use certain technologies (such as cookies and Web beacons) that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you interact with our Websites (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Websites, any search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to our Websites, the areas within our Websites that you visited, and the time of day you visited our Websites, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access our Websites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us with information regarding the physical location of the device you used to access our Websites. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use Of Cookies, Web Beacons And Similar Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>We and our third-party service providers, including third-party advertisers and analytics providers, may use the following or similar technologies to collect Usage Information whenever you visit our Websites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cookies And Local Storage</h2>
<p>A “cookie” is a data file stored on your computer’s hard disk or similar device when you retrieve content from a Web server. Cookies may be stored on your device for different periods of time depending on how they are used. “Session cookies” store information that is only relevant for your current activity and are no longer accessible after you shut down your browser. “Persistent cookies” remain after you close your browser and may be accessed by your browser on subsequent visits. When you visit our Websites, both session and persistent cookies may be transferred to your device.</p>
<p>Certain Web browsers and certain browser add-ons such as Adobe Flash may provide additional local data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to cookies, and some of the content included on our Websites may make use of this local storage. For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. For more information about Adobe Flash and the privacy choices this technology offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.</p>
<p>Cookies, local storage and Flash cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, e.g., to identify your device when you revisit our Websites, to recall your authentication information, or to store information related to your navigation throughout our Websites, or to enable certain features on our Websites.</p>
<p>Your browser may allow you to refuse or remove some or all of these cookie and local storage technologies. For specific instructions, please consult the manufacturer of your Web browser software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Web Beacons</h2>
<p>We may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Websites is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Websites, to monitor how users navigate the Websites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How We Respond To “Do Not Track” Signals</h2>
<p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Like many websites and online services, Signal currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” Signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>
