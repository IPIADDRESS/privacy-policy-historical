    	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    	    <h3>We Value Your Privacy</h3>

       <p>FundersClub values your privacy, trust, and relationship.</p>

        <p>We are required by law to ask for certain information in order to perform our services for you,

            but we are committed to protecting your personal and financial information. This Privacy Policy

            answers some questions about what information we collect, what we do with it, and how we protect

            it. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal

            information and how you can access and update this information.</p>



                    <h2>Our Policy</h2>



                    <p>Welcome to the web site <a href="http://www.thefundersclub.com/" target="_blank">www.thefundersclub.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>")

                        owned and operated by FundersClub Inc. (Henceforward "<strong>FundersClub</strong>," "we," "us," and/or

                        "our"). This Site has been created to provide information about our company and its financial

                        matchmaking services (the "<strong>Services</strong>") to our users ("you," "your"). This Privacy Policy

                        sets forth FundersClub's policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data

                        ("<strong>Personal Data</strong>"), and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users

                        of the Services.</p>



                    



                    <p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices,

                            please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@thefundersclub.com" target="_blank"><i>privacy@thefundersclub.com</i></a>



                    </p><h2>Information We Collect</h2>



                    <p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and

                        other information from you, as further described below:</p>



                    <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you

                    voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services (for

                    example, contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address; and when you

                    wish to use certain Services (for example financial information such as bank account numbers, your

                    Date of Birth and last 4 digits of you social security number), or contact us with inquiries or

                    respond to one of our surveys. </p>



                    <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance

                        with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such

                        Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of

                        FundersClub and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</strong></p>



                    <p><strong>Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:</strong> When you interact with FundersClub through the Site or

                    Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information,

                    which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically

                    identify you. </p>



                    <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log

                        files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet

                        service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream

                        data. FundersClub may store such information itself or such information may be included in

                        databases owned and maintained by FundersClub affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site

                        may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total

                        number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain

                        names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the

                        Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services,

                        FundersClub often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on

                        the Personal Data and other information provided to us. </p>



                    <p>This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. FundersClub may share this

                        non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this

                        type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. FundersClub

                        may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and

                        prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>



                    <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of

                        information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the

                        Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site

                        usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you

                        to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a

                        visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data

                        except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the

                        toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you

                        are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies

                        turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p>



                    <p>The use of cookies by our any of our affiliates or service providers is not covered by our

                        privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID

                        cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and use our Services.</p>



                    <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>



                    <p>FundersClub uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy

                        Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in

                        connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email,

                        we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also,

                        if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your

                        Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such

                        services. We also may obtain information about you from third party sources to verify your

                        identity so we can properly process your requests and prevent fraud.</p>



                    <p>FundersClub and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your Personal

                        Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us

                        improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve

                        the Services. FundersClub and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with

                        you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.

                        If at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have

                        your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. Note however

                        that as user of the Service we will send you administrative communications that are reasonably

                        necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. , If FundersClub intends on

                        using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will

                        be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is

                        collected.</p>



                    <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>



                    <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in

                        this privacy policy. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with

                        you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with

                        certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>



                    <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In

                    the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data

                    may be part of the transferred assets and you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice

                    on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any

                    they need to perform their specific function. These companies are authorized to use your personal

                    information <i>only as necessary to provide </i>these services to us.</p>



                    <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> FundersClub may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or

                        services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal

                        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                        the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. Out of respect

                        Personal Data to FundersClub through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete
