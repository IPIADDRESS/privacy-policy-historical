While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. We use security protection software made by Oracle, as well as SQKL query protection.

This can usually be done on line with thefreebiesource.com.</p><p>Notification of Changes<br> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p><p>If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p></div> <br> <br></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div><div id="topbar"><div id="rss"><div><div id="topsearch"><form action="http://www.thefreebiesource.com/" method="post"><div align="right"> <input type="text" name="s" id="ls"> <input type="image" src="http://www.thefreebiesource.com/wp-content/themes/xplosive/xplosive/images/search_button.jpg" id="searchsubmit" value="Search" style="vertical-align: bottom;"></div></form></div></div></div> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery('html').addClass('pinwheel_slider_fouc');
