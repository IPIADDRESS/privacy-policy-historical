					<p>Privacy Statement</p>
<p>The purpose of this statement is to explain to you what personal information we collect and how we may use it.</p>

SC005830, having its registered offices at Courier Buildings, Albert Square, Dundee DD1 9QJ.<br>
DC Thomson is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the security of any personal information received from you. We strictly adhere to the requirements of the data protection legislation in the UK, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 and the Data Protection Act 2018 and we are registered on the Data Protection Public Register number Z5748964.</p>
<p>2. Definitions<br>

“Group Companies” or “Group Company” means any and all entities controlling or controlled by or under common control with Us. “Control” means ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting rights in such entity, and ‘controlling’ and ‘controlled’ shall have the corresponding meaning.</p>
<p>3. The Data Protection Officer (DPO)<br>

However, our information security manager will be happy to deal with any queries or requests regarding the data we hold about you. They can be contacted by email at privacy@dcthomson.co.uk or by post to Information Security Manager, D C Thomson &amp; Co Ltd., Courier Buildings, Albert Square, Dundee DD1 9QJ.</p>

When you register on our website, take part in a competition or place an order, we may collect your personal details which may include name, address,&nbsp;email address, phone number and other personal information that we will&nbsp;use&nbsp;to identify you,&nbsp;your order details and payment information. This allows us to process and manage your registration as well as process your order and provide you with the goods or service chosen</p>
<p>We do not collect sensitive information (also known as special categories of information) about you except when you specifically knowingly provide it and have consented to this. Examples are allergies in a situation where food maybe provided or a disability so we can ensure a venue can facilitate access.</p>
<p>We do collect some information from cookies and similar software which allows us to understand how you arrive on our websites, and use and navigate round them so we can improve the sites. We obtain some information from google analytics which is anonymous and other social media platforms for example Facebook. The social media information provided is limited and only that which you have previously agreed with them that they can share.</p>
<p>5. What we do with your Information<br>
We will use your personal information for a number of purposes including<br>
• To process your orders and provide our services, goods or online content, to provide you with information about them and to deal with your requests and queries.<br>
• For administration purposes which means we may contact you for reason related to goods or services ordered or online content you have signed up for, to let you know that a service or online site has been suspended for maintenance, if your subscription is about to expire to ask if you wish to renew it or if an online account has become dormant to ask if you wish to retain the account before we close it.<br>
• To provide personalised communications.<br>
• Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on our (and other) services, so we can offer a more relevant, tailored service. For example, if you view the sports page, especially football news, first thing each day, we can present this information when you first log in. If you have selected personalised emails through your DCT account (DCT Passport) you will receive specific email content, for example our business newsletter. You can opt out of any email services at any time by logging into your passport account or clicking unsubscribe on any received emails.<br>
If you do not wish a personalised service you can unsubscribe from this by amending your preferences in the DCT Passport or email privacy@dcthomson.co.uk.<br>
• A certain amount of advertising is tailored to the individual based on viewing and/or purchase habits. This is a common practice known as online behavioural advertising. You can find out more in What is online behavioural advertising.<br>
• We may show you relevant advertising on third party sites. See section 7 (on marketing)<br>
• To contact you about a submission you have made including any content you provide.<br>
• We use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to establish the number of visits from different countries, to limit/cap adverts of a certain type, personalise content and emails, and allow access to paywall protected content.<br>
• For analysis and research to improve our services and goods offered.<br>
• We may use and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.</p>
<p>6. What if I don’t provide some or all of the information requested?<br>
The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold but the main impacts may be:<br>
• We may not be able to process or fully process your order.<br>
• We may not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided.<br>
• We may not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have.<br>
• We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products.<br>
• We won’t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that mean nothing to you and are not related to your interests.</p>
<p>Withholding marketing consent. You are free to do this at any time. It will only stop you receiving marketing. It will not impact any other service/goods we provide you with.</p>
<p>7. Will You be contacted for Marketing Purposes?<br>
We use your personal information to update you about new products/services by post, email and SMS text message. We will only contact you with your consent. You will provide this either when you fill in a form to provide your data, by signing up for a newsletter, selecting your preferences in your online account or when you call us.<br>
We may personalise the message content based on information you provide us with, purchases you make and your use of DC Thomson websites.</p>
<p>We may use information which we hold about you to show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter). This could involve showing you an advertising message where we know you have a DC Thomson account and/or have used our products and services. If you don’t want to be shown targeted advertising messages from us, some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers on that site in future. If you want to stop personalised services from DC Thomson, including targeted advertising messages on third party sites you can do so by amending your preferences in the DCT Passport or email privacy@dcthomson.co.uk.</p>
<p>You are entitled to withhold this consent and opt out from receiving such communications at any time by not giving your consent on the form (paper or web) that collects your details or telling the operator when you call. You can also update these options by logging into your account (if you have one) and adjusting your preferences, contacting us by email at privacy@dcthomson.co.uk or by post to Information Security Manager, D C Thomson &amp; Co Ltd., Courier Buildings, Albert Square, Dundee DD1 9QJ. We will always provide you with a way of opting out of receiving future marketing messages from us, each time we send them to you.</p>
<p>8. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?<br>
There are a number of ground we process your data under. These are<br>
• Contractual – we need the information to preform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.<br>
• Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a product e.g. a product recall.<br>
• Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in DC Thomson interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals.<br>
• Consent – where you have given us consent to market to you.</p>
<p>9. DCT Passport and other DCT online accounts<br>
DCT Passport is an account management service for the DCT media online brands. This allows you to manage personal information, email subscription/preferences and access Pagesuite paid for content. It currently covers the newspapers and mature magazine titles, our travel sites and the online shops.<br>
Other online accounts that are for a single brand (not part of the DCT passport) will only allow you to impact your interactions with that one brand.</p>
<p>10. Internal Sharing<br>
As a Beano enthusiast you may have signed up for a Beano comic subscription or to the Beano website or both. The comic is produced by DC Thomson media (our publishing arm) and the website along with other online and offline activities are run by the DC Thomson company known as Beano Studios.

<p>11. Sharing your Information with Third Parties<br>
We may from time to time provide your personal information to third parties for the purposes of providing you with our goods and services. These third party providers include payment processors, providers of card validation services, credit referencing providers, third party sales processor (includes fulfilment services) and service providers who assist us with hosting our marketing campaigns. They do not decide what is done with your data and only process it on our behalf. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area; however we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information at all times.</p>
<p>When transferring any personal information outwith the EEA we only do so under one of the legally recognised transfer mechanisms for ensuring the data is safeguarded. These are:<br>
• The country in question has been deemed safe for data transfer by the European Commission. Also known as an adequacy finding.<br>
• The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data.<br>
• Binding corporate rules – this is where a large company’s own internal processes for international data transfer have been signed-off and agreed by the European Commission as safeguarding the data.<br>
• If the data is going to the USA it can be safely transferred to a company that is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.<br>
• Appropriate certification schemes</p>

You are entitled to withhold this consent and opt out from receiving such third party communications at any time by not giving your consent on the form (paper or web) that collects your details or telling the operator when you call.
