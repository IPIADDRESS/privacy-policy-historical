<p><strong>Third Party Websites/Social Networking Sites</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to use any third party website or service that is integrated with The Roar, including a third party social networking or blogging site, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (“Third Party Websites”)— or if you use any The Roar application provided through any Third Party Website — we may receive Information, including Personally Identifying Information, from such Third Party Websites, including, but not limited to:</p>

<li>Any Information That Is Publicly Available on Third Party Websites</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, The Roar may offer the ability to use certain Third Party Websites to facilitate your registration on The Roar. We may also use information about your profile and connections on Third Party Websites to allow you to share or connect with your friends and contacts on The Roar or to personalise your experience. In addition, The Roar offers “plug ins” and “widgets” from various Third Party Websites that allow you to share The Roar content off of our service.</p>
<p>Your decision to use, or share with, a Third Party Website when accessing or using The Roar products and services is completely voluntary. The Roar is not responsible for compliance with the policies or practices of any Third Party Website. You should ensure that you are comfortable with the information such Third Party Websites may make available to The Roar by reviewing those Websites’ privacy policies and service terms, and by modifying your privacy settings and preferences on those Services.</p>
<p>Any information we receive from Third Party Websites will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use This Information?</strong></p>
<p>We use the Information we obtain from or concerning you or your computer or device to provide The Roar products and services, fulfil your requests, improve our products and services, personalise and tailor your experience on The Roar, operate our business, and understand how users are engaging with The Roar.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use Information from or concerning you or your computer or device to facilitate the delivery of content or advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you about new or existing products and services or special offers. For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and services to the email address associated with your account if you subscribed to the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Roar’s Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>The Roar may place “cookies” on your computer or device that may contain anonymous Information that is associated with you. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize users, and are typically placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain (here, The Roar) that issued the cookie to you or that, in some cases, can be read by a third party domain.</p>
<p>Our cookies may record Information about your use of The Roar so that we can provide a continuous and more personalised experience for you, including for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify visitors; assess usage patterns; identify preferences; control the display of ads; diagnose problems with our servers; gather demographic information; analyse trends and usage patterns; conduct research; deliver editorial content; record registration and personalised information; and otherwise administer The Roar products and services.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to have The Roar place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse cookies before accessing The Roar. The Roar is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of The Roar that depend on cookies.</p>
<p>The Roar does not control and is not responsible for the use of cookies by its third party partners or advertisers. The use of cookies by some of these third parties is discussed below (see “Third Party Advertisements” and “Analytics Services”).</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing and Modifying Your Personally Identifying Information</strong></p>
<p>We offer several ways for you to update Personally Identifying Information that is obtained and stored by The Roar, or to change your account preferences on The Roar:</p>
<p>If you have an online account with The Roar, you can log in and update or change your account information<br>
You may unsubscribe to any of our e-mail updates or products by following the unsubscribe instructions in the body of any message<br>
You may contact us using our contact form.<br>

<p>The Roar may disclose Information (including Personally Identifying Information) from or concerning you or your computer or device to third parties in the circumstances described below. By visiting, accessing, attending or using The Roar’s products, services or events, you consent to the disclosure of your</p>
<p>Information to certain categories of third parties in the manner described below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the policies or practices of any of these third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>The Roar relies on third party vendors and service providers to provide support and assistance for its products, services and events (“Service Providers”), and we may disclose your Information (including Personally Identifying Information) to these Service Providers to the extent necessary to support our products, services or events, or as otherwise set forth below.</p>
<p><strong>Web Hosts</strong></p>
<p>The Roar’s website services are hosted by Bulletproof, an enterprise web hosting provider. All Information obtained and stored by The Roar’s websites ( see What Types of User Information Does The Roar Obtain?) is processed and stored on servers that are owned and operated by Bulletproof.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>The Roar offers the ability to share The Roar content on Third Party Websites, including social networking and blogging services such as LinkedIn or Facebook, through “plugins” or “widgets” (such as LinkedIn’s “in” button or Facebook’s “Like” button). When you elect to share content and information with others on Third Party Websites, The Roar may transmit your Information (including Personally Identifying Information) to such Third Party Websites. This Information may be visible on the Third Party Website to anyone who has access to that content or Information. Your decision to share information in this manner is completely voluntary. You should ensure that you are comfortable with how Third Party Websites may share your Information by reviewing their privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly on those Third Party Websites.</p>
<p><strong>URL/Referrer Header Information</strong></p>
<p>When you visit The Roar websites, certain information about the content or activities you have engaged in on The Roar may be reflected in the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) for the page you are viewing on The Roar (i.e., the Internet “address,” commonly displayed in the browser window). For example, the date or title of an article you are viewing may appear in the URL for that page. In addition, if you are logged into a The Roar account, certain account information may be visible in the URL when you visit your account on The Roar. If you leave The Roar to visit a third party website, including when you click on an advertisement or link or when you share information through a social plug-in, the information contained in the URL may be transmitted to the third party website by your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisers and Analytics Services</strong></p>
<p>As discussed in (“Third-Party Advertising on The Roar”), The Roar uses third party advertisers, including ad networks, to provide advertising on its websites. In addition, as discussed in (“Analytics Services”), The Roar uses third party analytics products to obtain information about how users are using and interacting with The Roar. These third parties may receive Information (including Personally Identifying Information) from The Roar as discussed in greater detail in (“Security and Protection of Personally Identifying Information”).</p>
<p><strong>Law Enforcement/Legal Process</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your Information (including Personally Identifying Information) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with any law, regulation or legal request; enforce, apply, or investigate breaches of our terms of use and other agreements; respond to public requests; or protect the rights, property, user experience or safety of The Roar, our employees, our users, or others. This can include exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Comments and Public Posts; Sharing on Third-Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>The Roar encourages active participation by users, including through comments and articles on The Roar. However, please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Information, personal or otherwise, on The Roar, that Information can be viewed, collected and used by others, including other users, search engines, advertisers, third party applications developers, and anyone with access to The Roar. The Roar has no control over the use, collection or disclosure of any Information that you post publicly on The Roar.</p>
<p><strong>Change of Control</strong></p>
<p>If The Roar, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by another company or party, user Information will be one of the assets transferred or acquired by the purchaser. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any purchaser of The Roar or its assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your Information as set forth in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Advertising on The Roar</strong></p>
<p>The Roar may allow third party advertising serving companies, including ad networks (“Advertisers”), to display advertisements or provide other advertising services on The Roar. These third party Advertisers may use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognise your computer or device and/or to collect and record demographic and other Information about you, including your activities on or off The Roar. These techniques may be used directly on The Roar. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and that browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques.</p>
