For each visitor to our web page, our web server automatically recognizes the

You can voluntarily chose to become a registered member.  In doing so,
we collect the name, e-mail address, city, state, zip code, date of birth,

addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, and profile
information volunteered by the consumer.<br><br>

The information we collect is used for internal review and to improve
the content of our web page. The information we collect is not shared
with other persons, companies, or organizations except when required
by a law enforcement agency in the process of a criminal investigation.<br><br>

<b>Do you use cookies?</b><br>
We use cookies to store certain information about registered members,
visitors preferences, and to customize web page content based on the
visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.  All cookies
are encrypted so they can't be used by another website.<br><br>

All of the information collected remains confidential and is not
shared with anyone other than the web site administrators. All of our

policy.
We do not sell your personal information, but we do use it for
marketing
purposes. We send newsletters and other important system messages via
email, but you have the option of not receiving these messages. You
also have the option of which information is shared publicly in your
profile. This information is used for internal marketing purposes and
to provide services to our members.<br><br>

<b>Do you partner with ad services which may collect information about me?</b><br>
While we may partner with some ad services from time to time, they will
only have access to information you consent to provide them.<br><br>

<b>What will happen if this privacy policy changes?</b><br>
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated
uses not previously disclosed in this privacy notice. If our information
practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes
to our web site and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.
If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back
at our web site periodically. For these new purposes, we will use only data 
collected from the time of the policy change forward.<br><br>

<b>Can I find out what information you have about me?</b><br>
Upon request we provide site visitors with access to all information
[including proprietary information] that we maintain about them, including
unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password) that we
maintain about them, transaction information (e.g., dates on which
customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) that we maintain
about them, contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that
we maintain about them, and a complete description of all of the information
that we maintain about them.<br><br>
