Examples of Social Features include "liking" or "sharing" our content and otherwise connecting our Services to a Third-Party Service. You may also interact with content on our Services, such as comics and podcasts, through platforms that host or embed them through our Services. These Third-Party Services may share the information they collect with us. We do not control the information that these Third-Party Services collect when you use their tools, nor do we control how the third parties that operate the Third-Party Services use any information they collect. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before using their tools, which can be found at their respective sites. If you'd prefer that these Third-Party Services not collect information about the content you share and use, we suggest that you not use their tools. Also, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references our Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with First Look in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with our Services. To help us understand how users are using our Services and to help us improve our Services, we may deploy our own analytics engine in addition to engaging third-party analytics Service Providers to collect aggregate information on our audience and how our audience uses our Services (for example, information on traffic to various pages within our Services). These Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Services, compiling statistic reports on the Service's activity, and providing other services relating to Services activity and other internet usage. We may use services to provide shortened uniform resource locators (URLs: the "addresses" of individual web pages) so our content can be shared more easily. These services collect information as our shortened URLs are shared and clicked on and may make some of that information available to us.We may also engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on Third-Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to tailor ads to your interests based on your browsing of the Services and elsewhere on the internet, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising ("<!-- /react-text --><strong data-reactid="245"><!-- react-text: 246 -->Interest-based Advertising<!-- /react-text --></strong><!-- react-text: 247 -->"), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). In addition, we may serve ads on third party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our data bases ("<!-- /react-text --><strong data-reactid="248"><!-- react-text: 249 -->Matched List Ads<!-- /react-text --></strong><!-- react-text: 250 -->"). This is done by matching common factors between our data bases and the data bases of Third Party Services. For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Facebook or Twitter. If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out with us from such list. If you opt-out from our Facebook Matched List Ads, we will remove the matching personally identifiable information from that list, however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple emails or other accounts you may have to opt-out separately for each one. To opt-out of Matched List Ads on Twitter services, visit the DAA’s opt-out website and app as further specified in “Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies” below. We are not responsible for such third-party services' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions. To the extent we combine information from Third-Party Services with personally identifying information we collect directly from you on the Services, we will treat the combined information as personally identifying information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, the information collected and stored by third parties remains subject to their policies and practices, including whether they continue to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible to others on Third-Party Services. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties or Third-Party Services and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

In addition, we may serve ads on third party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our data bases (\\\"Matched List Ads\\\"). This is done by matching common factors between our data bases and the data bases of Third Party Services. For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Facebook or Twitter. If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out with us from such list. If you opt-out from our Facebook Matched List Ads, we will remove the matching personally identifiable information from that list, however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple emails or other accounts you may have to opt-out separately for each one.
