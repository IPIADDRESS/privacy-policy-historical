<h3><br>Hbc is protecting your privacy</h3>

For over 330 years, Hudson's Bay Company (Hbc) has been a name that means trust in this country. We value you as our customer, and want to assure you that our 70,000 associates are committed to upholding the trust you've placed in us as Canada's oldest corporation and largest department store retailer.<br>
<br>
Hbc's Protection of Personal Information Principles was created to ensure we preserve the confidentiality, accuracy and security of your personal information. These principles guide us in the collection, use, retention and disclosure of your personal information in all of our Hbc family of stores and services: the Bay, Zellers, Home Outfitters, Shop.Hbc.com, Hbc Credit and Hbc Rewards.

<h4>What is Personal Information?</h4>
Personal information means any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, birth date, purchase information or e-mail address. As a customer, you provide Hbc with this information in a variety of ways, such as applying for an Hbc Credit Card, enrolling in our Hbc Rewards program, entering in-store contests, signing up for our Gift Registry program, or using our Shop.Hbc.com online shopping service. In every case, Hbc adheres to strict guidelines when dealing with your personal information.

<h4>Collecting your Personal Information</h4>
<ul>
<li>When you provide Hbc with personal information, we inform you as to why we are collecting it.</li>
<li>Hbc obtains your consent for the collection of your personal information. In some instances, where the purpose for collection is obvious, your consent is implied.</li>
<li>Hbc asks for your permission to collect additional information that may be useful in serving you in the future.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Using and Disclosing your Personal Information</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hbc only uses and discloses your personal information for the marketing purposes identified to you when your consent was obtained.</li>
<li>Hbc does not provide your personal information for marketing purposes of other organizations without your consent.</li>
<li>You can withdraw your consent for the use of your personal information at any time, subject to legal restrictions and upon reasonable notice to Hbc. We will let you know of the implications of withdrawing your consent. Information may be retained by Hbc for audit or archival purposes.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Maintaining and Safeguarding your Personal Information</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hbc strives to ensure that our security measures protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, disclosure, use or modification of your personal information.</li>
<li>Hbc limits access to your personal information to those Hbc associates who may need it for use in accordance with Hbc's established privacy principles.</li>
<li>Hbc associates sign an annual Code of Conduct, which requires them to keep your personal information confidential and comply with our security standards.</li>
<li>Hbc keeps your information for as long as necessary and in order to service you better.</li>
</ul>


<h4>You are Entitled to Access your Personal Information</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you request access to your personal information, Hbc responds to your request within 30 days.</li>
<li>There is no cost for reasonable requests unless you require copies of records. Hbc advises you of the cost, if any, prior to copying those records.</li>
<li>Hbc may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be separated from the records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, or is protected by legal privilege.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hbc Provides you with the Answers</h4>
Hbc has established a Privacy Office and has appointed two senior executives as privacy officers to ensure that everyone at Hbc complies with our Protection of Personal Information Principles. Hbc investigates and responds to any questions, complaints or requests for information you may have.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> What is "personal information"?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> "Personal information" is any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as a person's name, address and home phone number.<br>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Q: </strong>Do I have to give Hbc my personal information in order to conduct business with Hbc?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> There are several instances where you are required to give us your personal information for operational and/or administrative purposes.  For example, we require your personal information in order to manage your Hbc credit or Hbc Rewards account, deliver an item to you that you may have purchased, or maintain your gift registry.  Giving us your personal information for these kinds of <i>primary</i> operational purposes is necessary to obtain certain products and services from Hbc.

<br><br>

However, agreeing to the use of your personal information for additional <i>secondary</i> marketing purposes is entirely up to you.  You may contact our Privacy Office at any time to request that we not use your personal information for marketing purposes.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Q: </strong>What are the differences between primary and secondary purposes of personal information collection?<br>
<strong>A:</strong><i> Primary</i> purposes are those purposes that are operational and are absolutely necessary for Hbc to be able to provide the products and/or services that you request from us.  For example, a primary purpose for our collecting your address may be to ensure we can successfully deliver to your home an item you may have purchased. <br>
<br>
<i>Secondary</i> purposes are any purposes that are over and above the primary/operational purposes, like sending you communications that may include notifications of sales, special events, store promotions and other exclusive offers. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Q:</strong> Will I be advised of the collection purposes prior to giving my consent?<br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes. When you fill out an Hbc form that asks for your personal information (e.g. credit card enrollment form, gift registry form, Hbc Rewards enrollment form, etc.) there is a privacy notice that outlines both our <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> purposes for collecting your information.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Q:</strong> Why is it important to keep Hbc up to date with regards to my personal information?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Keeping your personal information as accurate and up-to-date as possible ensures that you will get the best possible information and service offerings from Hbc.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Q:</strong> What are my opt-out choices?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> You can opt-out of receiving communications via specific contact channels.  For example, you can choose to no longer receive marketing-related phone calls, but you may choose to continue receiving notification of sales and exclusive offers in the mail. 
You cannot restrict your communications to specific programs.  For example, you cannot choose to opt-out of Hbc Rewards-related offers, and still continue to receive credit-related offers. <a href="#contact">Contact our Privacy Office</a> for more details on your opt-out choices. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Q: </strong>If I opt-out, how long will it take to stop receiving marketing materials after I contact you?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Many will stop immediately or within days, while others may take longer.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Q: </strong>May I review the personal information Hbc has about me?  Can I obtain copies of that information?<br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes. You can review the personal information we have about you on file by <a href="#contact">contacting our Privacy Office</a>. There is no cost for reasonable requests for access to your personal information, but there may be a fee to supply you with copies of records.  We will advise you of the fee, if any, at the time of your request.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li> <strong>Q: </strong>Where can I get a copy of Hbc's Customer Privacy Brochure?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> There are three ways you can obtain our Customer Privacy Brochure:
<ul>
<li>Visit the customer service desks at any of the Hbc family of stores</li>
