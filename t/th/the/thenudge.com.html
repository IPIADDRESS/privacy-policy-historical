	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><a href="http://www.theNudge.com">www.theNudge.com</a> (“the Nudge” or “the Website”) is owned and operated by Framework  (London) Ltd (“the Company”, “we” or “us”).</p>
	<p> The  Company is very protective of its users’ privacy – its aim is to circumvent any  concerns you may have regarding privacy through both this Policy (as detailed  below) and the very simple privacy settings found within each user’s account.  There are two user settings – private or public.</p>
	<p> In  accessing and using the Nudge, you become a “User” and are therefore agreeing  to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, as well as permitting us to  collect and use your personal data in the manner detailed below.</p>
	<p>        <strong>Personal Data</strong></p>
	<p>	  We consider  “Personal Data” to be any information that identifies a User, including both  information provided to the Nudge by that User (such as their&nbsp; name, address, telephone number, e-mail  address, date of birth, gender, location) and any information regarding that  user’s movements on, and use of, the Nudge.</p>
	<p> Personal Data does  not include “Grouped Information”, which is information we collect relating to  groups of places, products, services, events, online content or customers, from  which User identities have been removed. In other words, information about how  you use the Nudge may be collected and combined with information about how  other Users are using it, allowing us to improve the Nudge for everyone. </p>
	<p> If you elect to have a private profile in  your settings then only those Users in your network will know which Nudges have  been added, specifically, by you. If you elect to have a public profile then  any other User will be able to “follow” your Nudges, and so will know which  Nudges you have provided, and be able to search them as they can those of any  Users within their private network on the Website.<br>
	  As a User you may, at any time view or update  your Personal Data within your settings tab on the Website. </p>
	<p> You may also close your account within that  same settings tab and / or request that we delete all Personal Data that we  have collected about you. We will promptly fulfill your request and provide you  confirmation when the information has been deleted.</p>
	<p>	  <strong>Listings</strong></p>
	<p>	  “Listings” or “a Listing”  is any place, product, service, event or piece of online content added to the  Nudge (by us or by a User) with the main purpose of allowing it to be reviewed  and recommended by any and all Users of the Website. Each Listing on the Website  is given its own page (a “Listing Page”), where it is described,  categorised, and where any reviews for it are added by the Users.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Nudges</strong></p>
	<p>
	  We define  “a Nudge” as an action on the Website, by a User, that demonstrates his or her  support or disapproval of any Entity listed on the Website, together with any  review and / or photographs, submitted in relation to that same Listing by the  User.</p>
	<p> While the  Nudge has been created to facilitate the sharing of recommendations and reviews  between friends, we also – in order to provide compelling content for our Users  – show the Nudges of all Users for each Entity on the relevant Listing  Page, irrespective of each User’s settings. However, unless a User has chosen –  in their account settings – to have a public profile, then only other Users  within their private network will know that any given review has been submitted  by them: to all other Users of the site their review will be annonymous.</p>
	<p> A Nudge  that is anonymous still conveys some Personal Data to those who view it: your  gender, age and location. In addition if a User who views one of your Nudges is  not in your private network, but is connected to a User who is, then you are  considered to be in their “extended network” and – as such – this fact will be  highlighted to them when they view your Nudge.&nbsp;  We include this information alongside any anonymous Nudges because we  don’t feel that they compromise the privacy of the User who has submitted them,  but they are of huge benefit to other Users of the Website who are searching  for great content and positive feedback, provided by people like them (if they  can’t find Nudges by people they know) on particular Listings on the  Website. </p>
	<p> By adding a Nudge to  the Website you accept that the owner/manager of the Entity that you have  reviewed may elect to comment on your Nudge. In doing so you may receive a  message in your account notifying you of this fact and giving you an  opportunity to enter a dialogue with that Owner – it is your choice whether to  reply or not. If you do not, that Owner will have no ability to contact you  directly or to continue the dialogue – they will also never have any access to  your contact details and, unless you have a public profile, will not even know  your name – only your age, location and gender.</p>
	<p> We must  caution all Users against including any personal information within their  Nudges which could lead to that information being collected and used by third  parties to contact them, which naturally we have no control over.</p>
	<p>        <strong>Transferring Nudges and Personal Data</strong></p>
	<p>
	  We may  sell and distribute your Nudges together with your Personal Data (excluding  your name and email address) to third parties who may display or publish such  information. We may disclose information about you and your use of the Nudge if  we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that such disclosure is  necessary to avoid liability on our part. Should the Nudge be acquired by  another party, your Personal Data may be transferred to the acquiror. You will  be notified if your Personal Data is so transferred and becomes subject to a  different privacy policy.</p>
	<p>        <strong>Cookies</strong></p>
	<p>	  Cookies  are small data files that reside on the hard drive of a user’s computer. We use  cookies to allow Users of the Nudge to enter the Website without typing in, for  example, their email address or password. If you do not want information  collected through the use of cookies, you can use the feature in your browser  to deny them. </p>
	<p> Cookies enable us to  understand and use your preferences to improve your experience on the Nudge, as  well as allowing us to track user trends and patterns.</p>
	<p> When users provide  us with registration information (name, email address etc), this data can be  matched with cookie data, if cookies have been set to be received. This means  that we can match specific users with specific usage of the Nudge. Only we  might use this information to improve our service.</p>
	<p> Some advertisers may  use the cookie technology when they advertise on the Nudge, which will also  send these advertisers (such as Google through their Google AdSense program)  some information including your IP address, your ISP, and the browser used when  you visit our site. For example Google uses the DART cookie (which uses “non  personally identifiable information” to enable it to send tailored adverts to  its users, based on their interests ("interest based targeting"). You  can opt out of this by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank">DART Ad-Serving and Search Cookie  Opt-Out</a>.</p>
	<p> Most browsers accept  cookies automatically, though you can set your browser to refuse them. Please  note though, that if you do this then the Nudge (and many other websites) may  not work as well as they will do with them enabled.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>        <strong>Third Party Websites</strong></p>
	<p>	  The Nudge  may contain links to third party websites - we are not responsible for their  privacy practices.</p>
	<p>        <strong>Security</strong></p>
	<p>	  Your  account is password-protected. Please protect your password and don’t share it  with anyone else.</p>
	<p> We use  all reasonable measures to protect your Personal Data that is stored within our  database. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please  contact us on info@theNudge.com. </p>
	<p> Although  we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of  information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that  we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this  Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>        <em>You acknowledge that the  Company cannot be, and therefore is not, responsible for any intercepted  information sent via the Internet, and you release us from any and all claims  and liability arising out of or related to any unauthorized use of intercepted  information.</em></p>
	<p>
        <strong>Modifications to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
	<p>	  By becoming a User, you agree to the terms of  this Privacy Policy as it may be amended from time to time. We may send you a  copy of any updates, though recommend that you check back intermittently to  view the policy here.</p>
	<p>        <strong>Questions</strong></p>
