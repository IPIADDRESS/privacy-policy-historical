        <h2>2.	WHEN AND WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED, AND WHY</h2>
        
		<p>a. The Nudge will ask you for information, including some personal information, if you use one of several services:</p>

            <li>i. Becoming a registered user. In order to register, you need to share some personal information, such as your name and e-mail address.

            <li>ii. Competitions &amp; Promotions. To enter a competition or promotion, you will first need to become a registered user (if you aren't one already). We may also ask you for some demographic information, such as your age. If you choose not to answer, you may not be able to participate in the competition, promotion or survey.</li>
            
            <li>iii. Information you provide by filling in forms on the Site. This includes the information you provide at the time of registering to use one of our Sites, subscribing to our services, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion and when you report a problem on the Site. If you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
             
            <li>iv. Public Information. Please note that if you choose to share information about yourself in an open format, such as through a Third Party Site like Facebook or Twitter or in the user-generated content elements of our own Sites, we consider that information to be public information – and not personal information.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>b. We may also collect and process the following data about you:</p>
        
        <ul>
        
 			<li>i. Details of transactions you carry out through our Site and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>
 
			<li>ii. Details of your visits to the Site (including but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data), whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources you access.</li>
            
	 		<li>iii. Some Content Management Systems will track user's progress through other sites and web pages visited outside of the Site.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>c. We also collect user's internet protocol addresses, which is automatically logged by our web server and are used by us and our partners to analyse activity on the Site at an aggregate level (number of visits and geographic optimisation etc). They are not cross-referenced with any other information such that an individual person could be identified.</p>
        
        <p>d. The Nudge uses cookies. A 'cookie' is a piece of information that our websites send to your browser, which then stores this information on your system. If a cookie is used, our website will be able to remember 'information' about you and your preferences either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie (see below).</p>

		<p>e. We use information from cookies for purposes which may include:</p>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li>i. identifying returning users, registrants and subscribers and to allow subscribers to be presented with a personalised version of the Site;</li>
         
            <li>ii. enabling you to move more easily around our Site;</li>
             
            <li>iii. Tracking your use of our Sites to better develop our Sites in accordance with your requirements; and</li>
             
            <li>iv. building up a demographic profile.</li>
	
        </ul>
        
        <p>f. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to 'invade' your hard drive and return to the sender with personal or other information from your computer.</p>
        
        <p>g. The Nudge sometimes makes use of ad-serving cookies. These assure that when you visit a Site, you do not see the same ad over and over again. They are also used to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page. Cookies, set or read with clear GIFs, are also used by advertisers for ad reporting functions such as to learn which of their ads are bringing users to their website to purchase or register.</p>
        
        <p>h. We sometimes use a third party to deal with advertisements on the Site. Our advertising partners will serve ads that it believes are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to this and other websites (this information is anonymous in that it does not include your name, street address, email address or telephone number). In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer.</p>
        
        <p>i. If you are worried in particular about ad-serving cookies, these have to be turned off by going to the third party's website. The link below is to our ad-server's website, and gives details of their usage of cookies. They should be contacted in the event you require details of how to disable these ad-serving cookies www.google.com/privacy/ads.</p>
        
        <p>j. You can utilise our Sites without cookies since these can be deleted from your hard drive at any time. However, if you use our Sites without cookies, you will lose your stored username and password (and these will have to be reset). You can also set your internet browser so that it will not allow cookies to be stored on your computer. This may reduce functionality of the site, prevent access to subscriber-only areas of the Site and mean that certain features or content will not be available to you.</p>
        
        <p>k. If you require further information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your computer we recommend the following website: http://www.allaboutcookies.org under the "manage cookies" section.</p>
        
        <h2>3. THE NUDGE USE OF WEB BEACONS</h2>
        
        <p>a. We have included web beacons on some of our web pages. The Nudge uses web beacons to transfer data (such as site usage history). The Nudge may provide this data to companies that assist The Nudge in data research and analysis; these companies are prohibited from using this data for any other purpose. The analysis and research helps The Nudge to determine customer preferences and improve our offerings. The Nudge may also rely upon third parties to assist with the use and implementation of the web beacons.</p>
        
        <p>b. Definition of web beacon: A web beacon, sometimes called a pixel, is a graphic image or small string of code, that is included on web pages or in an email to enable the transfer of data. Web beacons can be used by companies for several purposes such as reporting web site traffic, customer preferences, advertising effectiveness, and general auditing.</p>
        
        <h2>4. USES WE MAKE OF YOUR DATA</h2>
        
        <p>a. The Nudge may share your personal information with companies that perform services for us, such as sending e-mails, analysing and researching customer data, providing marketing assistance, processing, investigating fraudulent activity, serving ads, conducting customer surveys, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not disclose your personally identifiable information for other purposes.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <p>d. We may disclose your personal information to third parties, as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
        
        	<li>We may employ external companies to act on our behalf as processors. Data processors will not disclose personal details to any other organisations or use data other than for purposes required by us. This use is stipulated under contract with us.</li>

            <li>To administer services provided to you by us now or in the future.</li>
            
            <li>If Framework (London) Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
             
            <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of The Nudge our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p>e. We may also collect your personal information for marketing purposes. If you do not want us to use your data for marketing purposes or to pass you details to third parties for such purpose, please tick or un-tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data (for example, a registration or order form). If there is no tick box, then we will not in any event share your data. If you do allow us to use your data, you agree to allow The Nudge or one of our selected partners to contact you about promotional offers, products and/or services by email or SMS. When you give us information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, and as such, that you consent to the processing of their personal data, including personal data, to the transfer of their information abroad and to the receipt on their behalf, of any relevant data protection notices.</p>

		<h2>5. WHERE WE STORE YOUR DATA</h2>
        
        <p>a. By using this website you consent to:</p>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li>our processing of your personal data for the above purposes; and</li>
            
            <li>our transferring of your information to countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK if necessary for the above purposes. If we do make such a transfer we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is protected.</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. SOCIAL MEDIA/SOCIAL COMMERCE AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES</h2>
        
        <p>a. We work with trusted third parties, including social network sites like Facebook, and with application developers who specialise in social media so we can connect to your social networks. Other social networks we use include Twitter, MySpace and You Tube. All of these companies operate Third Party Sites. We provide access to our Sites by third parties and business partners so we can generate interest in our products and services among members of your social networks and to allow you to share product and service interests with friends in your network.</p>

        <p>b. The use of any features made available to you on the Site by a third party may result in information being collected or shared about you by us or by the third party. Information collected or shared through any such third party features is considered "public information" by us because the Third Party Sites made it publicly available. If you do not want us to be able to access information about you from Third Party Sites, you must instruct Third Party Sites not to share the information. We cannot control how your data is collected, stored, used or shared by Third Party Sites or to whom it is disclosed. Please be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on your social networking sites to make sure you understand the information they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt out of sharing such information. Framework (London) Ltd is not responsible for how these third parties may use information collected from or about you. However, we do identify any areas on the Site where third parties share information about you.</p>
  
  		<ul>
        
			<li>Facebook's "Like" feature is a good example. (Other third parties have or may have similar ways for you to express positive opinions about products and services – now or in the future.) We have agreed to allow Facebook's "Like" feature to run alongside our editorial features so you can "like" them, and to see how many other Facebook users "like" such features on our Sites. You should know that Facebook may collect or register the fact that you "like" a product and may post that information to your "News Feed" on Facebook and to your Facebook profile's "Wall" and "Info" pages. So, the fact that you "like" one or more features may be made known to members of your Facebook network. This would be true for your friends too. If they "like" one of our features, you will see it on his or her News Feed, Wall or Info pages.</li>
 
			<li>Finally, by "liking" features on our Sites, you consent to the display of that information by us. If you do not wish this to happen, you should not click that you "like" a feature and you should review your privacy settings on Facebook (or similar Third Party Site). Note that we are not obligated to display someone's name, profile photo or other "public" Facebook profile information on our website even if that Facebook user "likes" a product featured one of our Sites. We reserve the right to remove the information of any person which we deem to be inconsistent with our ideals or otherwise inappropriate for public association with our company. We may remove from the Site, in our sole discretion, any product or service offering or any photo or product description relating thereto.</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. ACCESS TO INFORMATION</h2>
        
        <p>a. The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
