    <h3><a id="privacypolicy"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>The RSA's Privacy Policy sets out the ways The RSA processes personal data. This Privacy Policy only relates to personal data collected by The RSA via The RSA website, membership forms, fundraising responses, emails and telephone calls.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal data provided to The RSA by any other means or via any other website. Users should be aware that if they access other websites, using the links provided, these are outside our control. If they provide personal data to other companies, the privacy polices of those companies determine the uses to which that information is put and The RSA's Privacy Policy will no longer apply.</p>
<h3>2. The Data Protection Act 1998</h3>
<p>The RSA makes every effort to comply with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<h3>3. Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Personal information provided to The RSA via <a href="/">The RSA website</a>, membership forms, fundraising responses, emails and telephone calls will be used for the purposes outlined at the time of collection or registration in accordance with the preferences you express.</p>
<p>Personal data collected and processed by The RSA may be used, for the following purposes:</p>
<p>a. Administration of membership(s).<br>b. Fulfilment of orders for goods and services requested.<br>c. Administration of donations and legacies.<br>d. In-house research and statistical analysis.<br>e. Communication about its conservation, membership, fundraising and other activities.<br>f. Communication about special offers from carefully selected organisations that make a financial contribution to The RSA’s funds.</p>
<p>Processing personal data for the above purposes may entail sharing the information with employees, contractors, agents and professional advisors of The RSA and other carefully selected organisations. Written agreements exist between The RSA and such parties that there must be no further disclosure of such personal data.</p>
<h3>4. Consent</h3>
<p>By providing personal data to The RSA you consent to the processing of such data by The RSA as described in this Privacy Policy. You can alter your preferences as described below.</p>
<h3>5. Use of Data For Direct Marketing by post and telephone</h3>
<p>At each point of data collection or registration you are given options to opt-out from being sent future direct marketing material from The RSA or other carefully selected organisations by post or telephone. Where you do not opt-out of such communications, The RSA may send you information on its research, membership, fundraising and other activities and those of other carefully selected organisations.</p>
<p>If at any time you want to alter your preferences or request that The RSA stop communicating with you in this way then you should write to the address shown in section 8.</p>
<h3>6. Use of Data for email</h3>
<p>At each point of data collection or registration you are given the option to opt-in to receiving email marketing from The RSA. Where you do opt-in to such communications, The RSA may provide information on its conservation, membership, fundraising and other activities and those of carefully selected organisations.</p>
<p>If at any time you want to alter your preferences or request that The RSA stop communicating with you in this way then you should write to the address shown in section 8.</p>
<h3>7. Accessing your personal data held by the RSA</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask The RSA, in writing, for a copy of all the personal data held about you (this is known as a 'subject access request') upon payment of a fee of £10. If you would like to access your personal data held by The RSA, please apply in writing to:</p>
<p>Governance Manager<br>The RSA<br>8 John Adam Street<br>London<br>WC2N 6EZ</p>
<h3>8. Verifying, updating and amending your personal information</h3>
<p>If, at any time, you want to verify, update or amend your personal data or preferences please write to:<br>The RSA<br>8 John Adam Street<br>London<br>WC2N 6EZ</p>
<p>Verification, updating or amendment of personal data will take place within 28 days of receipt of your request.</p>
<p>If subsequently you make a data protection instruction to The RSA which contradicts a previous instruction (or instructions), then the RSA will follow your most recent instruction.</p>
<h3>9. Cookies</h3>
<p>Please see our see our page regarding the RSA's use of <a href="#cookiepolicy">cookies</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Links to Third Party Websites</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the personal data collected by The RSA and does not apply to third party websites.</p>
<p>The RSA is not responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites. The RSA advises users to read the privacy policies of other websites before registering any personal data.</p>
<h3>11. Security</h3>
<p>The RSA holds your personal data in accordance with the security provisions of the UK Data Protection legislation. We use industry standard Secure Server Software (SSL) for your transactions with us. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.<br><br>If you have any questions about security please contact The RSA on: 020 7451 6922</p>
<p><a href="#securitypolicy">More information on internet security</a></p>

<p>The RSA uses Eventbrite to collect information on your attendance at events visits. This data includes the events you have visited, the date that you went and your membership number. The RSA will undertake customer analysis on this data to allow us to understand visiting trends.</p>
<p>We will also use this information to enable us to provide better marketing communications that will be tailored to your habits. However, we will always respect your decision on receiving marketing information and will never send you any marketing where you have indicated previously that you do not want to be contacted.</p>
<h3>13. Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>If The RSA decides to change its Privacy Policy, it will post such changes on its website under the section entitled <a href="#privacypolicy">'Privacy Policy'</a>.<br><br></p>
<h2><a id="cookiepolicy"></a>Cookie Policy - FAQ</h2>
<h3><b>What are cookies?</b></h3>
<p>Cookies are small, often encrypted, text files, which are stored on your computer when you visit some websites. They are used to remember useful information which allows certain functionality within the website to work, for example remembering where you have reached within an order process, or if you've logged in to a site. Cookies can't harm your computer.</p>
<p>For more information about cookies, please see the websites listed in the&nbsp;<a href="#relatedlinks">related links</a>.</p>
<h3><b>How long do cookies last?</b></h3>
<p>Cookies last for different lengths of time depending on what they are used for.</p>
<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies and are only stored until you leave the website or when you close your web browser.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies last for a fixed period of time, defined within the cookie, and allow the website to recognise the device again when the user returns to that website on that device.</p>
<p>Information about the duration of cookies used on www.thersa.org will be published in the near future.</p>
<p>Types of cookies and how www.thersa.org uses them:</p>
<p>Cookies can be categorised by who sets the cookie and also by how the cookie will be used.</p>
<h3><b>Who sets the cookie?</b></h3>
<p>First party cookies – these are set by the website that you are visiting and can only be read by that website.</p>
<p>Third party cookies – these are set by an organisation other than owner of the website. This might be for the purposes of website measurement, being able to watch a video on the site or for the purposes of advertising.</p>
<p>Both first and third-party cookies are set on www.thersa.org. We will be publishing a list of these in the near future.</p>
<h3><b>How cookies are used?</b></h3>
<p>On www.thersa.org we use cookies that perform a different variety of functions. The categorisation and definitions are based on the guide published by the International Chamber of Commerce:</p>

These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services on the site such as watching a video. These cookies do not track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
