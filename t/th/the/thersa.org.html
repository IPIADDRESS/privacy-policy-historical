            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        </div>

    <div class="content-block-edit-resize"><div class="wrapper-75 with-25"><div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>The RSA promises to take great care with your personal data, and we commit to protecting any personal information we obtain about you, whether you are visiting our website as a supporter, Fellow or funder.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how and why we obtain, use and protect personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Who we are</h3>
<p><em>We are made up of one core Royal Charter Company and two trading subsidiaries and this privacy policy applies to them all.</em></p>
<p>The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (‘RSA’) is a Royal Charter Company and registered charity in England and Wales (charity number 212424) and in Scotland (charity number SC037784). It has two wholly-owned trading subsidiaries (Adelphi Enterprises Limited, company number 002784581 and Shipley Enterprises Limited, company number 09823249).</p>
<p>Additionally, for Fellows and other supporters living in the US and Canada we share our data with our affiliate RSA in the USA. For Fellows and other supporters and contacts living in Australia and New Zealand, we share our data with our affiliate RSA ANZ.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all the above entities.</p>
<p>The RSA's and its subsidiaries registered address is 8 John Adam Street, London, WC2N 6EZ.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy relates to information which is obtained by the RSA and for which the RSA is the Data Controller.</p>
<h3>2. Our Purpose</h3>
<p><em>Our purpose is to enrich society through ideas and action.</em></p>
<p>The RSA’s mission is to enrich society through ideas and action. Central to this mission is our commitment to be transparent about the data we collect about you and how it is used and shared.</p>
<p>The RSA is a charity that believes that all human beings have creative capacities that, when understood and supported, can be mobilised to deliver a 21st century enlightenment. The RSA seeks to share powerful ideas, carry out cutting-edge research and build networks and opportunities for people to collaborate, helping to create fulfilling lives and a flourishing society. The RSA includes its 29,000 Fellows who are members of the RSA under its governance structure. The RSA seeks to involve its Fellows in its work as partners and advocates on its behalf.</p>
<h3>3.&nbsp;<b>Why we hold and process personal data.</b></h3>
<p><em>We keep data for the furtherance of our charitable obligations.</em></p>
<p>We hold and process personal data for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To keep a record of our Fellows their subscriptions, other donations and actions taken by our wider supporters including our communications with them</li>
<li>To make offers of Fellowship and invite people to become involved in our work and projects</li>
<li>To claim gift aid on donations</li>
<li>To send our Fellows and supporters marketing information about our projects, fundraising activities and appeals where we have their consent or are otherwise allowed to</li>
<li>To fulfil contractual obligations entered into with supporters and funders</li>
<li>To meet wider legal obligations such as those of our grant funders</li>
<li>To support Fellows and other volunteers to form networks, run events and projects, and collaborate</li>
<li>To record our campaigning actions and those of our supporters</li>
<li>To meet our charitable reporting duties</li>
<li>To track those who use our House either as Customers, members of the public or Fellows.</li>
<li>To ensure we do not send unwanted information to supporters or members of the public who have informed us they do not wish to be contacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our website and charitable outputs are available to all in line with our charitable obligations. Our Fellows also share their professional identities, engage with network, exchange knowledge and find opportunities through our MyRSA section of our website.</p>
<h3>4. Your Consent and Notices of Changes</h3>
<p><em>If you engage with us including through use of our website, you consent to this Privacy Policy, including our Cookies Policy.</em></p>
<p>If you engage with the RSA including through our website, you consent to the collection, use and sharing of your personal data under this Privacy Policy (which includes our Cookie Policy and any other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy). We provide you with choices that allow you to opt-out or control how we use and share your data.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to the RSA. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the RSA website to submit personal information to the RSA. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the website.</p>

<p><b>Content provided by Third Parties published on our website</b></p>

<p><b>Direct Marketing </b></p>
<p>We currently do not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p><b>Profiling</b></p>
<p>Profiling is a common technique used in direct marketing and involves analysing data to improve the targeting of communications. The RSA uses profiling techniques to help ensure our communications are relevant.&nbsp; Profiling allows us to target our resources effectively, which donors consistently tell us is a key priority for them. It enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, than we otherwise would. The data may have been provided to the RSA by our supporters when responding to our marketing campaigns, or when using our website, or social media sites such as Facebook. It may also have been provided by external organisations as described below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When building a profile we may analyse geographic, demographic and other information relating to you, as well as your previous responses to our marketing campaigns. We do this in order to determine whether we believe a particular marketing campaign might be of interest. Some of the data is provided by external organisations and may be provided at an aggregate level (e.g. by postcode). Where it relates to you as an individual we check that you have provided your express consent to the relevant third party for this use of your data. This helps to maximise the effectiveness of our campaigns and to minimise the wastage that would result from sending marketing information where it is not of interest.</p>
