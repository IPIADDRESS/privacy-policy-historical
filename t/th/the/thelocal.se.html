When you subscribe to The Local it is only necessary for you to leave your email address. However, we also ask you for a few other details such as name, age, nationality, sex, location and occupation.

<h2>Why do we collect this information?</h2>

Obviously, if you're going to receive The Local every week by email, we need your email address. But there are two reasons why we ask for more information from you:

<p>1. To help us improve our service. We want to make sure that the news stories we cover are what our audience wants to read about. In other words, if 90% of our readers were octogenarian Brazilian rocket scientists living in Kiruna (they're not), we would be able to focus our articles accordingly.</p>

<p>2. To use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on emails or the site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many female users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser. Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user's explicit permission.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

We will not share information about you (including your email address) with others without your prior consent.

<p>You will receive unsolicited mail from The Local and/or from appropriate third parties only if you have agreed to this. We will, however, mail you occasionally with updates about the service and information about your registration.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we will only share anonymous aggregate statistics about our readers with our advertisers.</p>

<p>Should we elect to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here. Where the changes are significant, we may also choose to email all our registered users with the new policy details.</p> 

<p>The Local will use all reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the information. However we are not responsible for any breach of security or any actions of any third parties who receive the information.</p> 

<p>Please note that we reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both ourselves and our users.</p>
