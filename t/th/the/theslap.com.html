  <p class="justify">We may request or
  collect certain information when you visit the Nickelodeon Sites. However, visitors are
  required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in
  the particular activity.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_A"><strong> A.&nbsp;
  Registration Information</strong></a>:&nbsp; The information required to register varies by
  Site, but may include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e) zip
  code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone number; (h) email address; and
  (i) other profile information such as avatar preferences, communications preferences,
  and interests. If the Site either is directed to children under 13 or has actual
  knowledge that a user is under 13 years old, the child may be asked to provide his or her
  parent's or guardian's email address. For certain countries, visitors or their parents/guardians
  will receive an activation email and must follow the procedures or otherwise agree to
  the terms within the activation email within a certain time period to activate the
  account; accounts not activated within that time period will be deleted.</p>
  <p class="justify">Registration information
  is used to enable visitors to take advantage of site offerings; respond to
  visitor’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; serve
  appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Nickelodeon
  Sites; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the
  “Viacom family of companies” (which comprises Viacom International Inc. and
  its subsidiaries and affiliates), as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.
</p>

<p class="justify">Certain non-child-directed Sites may offer visitors opportunities to apply for certain programs or other employment, training or internship opportunities. In order to submit an application for any one of these opportunities, the applicant may be required to supply other pertinent personal information including, without limitation, full name, postal address, telephone number(s) and email address.  Additional personal information and other information may be requested during the application process (but may not be required).  Such submissions are also subject to the policies regarding such respective programs.

  Registrations and Social Media Plugins</strong></a>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or
  require users who are at least 13 years old to register or log into their account via a social networking platform such
  as Login with Facebook or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the
  Facebook “Like” or Google “+1” buttons. When you use these
  social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services
  and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may
  be shared with us.</p>
  <p class="justify">When you use social

  web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile
  devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site,

  companies (<em>e.g.</em>, links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or
  forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies
  (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard
  server log information ("Computer Information").</p>
  <p class="justify">We may use cookies, web
  beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking
  Technologies”) on the Nickelodeon Sites. "Cookies" (which may be html files,
  Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and
  activity.&nbsp;“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs)
  are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views,
  promotion views or advertising responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tokens” are unique 
  persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobeâs Pass 
  service, to a userâs device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication 
  for a userâs cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.

  device you use to access the site (“Identifier”). An Identifier may be
  automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. When a

<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>  

<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

  notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the
  newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or

  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information

  messaging services or customized video content. These partners operate websites and services that are separate and
  independent from the Nickelodeon Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy
