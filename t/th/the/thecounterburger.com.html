<p><strong>The The Counter Franchise System</strong></p>
<p>The The Counter franchise system is a restaurant network made up of company-operated, franchised, and licensed The Counter restaurant businesses. The Counter franchisees (“Franchised Operators” or “Operators”) own and operate their own individual franchised businesses. The Counter licensees (“Licensees”) are granted a license to use The Counter’s trade name and marks in the sale of The Counter products at The Counter licensed locations. Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee, or to any The Counter operations outside of the United States. Please see the Franchised Operator and Licensee Online Services section below for more information regarding a Franchised Operator’s or Licensee’s applicable policies.</p>
<p><strong>Information Covered by This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information, including Personal Information, collected about you by The Counter and its third-party service providers. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that personally identifies you.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected</strong></p>
<p>The Counter and its third-party service providers collect information about you from a variety of sources, including information you provide directly to us, and information we collect about you when you interact with us. For example, we and our third-party service providers collect information both directly and indirectly from you when you:</p>
<ul>

<li>contact or communicate with us;</li>
<li>create an account with us;</li>
<li>request information from us;</li>
<li>register for any event or program, and/or participate in any event, program, contest, surveys, or other promotion that we may offer directly or with another third party from time to time (collectively, “Promotions”);</li>
<li>begin or complete the application process for a franchise opportunity, or for employment by Kahala Management, L.L.C.;</li>

<p>We do not require you to provide any information related to your racial origin, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>When you use the fingerprint login features on your Apple or Android devices, we do not receive your fingerprint data. Your mobile phone’s authentication mechanism helps us verify that it is you.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Data</strong></p>
<p>We and our third-party service providers may also collect information, including Personal Information, relating to your purchases from The Counter locations and our Franchised Operators and Licensees, such as the authorization code of the transaction, payment method, the date and time of the transaction, items purchased, and the purchase price (“Transaction Data”).</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
<p>We and our third-party service providers use tracking technologies such as Traffic Data, Cookies, Web Beacons, and others to automatically collect certain information from you when you use The Counter U.S. Online Services. The following are examples of information we may collect with these technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>your IP address, browser type, and operating system;</li>
<li>your device attributes including but not limited to device ID;</li>
<li>pages you view within The Counter U.S. Online Services (including videos viewed);</li>
<li>if you buy goods from us, what you buy, where you buy, how frequently you buy and rewards you earn;</li>
<li>search information (e.g. terms or keywords you search for when using the The Counter U.S. Online Services);</li>
<li>websites you visited before coming to The Counter U.S. Online Services;</li>
<li>emails from us that you open and/or forward; and/or</li>
<li>offers or links from us to which you connect.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to personalize your online experience and for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The Counter U.S. Online Services tracks and collects your IP address, domain server, type of computer, and type of web browser (collectively, “Traffic Data”) for our marketing purposes and to manage and improve The Counter U.S. Online Services.</p>
<p>We also use cookies, which are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and allow websites to remember information about users (“Cookies”). We use Cookies to monitor how The Counter U.S. Online Services are used, for marketing purposes, and to help personalize and improve The Counter U.S. Online Services. Most browsers automatically accept Cookies. You have the choice to set your browser to accept or reject Cookies. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your Cookie preferences. You can also learn more about Cookies at the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Microsoft Internet Explorer: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.mspx;</li>
<li>For Mozilla Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/protect-your-privacy/cookies;</li>
<li>For Safari: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1677; and/or</li>
<li>http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to decline Cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our The Counter U.S. Online Services or programs, features, and services made available through any of The Counter U.S. Online Services.</p>
<p>Certain pages on The Counter U.S. Online Services and Social Media Pages may contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs), which are small bits of code embedded in pages or images on The Counter U.S. Online Services and Social Media Pages (“Web Beacons”). We may also include Web Beacons in e-mails we send to you to learn if messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. You can disable the ability of Web Beacons to capture such information. Please refer to the “Help” menu of your browser to learn more about Web Beacons and your ability to disable them.</p>
<p>We and our third-party service providers may also utilize other tracking technologies. For example, if permitted by applicable law, we may collect “referrers” and various environmental variables. A “referrer” is information the web browser passes along to our or our third-party service provider web servers, which refers to the URL from which you accessed The Counter U.S. Online Services. Environmental variables may include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed The Counter U.S. Online Services or Social Media Pages, the type of web browsers and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the website you left to visit The Counter U.S. Online Services or Social Media Pages, the names of the web pages you visit, and the Internet address of the website you visit next. These environmental variables are collected by many websites. We use these technologies for marketing purposes and to optimize user’s experience with The Counter U.S. Online Services.</p>
<p>We treat information automatically collected as non-personally identifying information. Such information may be combined with your Personal Information so that we can improve and customize The Counter U.S. Online Services and our communications and Promotions. To the extent that information automatically collected is combined with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our The Counter U.S. Online Services. We do not control the tracking technologies used by third party providers as detailed herein.</p>
<p>We may target and track the videos you view on The Counter U.S. Online Services. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the The Counter U.S. Online Services or third party social media for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law or until you withdraw consent.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), on certain The Counter U.S. Online Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often you visit The Counter U.S. Online Services, what pages you visit within The Counter U.S. Online Services, and what other sites you visited prior to coming to the applicable The Counter U.S. Online Service. We use the information provided by Google Analytics to improve The Counter U.S. Online Services. For more information regarding how Google collects, uses and shares your information please visit http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Google provides users more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics by developing an Opt-out Browser Add-on which can be located at: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. By installing this Add-on, no information is being sent to Google Analytics.</p>
<p><strong>California’s Do Not Track Notice</strong></p>
<p>At this time, there is no worldwide uniform or consistent industry standard or definition for responding to, processing, or communicating Do Not Track signals. Thus, The Counter U.S. Online Services are unable to respond to Do Not Track Signals. We do not, however, currently track your Personal Information over time and across third-party websites.</p>
<p>The Counter does not allow third parties to collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use The Counter U.S. Online Services for such third party use. We do use third party web analytics services on The Counter U.S. Online Services, such as Google Analytics, to help us obtain and analyze information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include Personal Information other than your IP address.</p>

<p>If you utilize any of the location-based services in our mobile applications, such as the fine a location function, we and our third-party service providers may collect, use, and share location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device. We use such information to provide and improve location-based products and services. You may opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.</p>

We may also collect Personal Information about you from third parties to supplement, update, or verify your information, and/or to process your application for consideration as a Franchised Operator. Applicable law may require that you authorize a third party to share your Personal Information with us before we can acquire it. Failure to provide any requested information may negatively impact consideration of your application to become a Franchised Operator.

<p>The Counter U.S. Online Services and our communications (including e-mails) may contain links to other third-party websites, including, without limitation, the websites of Franchised Operators and Licensees, and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare (such third-party websites and social media platforms are collectively referred to herein as “Linked Sites”).

<p><strong>Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information originally was collected.
