<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Welcome to TheInformation.com, the website and online service of Lessin
Media Company (“Lessin Media,” “we,” or “us”). &nbsp;Our Privacy Policy
explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that
applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of
your information.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the
meaning given them in our Terms of Service
(http://www.theinformation.com/terms-of-service).</p>

<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

<p>Information you provide us directly: We ask for certain information such
as your username, first and last name, birthdate, phone number and
e-mail address when you register for a Lessin Media account, or if you
correspond with us. &nbsp;We may also retain any messages you send through
the Service. &nbsp;We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide
to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>

<p>Analytics information: &nbsp;We may directly collect analytics data, or use
third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends
for the Service. &nbsp;These tools collect information sent by your browser
or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information
that assists us in improving the Service. &nbsp;We collect and use this
analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably
be manipulated to identify any particular individual user. &nbsp;We do not
collect information from you for behavioral advertising purposes. We may
collect a persistent identifier from your browser or mobile device to
assist us with providing and improving the Service.&nbsp; Because we collect
browsing and persistent identifier data only for analytic and internal
purposes, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your
browser, if applicable, will not have any effect on our collection of
analytics information or the collection of a persistent identifier.</p>

<p>Cookies information: &nbsp;When you visit the Service, we may send one or
more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and
lets Lessin Media help you log in faster and enhance your navigation
through the site. &nbsp;A cookie may also convey information to us about how
you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and
other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business
partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent
cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
&nbsp;Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
the site. &nbsp;Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
browser’s directions. &nbsp;A session cookie is temporary and disappears
after you close your browser. &nbsp;You can reset your web browser to refuse
all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. &nbsp;However, some
features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to
accept cookies is disabled.</p>

<p>Log file information: &nbsp;Log file information is automatically reported by
your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. &nbsp;When
you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
information. &nbsp;These server logs may include anonymous information such
as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type,
referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact
with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed,
and other such information.</p>

<p>Clear gifs/web beacons information: &nbsp;When you use the Service, we may
employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to
anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. &nbsp;In addition,
we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to
track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
&nbsp;The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of
the Service.</p>

<p>Commercial and marketing communications: We use the information we
collect or receive to communicate directly with you. &nbsp;We may send you
emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. &nbsp;If you do
not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to
opt out or change your preferences. &nbsp;We also use your information to
send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase
and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of
the Service, technical and security notices). &nbsp;You may not opt out of
Service-related e-mails.</p>

<p>Use of certain service type information we collect about you: We use or
may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear
gifs information to: &nbsp;(a) remember information so that you will not have
to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site;
(b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide
and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate
metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic
patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) help you
efficiently access your information after you sign in. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside
Lessin Media and its group companies (including any parent, subsidiaries
and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below:</p>

<p>Who we may share your information with: We may share your information
with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the
Service to you. &nbsp;Those business partners will be given limited access to
your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and
we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.
&nbsp;We do not permit third parties to collect information about your online
activities over time and across different Web sites when you use our
Service.</p>

<p>Who you may choose to share your content with: Any information or
content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service becomes
available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy
settings. &nbsp;If you remove information that you posted to the Service,
copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service,
or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>

<p>What happens in the event of a change of control: We may buy or
sell/divest/transfer Lessin Media (including any shares in the Lessin
Media), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or
businesses. &nbsp;Your information such as customer names and email addresses
and other user information related to the Service may be among the items
sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. &nbsp;We may
also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course
of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies,
dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or
proceedings involving all or a portion of Lessin Media.</p>

<p>Instances where we are required to share your information: Lessin Media
will disclose your information where required to do so by law or
subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to
(a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement;
(b) to enforce our Terms of Service
(http://www.theinformation.com/terms-of-service) or to protect the
security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect
the rights, property, or personal safety of Lessin Media, our Users or
others.</p>

<p>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you: &nbsp;We may
share certain service type information, including information obtained
through tools such as cookies, log files and clear gifs (such as
anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types,
number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for
the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and Use
Information.” &nbsp;We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all
personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated,
anonymized data with third parties.</p>

<h2>3.&nbsp;HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Storage and Processing: &nbsp;Your information collected through the Service
may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in
which Lessin Media or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers
maintain facilities. Lessin Media may transfer information that we
collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated
entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country
or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
&nbsp;If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws
governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please
note that we may transfer information, including personal information,
to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data
protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of
information to the U.S. or any other country in which Lessin Media or
its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain
facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as
described in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Keeping your information safe: &nbsp;Lessin Media cares about the security of
your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to
preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through
the Service. &nbsp;To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable
steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity
before granting you access to your account. &nbsp;You are responsible for
maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information,
and for controlling access to your email communications from Lessin
Media, at all times. &nbsp;However, Lessin Media cannot ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to Lessin Media or guarantee
that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered,
or destroyed. &nbsp;Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to
the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the
Lessin Media Service, such as social networks. &nbsp;Lessin Media is not
responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third
party.</p>

<p>Compromise of information: &nbsp;In the event that any information under our
control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Lessin Media
will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where
appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been
compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws
and regulations.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>You control your account information and settings: &nbsp;You may update your
account information and email-communication preferences at any time by
logging into your account and changing your profile settings. &nbsp;You can
also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking
on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. &nbsp;We make
every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. &nbsp;As noted
above, you may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g.,
account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders,
changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security
notices). &nbsp;If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your
account information, you can contact us directly at
support@theinformation.com.</p>

<p>Opting out of collection of your information for Tracking: &nbsp;Please refer
to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for
instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other
tracking/recording tools. &nbsp;Depending on your type of device, it may not
be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile
device. Note that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents
Lessin Media or its business partners from tracking your browser’s
activities in relation to the Service. &nbsp;However, doing so may disable
many of the features available through the Service. &nbsp;If you have any
questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other
tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at
support@theinformation.com.</p>

</a><p><a name="yourchoicesaboutyourinformation">How long we keep your content: &nbsp;Following termination or deactivation of
your User account, Lessin Media may retain your profile information for
a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.

anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register
as Users. &nbsp;The Service and its content are not directed at children
under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected
personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that
information as quickly as possible. &nbsp;If you believe that we might have
