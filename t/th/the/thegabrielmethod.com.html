<h1 align="center" style="font-size:24pt;">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p></p>
<p>At The Gabriel Method, we care about your privacy. This policy describes how we will deal with your personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles and the Australian Privacy Act.</p>
<p><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about <strong>personal information</strong>, we mean information or an opinion about an individual where you can tell or reasonably work out who the information or opinion is about.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to know you</strong></p>
<p>To help us help you, it is often important we know a few things about you. However, we will only collect personal information about you that is relevant to our relationship.</p>
<p>Where reasonably possible, we will only collect personal information when you know we are. For example, we may request general information like your name, e-mail address and contact details when you ask us a question or contact us. We may also need to ask for other information, including your credit card details, shipping address and computer’s IP address when you wish to purchase a product or a service from us. If you do not provide some of this information, we may not be able to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Some sections of our website, such as our forums, allow you to store and publish personal information about you and other people. You are responsible and accept liability for ensuring that those people are happy to have their personal information published on this site and are made aware of the terms of this privacy policy. You authorise us to contact any third person to confirm that they are happy for their personal information to be posted here, but we are under no obligation to you to do so.</p>
<p>Our purpose for collecting personal information should be clear when we collect it. If you are not sure, please contact us by email, or write to us at the address below.</p>
<p>You can generally visit our website without revealing who you are or other personal information. We will not collect any personal information about you when you visit our website except where you are a registered member, or where you knowingly provide us with personal information.</p>
<p>We may keep track of which sections of our website you visit for internal purposes, including to help us improve our website and other services.</p>
<p><strong>Use and disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Subject to our legal obligations and our other rights under any agreement with you, we will do our best to only give out your personal information to those people listed below and to any other people you have asked us to provide it to.</p>
<p>We will only use your personal information as allowed by law. This means we may use it for the purpose it was collected, as apparent at the time of collection, or as otherwise set out in this policy. If we want to use your information for any other purpose, we will first seek your consent unless we are not required to by law.</p>
<p>We generally only use or disclose your personal information to:</p>
<ol>
<li>provide you with information, products or services you have requested;</li>
<li>promote your success story to visitors to our website through testimonial or other feedback pages with your consent;</li>
<li>help us to improve our website, marketing and services;</li>
<li>tell you about any new developments, offers or events we think may interest you;</li>
<li>other organisations that provide services to us, such as mailing houses, event organisers, IT contractors (such as website developers and hosts), internet service providers and professional services firms;</li>
<li>credit reference and reporting agencies and other credit providers if you place a large order or wish us to extend credit;</li>
<li>law enforcement and other government agencies where permitted by law; and</li>
<li>meet any legal requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we strive to protect and respect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you send over the Internet. When you post information on a section of our site available to others, such as in our forums, it becomes available to all other visitors to that section of our site.</p>
<p><strong>Access to personal information</strong></p>
<p>You can request access to personal information we hold about you at any time. We will give you access unless we are allowed or required by law to refuse it. We may ask you to pay our reasonable costs of providing access.</p>
<p>If you believe personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, please let us know. We will generally take reasonable steps to correct your personal information where inaccuracies are found.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may refuse to give access to your personal information or amend it. Usually we will explain why and, in the case of an amendment, make a note that you disagree with the accuracy or completeness of particular information.</p>
<p><strong>Security and integrity</strong></p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the security of information you may transmit to us. We will take reasonable steps to keep your personal information secure, accurate, complete and up to date except where at the time you supply it, it is clear that it will be published on the website. If we no longer require your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify it. We do not take responsibility for the security of information that is outside our control such as when it is sent over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this policy</strong></p>
<p>To keep up with regulatory, technical and organisational change, we may change this policy from time to time by publishing the updated policy on our website. Please be sure to visit our website regularly to keep up to date with any changes.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting us</strong></p>
<p>If you have any problems or complaints, or general questions regarding our information handling practices, please contact us by email or by writing to:</p>

<p><strong>"Since listening to your CD every night, I don't feel hungry at all"</strong></p>

<p>I have been struggling with my weight for the past ten years… I could not understand because I don't eat desserts, cakes, chocolate or sweets and I cook most of my food. After reading your book I realized that I was actually nutrient deficient. Since I have been listening to your CD every night, I don't feel hungry at all. </p>

<p><strong>"I was so impressed by my results with Jon’s Method"</strong></p>

<p>I was working at radio station 4BC when Jon came on to our breakfast show at my request as a producer for several shows. I was so impressed by my own results with Jon’s Method that I wanted to get him on air.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"My whole relationship with food has changed"</strong></p>

<p>WOW! I read [the book] over two nights, couldn't put it down. It was like the penny had dropped, after three days of listening to your meditation CD, my whole relationship with food changed... I can't explain my extra energy, my ability to handle my very stressful job is so much easier, I'm happier and more confident. </p>

<p align="right">(Brenda Black, New Zealand)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I am astounded at the changes that I have made in my life"</strong></p>

<p>I cannot remember the last time I felt so alive, fulfilled, and happy. When I read your book it was as if you knew me better than I knew myself. It is amazing that more be people have not made the connection that a healthy lifestyle consists of taking care of the mind, body, and soul, instead of just the body... </p>

<p align="right">(Kenn Paquette)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I don't crave sugar at all anymore"</strong></p>

<p>Since I've read your book and listened to you CD, I've been craving dark green leafy veggies, and I've also slowed way down on sugar. As a matter of fact I don't crave sugar! </p>

<p>My daughter is doing great too. We both have committed to following your lifestyle. I tell everyone I see about your book and CD. Thank you so much.</p>

<p><strong>"The Gabriel Method is groundbreaking and self-empowering"</strong></p>

<p>You have brought together a multitude of aspects and created a truly holistic 'treatment' that is more a new lifestyle and at a time of raised awareness where it all makes such intuitive and rational sense. </p>

<p align="right">(Julie U, Australia)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I have made positive changes in all aspects of my life"</strong></p>

<p>I am feeling so much more energetic already as I gradually introduce more live foods and nutrients into my body. Your desire to share your wealth of knowledge and amazing success with weight loss is what is so inspiring to me and I'm sure will be to millions of others around the world.</p>

<p align="right">(Laura Nally, Australia)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I'm no longer hungry, just content!"</strong></p>

<p>… for the first time in over 20 years, I am not hungry. I feel content - just very different. For some reason, I don't seem to require a lot of food. My portion sizes have gotten smaller. I don't measure them out, but I look at what's on my plate and it really is a small amount. I just don't feel that I need it. I don't crave sweets either and I'm a chocoholic - at least I was one. Now I can take it or leave it.</p> 

<p align="right">(Liz Bay)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"My energy levels and stamina have increased exponentially"</strong></p>

<p>After following your method I can now get back into some of my old "skinny" clothes, which is fabulous! PLUS I am eating a lot more and exercising less! So, Jon...a big THANK YOU. How wonderful for you to be able to help people in this way!</p>

<p align="right">(Janet Mitchell, Australia)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I now understand what my body wants"</strong></p>

<p>Your work has helped me in at least two ways: first, since my husband died 20 months ago, I added 15 pounds and have slowly lost it over a year...but it would keep coming back in 2-3 pound lots. I now know why I gained the weight and how to take it off without cycling through diets and most of all without 'working' at it.  </p>

<p align="right">(Virginia Burton)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"Your approach is enlightening"</strong></p>

<p>The whole approach is enlightening, very interesting and humorous, so it was a joy to listen to. Many thanks for a great, commendable program, Jon. I am telling everyone all about you.</p>

<p align="right">(Marianne Hale, USA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I have finally found the holistic weight-loss approach I was looking for"</strong></p>

<p>I have FINALLY found the holistic approach to weight loss that I have been searching for. Your method is the first holistic approach that has made sense to me. Thank you so much.</p>  

<p align="right">(Kathy Namaste, USA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I can say with confidence that my weight will continue to fall off me"</strong></p>

<p>The Gabriel Method is the most amazing process… our bodies work the way they work. I have been using this method for a month, cut back my walking by half and people are asking me what diet I am on! I have complete pleasure in telling them I am on no diet and letting my body get me to where I need to be.</p> 

<p align="right">(Karen, New Zealand)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"Your ideas are revolutionary"</strong></p>

<p>I've applied visualization techniques using your CD for the first time last night and I'm feeling a big difference from within today. </p>

<p align="right">(Clint, USA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>"I am finally giving my body a chance to live"</strong></p>

<p>I find I am no longer obsessing about food all day.  I have had chocolate bars and cake in the house all week and I have paid no attention to them (normally they would pray on my mind all day until they were gone, and still I would not be satisfied). </p>

<p>Gone are the days of constant dieting, taking pills and shakes and feeling guilty about food.  I now have a powerful tool (my mind) just took someone like yourself for me to realize it was always there for me and will work for me when I truly need it to.  Any doubters out there I say, give it a go! You have nothing to lose but weight which has held you back from the true sense of living. </p>

<p align="right">(Caroline)</p>
<p><strong>“Not only have I lost 8kg in a month, but I feel alive again”</strong></p>
<p>I was given The Gabriel Method book about a month ago. I had some skepticism about this new dieting fad. How wrong I was. I had given up on the idea that one day I could be thin again, however, I read the book in one weekend and as they say, I had a light bulb moment, where I finally realized why I was overweight. It has been a month now and not only have I lost 8kgs, but I am alive again, and it has been noticed by everyone around me. I am smiling and have a passion for life again.</p>
<p align="right">(Mia Howard, USA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“I am finally seeing results!”</strong></p>
<p>Bless you Jon and your soothing voice that sends me to sleep everynight! No insomnia since I started listening to the CD and after too many years of being overweight, I am finally seeing results! :)</p>
<p align="right">(Toni-Marie Burns-Cimijotta)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I lost 9 kgs in two months”</strong></p>
<p>I started to follow The Gabriel Method book and two months later I have lost 9 kgs. At this time I have not done any exercise due to having arthritis. My aim is to lose another 15kgs &amp; I believe it's going to happen..Jon Gabriel you are a God send!</p>
<p align="right">(Mohammad Carson)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“Brilliant and Insightful”</strong></p>
<p>I love The Gabriel Method book..it brings together many concepts I have studied for years and have not been able to collate in a usable way..brilliant and insightful.. Jon is light-years ahead of the world and since I started listening to the CD at night time, I have lost another 4 kg. My body and mind loves this. Of all the books I have read, this one shows a truth my body understands.</p>
<p align="right">(Susan Morkovsky)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“I’m down from a size 18 to a 10/12 in four months”</strong></p>
<p>I started listening to The Gabriel Method visualization/meditation at the end of August. Four months later, I'm down from a size 18 to a 10/12. I have lost almost 40 lbs. I didn't change much other than to add some walking 5 days a week which I haven't even done for 2 months since the snow started and I'm still losing weight.</p>
<p align="right">(Anne Jensen)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I sleep better, feel better and want to eat better”</strong></p>
<p>I have read The Gabriel Method book in the last 2 weeks, and what a change to my life! I am about 70kg overweight, but have discovered that losing weight is really a change of mindset about your life and food. I lost 2.2kg since I started reading the book and listening to the CD every night. I sleep better, feel better and want to eat better already. I was a chip(crisps)aholic and have not craved any in about 3 weeks now - that alone is a miracle! </p>
<p align="right">(Roshette Badenhorst Van Rensburg)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Reprogramming the mind makes so much sense”</strong></p>
<p>I just started reading The Gabriel Method book and it is like Jon is talking directly to me and telling me, Hey Jeff, you are not alone and this will work for you. I am thankful to Jon for writing this book. Finally there is something that I can actually do to lose weight - reprogramming the mind makes so much sense to me!</p>
<p align="right">(Jeff Devitt)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“WOW! I am amazed at the results”</strong></p>
<p>I was a little skeptical when I first came across this book but I thought, what have I got to lose, I'll read it &amp; listen to the CD anyway and see what happen.WOW! I am amazed at the results! I lost 1kg in the first week but the biggest change has been a mental one. I am no longer craving sweet things or worried about food all the time and I find that I am wanting to exercise and eat natural healthy foods.</p>
<p align="right">(Sharon Fatseas)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I no longer have food addiction”</strong></p>
<p>I am a huge fan of your work which has been inspiring and has helped me a lot. As a biology student your ideas make perfect sense to me and explained a lot about why I am the size that I am. Before your book I was obsessed with eating and I couldn't stop thinking about. After incorporating your ideas into my life I no longer have this food addiction except if I am stressed or not eating right. It is surprising how predictable my body has become! Thanks for sharing your ideas with me and the rest of the world.</p>
<p align="right">(Noha Ana)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“I believe in the power of visualization.”</strong></p>
<p>I downloaded The Gabriel Method CD and listen to it every night. It has been miraculous for me. I just can't think of any other way to describe it. I believe in the power of visualization and this has been another reminder of the powerful link between mind and body. I lost 1kg in my first week and found myself exercising every day and eating much healthier food.</p>

<p align="right">(James Ian Marshall)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“I know that I will achieve my ideal weight”</strong></p>
<p>I've been on The Gabriel Method for three weeks now and have noticed that my belt notch has decreased one notch which is about 2 cm! I don't even show the slightest interest in cakes, biscuits or other 'party' foods and only eat my three main meals (most days), and I now drink a lot more water. I used to not eat breakfast and constantly obsess over food. It was the true 'famine' syndrome. I know that I will achieve my ideal weight.</p>
<p align="right">(Kerrie Falconer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I catch myself dancing and whistling!”</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks and 6.5 pounds down, I’m feeling great, have a new attitude, am much less cranky and I am catching myself dancing and whistling! ME! As great as all of this is, the aspect of that I find the most surprising is the amount of detoxing my body has gone through. </p>
<p align="right">(Sarah Morris-Martin)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I’m starting to feel like a THIN person”</strong></p>
<p>I bought the book a week ago, read it that night and wow, it sure did put a lot of "stuff" into perspective about food, weight gain and weight retention. I immediately started to implement "whole foods" and I really don't feel like eating rubbish at all. I’m enjoying real food, which is good for me and I am already starting to feel like a thin person, because the weight is falling off.... I am feeling so much better, thank you Jon!</p>
<p align="right">(Kate Morris)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I feel better and don't crave sugar”</strong></p>
<p>A week into doing The Gabriel Method I feel better already. I don't crave sugar, am eating fruits and veggies and am feeling great! Thanks Jon!</p>
<p align="right">(Betty Blake)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>“The Gabriel Method is truly amazing”</strong></p>
<p>The Gabriel Method truly is amazing! My cravings are subsiding and I feel so much healthier. The CD is the key for me. I started it on July 31 and have lost 7lbs so far! This is miraculous for me, after exercising 7 days a week and counting every calorie I was losing about 1 lb per week. Now, my first week and NO exercise I lost 7lbs! Thank you Jon Gabriel!</p>
<p align="right">(Kristen Berntzen McKenzie)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“Finally a solution that addresses the real issues”</strong></p>
<p>I just finished The Gabriel Method book. It's been 3 days since I got it and started reading and listening to the CD. My mindset is changing. My cravings are changing. I don't want sugar (amazing for me) anymore. I'm so glad to be ending the struggle once and for all. Finally a solution that addresses the real issues instead of throwing diets at it. </p>
<p align="right">(Meredith Hilton Pond)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“I am feeling like a Queen ”</strong></p>
<p>I am in awe at how well I am sleeping- I’m feeling like a Queen and even exercising with mighty enthusiasm. Visualizing and the mind connection are saving my life. Thanks a million, Jon.</p>
<p align="right">(Rosa Oquendo)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>“I have lost 7 kgs in 2 weeks! ”</strong></p>
<p>I owe a lot to Jon Gabriel and it's only been 2 weeks since I started this way of life. I have lost 7 kgs, never feel  hungry and now really feel like eating the right foods all the time.148 kg to 141 kg in 2 weeks. This is the start of my journey, thank you Jon Gabriel.</p>

<p><strong>“ My body just turned off the stomach switch! ”</strong></p>

<p>I have just finished reading The Gabriel Method book, and listened to the meditation CD tonight for the first time. The thing that amazes me most so far is how full I feel after eating a fraction of what I'm used to! It's like my body just turned off the stomach switch! There's a full cheesecake sitting in the fridge (normally something I’d sit down and eat in about ten minutes) and it's just plain uninteresting. Amazing after only a few days of knowing about this book! </p>
<p align="right">(Amanda Hager)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“The Gabriel Method shows why diets don't work ”</strong></p>
<p>Great work Jon. You show why diets don't work an explain how to lose weight and keep it off. This message needs to be heard! Too many people are getting ripped off by fad diets and useless infomercial products which promise instant weight loss but promote long-term weight gain. The only way to fix any problem is to fix the cause. You show how to do that! Keep up the great work</p>
<p align="right">(Joe Amoia)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“For the first time ever I feel like there is hope”</strong></p>
<p>I bought The Gabriel Method book this week, downloaded the CD and have used it every night since. Already I notice I am much more positive, not just about weight loss, but I’m noticing that things that would normally stress or tire me, simply don't!  Also I'm finding I just don't feel like eating the foods I would normally go for, and am wanting the healthier options. If this has happened in only 3 days, I figure it's only going to get better. For the first time ever I feel like there is hope.</p>
