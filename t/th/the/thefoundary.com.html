						Hayneedle, Inc. ("Hayneedle") understands and shares your concern about privacy. Please read this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to learn more about the manner in which we collect and use information that is generated when you visit thefoundary.com and its affiliated sites ("Site").
						<br><br>
						If you visit the Site and/or choose to create an account and/or place an order with us, we have designed our system to protect your privacy.  Our system will be able to ascertain your geographic location from your IP address, but we do not collect e-mail addresses or track the sites that you access while you use our services unless (i) we are required to do so by law; (ii) we have reason to believe that you have violated the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use; (iii) you have caused or attempted to cause harm to us or the other users of our Site; and/or (iv) you voluntarily provide us with personal information (as described below).<br><br>
						Two types of information may be collected when you visit our Site:
						<br><br>
						<strong>Aggregate information</strong> (such as log files/information about how many visitors log on to the Site and other non-identifying statistics), which is automatically collected from your use of the Site.  Our servers will log IP addresses and collect third party sites (and information from these sites) from your use of the Site.  Hayneedle uses this information to measure the use of our Site, to improve the content of our Site, and to provide our users with the best possible services.  Our Site may also use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.  
						We also collect passive information on products browsed via log files and we analyze this information in aggregate to ensure the Site is merchandised in a manner that adds the most convenience and value to our customers. 
						<br><br> 
						<strong>Personal information</strong> (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, password, or credit card information), which is only collected by us if you voluntarily submit it to us.  For instance, if you voluntarily place an order on the Site, we collect basic information including your name, home address, phone, email address and credit card information. We use this information to confirm and process your order, to keep you updated on the status of your order, and to respond to any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (freight carriers, shipping companies and product manufacturers) to process and ship your order. 
						If you voluntarily create an account with us on our Site, we collect basic information including your name, e-mail address and password so that we may better ensure that you receive streamlined service, e-mails from us, special discounts, faster checkout, order history, and other products, information and/or services you requested.		
						<br><br>
						In sum, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself.  However, to utilize the services offered by us, you can, if you choose, participate in additional secured applications.  For access to these applications, you are required to create an account with us.
						<br><br>
						In return for making a purchase or registering at the Site, we offer to keep you informed of new and ongoing benefits, exclusive sales and promotions and other customer-only benefits. We appreciate any additional, optional information you are willing to share with us. This optional information helps us tailor your experience at the Site, showing you content that we think might be interesting to you. Depending on the information you give us, we will also provide you with relevant information, gift ideas, and other special offers.
						<br><br>
						If you register at the Site, we include you in our list to receive email updates about special offers, new products and services, and relevant information. If for any reason you do not wish to receive this information or do not wish for us to provide information as described in this Privacy Policy, please visit the unsubscribe page by clicking on the link labeled "unsubscribe" on any e-mails you receive, or visit your account preferences at the Site to opt out. You may opt out of receiving future e-mails at any time.
						<br><br>
						Hayneedle does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide services that you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
						<br><br>
						We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
						<br><br>
						We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law. 
						<br><br>
						We may transfer information about you if Hayneedle is acquired by or merged with another organization.  In this event, Hayneedle will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
						<br><br>
						We may share information gleaned from your use of the Site or the purchases you make with companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships.
						<br><br>
						We share information with certain intermediaries (such as freight carriers, shipping companies and product manufacturers) where required to process and ship your order.
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Data Security</span>
						thefoundary.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information that we collect.  We utilize a firewall and use SSL encryption to keep your personal information secure.
						<br><br>
						Please note that unauthorized access of the Site is prohibited and punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Cookies</span>
						<br><br>
						We may also collect cookies.  Cookies are small files of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your Web browser.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change the preferences of your browser so that it does not accept them.  Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse the Site; however, in order to use all of the features of the Site and/or access all of the services and products, we recommend that you accept cookies.  
						For instance, our shopping cart requires the acceptance of cookies to work properly, and our Site may use cookies to keep track of items in your shopping cart so you do not need to re-enter them each time you visit.  The cookies we use do not contain or store sensitive customer information such as names, addresses, passwords or credit card numbers. 
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">"E-mail to a Freind" Feature</span>
						There are "e-mail to a friend" and "invite a friend" features on the Site that allow you to easily share product or other valuable information with your friends. We may retain these e-mail addresses and use them to process reward credits that you may earn when your friends open first time accounts and make purchases on the Site.  We may also use these e-mail addresses to facilitate current and future social networking features on the Site.  
						<br><br>
						If you are referred to the Site by a friend, your friend may be entitled to reward credits when you open your account and when you make purchases at the Site.  Your friend will be notified when you open your account and when you make purchases.  
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Links to Other Sites</span>
						<br><br>
						We provide links to a number of third-party external sites.  The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of the external site company, its Website or Websites, or the products or services it promotes or sells.  When you leave our Site to visit one of these linked sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from our Site.
						<br><br>
						Hayneedle is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of these third-party Websites.  You should consult the privacy policies at these Websites to determine how your information may be used.
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Children's Privacy</span>
						<br><br>
						We believe that protecting the privacy of children is especially important, and for that reason it is our intention to never collect or maintain information from children at our Site unless the disclosure of such information is done with verifiable parental or guardian consent.  If a visitor known to be a child (under the age of 13) sends an e-mail to us, we will only use it to respond to the e-mail writer and not to create an account or otherwise retain the information.
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Consent</span>
						<br><br>
						By using the Site, you consent to the collection and use of your information in the manner we describe.
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Modifications</span>
						<br><br>
						If we decide to change our Privacy Policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on the Site. Those changes will go into effect on the date posted in the notice and will apply to all users of the Site.
						<br><br>
						<span style="text-decoration:underline">Contact Us</span>
						<br><br>
						Please contact us at contact_us@hayneedle.com if you have further questions about our Privacy Policy or you have any suggestions on how we can improve your shopping experience at thefoundary.com.  We always enjoy hearing from you!
