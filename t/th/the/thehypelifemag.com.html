This Privacy Policy may be modified per its terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At TheHypeLifeMag.com, the privacy of our visitors is of extreme importance to us. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by TheHypeLifeMag.com and how it is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Information About Visitors to TheHypeLifeMag.com</strong></p>
<p>TheHypeLifeMag.com keeps track of TheHypeLifeMag.com, and pages our visitors view within TheHypeLifeMag.com, to enable TheHypeLifeMag.com to determine what sites and services are the most popular. This data can be used to deliver customized content and advertising to TheHypeLifeMag.com’s customers and other visitors to TheHypeLifeMag.com whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a specific subject area. TheHypeLifeMag.com’s service may automatically gather certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to TheHypeLifeMag.com and its pages, and TheHypeLifeMag.com will only use information gathered in this manner in the aggregate to enable TheHypeLifeMag.com to improve and better design TheHypeLifeMag.com.</p>
<p>Like many other Web sites, TheHypeLifeMag.com makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To facilitate the above, TheHypeLifeMag.com may use a technology called “cookies” – small files attached to your Web browser – which tell TheHypeLifeMag.com how and when pages in TheHypeLifeMag.com are visited, and by how many people. TheHypeLifeMag.com’s cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information, so users remain anonymous. TheHypeLifeMag.com may also provide statistical “ratings” information in the aggregate (and never about individual users personally) to TheHypeLifeMag.com’s partners about how visitors, collectively, use TheHypeLifeMag.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>TheHypeLifeMag.com may use “cookies” to personalize users’ online experience. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to users’ computers. Cookies are uniquely assigned to individual users, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued such cookies.</p>
<p>TheHypeLifeMag.com does use cookies to store information about visitors preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser.</p>
<p><strong>a. DoubleClick DART Cookie</strong> <br>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on TheHypeLifeMag.com.<br>Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to TheHypeLifeMag.com and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at the following URL - <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</strong></a></p>
<p>Some of our advertising partners may use cookies and web beacons on our site. Our advertising partners include <strong>Google Adsense</strong> and <strong>Pixazza</strong>.</p>
<p>Among the primary purposes of cookies is to indicate to TheHypeLifeMag.com’s Web server that a particular user has returned to a specific page and enables TheHypeLifeMag.com’s Web servers to “remember” such users from prior visits – including any preferences such users may have established during such prior visits. This simplifies the process of recording personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, etc. When a visitor returns to the same TheHypeLifeMag.com Web site, the information previously provided can be retrieved, so that such visitor can easily use TheHypeLifeMag.com’ features previously customized.</p>
<p>These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to the advertisements and links that appear on TheHypeLifeMag.com send directly to your browsers. They automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies ( such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons ) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and / or to personalize the advertising content that you see.</p>
<p>TheHypeLifeMag.com has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers.</p>
<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices. TheHypeLifeMag.com's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
<p>If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser options. More detailed information about cookie management with specific web browsers can be found at the browsers' respective websites.</p>
<p>Users have the ability and the right to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but users may be able to modify their browser settings to decline cookies or purchase third-party programs that provide such functionality. If a user chooses to decline cookies, such user may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of TheHypeLifeMag.com visited.</p>
