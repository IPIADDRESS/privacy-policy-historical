Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of the Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Site. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. BY USING THE SITE, YOU EXPLICITLY CONSENT TO SUCH USE OF YOUR INFORMATION AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 1, 2010.</p><p><b>1. Information We Automatically Collect.</b></p><p>We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how our users use the Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage Data"). For example, each time you visit the Site we may automatically collect your IP address, geographical location, browser and computer type, access time, the Web page from which you came, and the Web page(s) that you access during your visit. We also use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer’s hard drive) to keep track of your use of the Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password, and to improve the quality of the Site. In addition, third parties who place advertisements on the Site may also collect information through cookies to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly, to track geographical locations of users for the purpose of targeting advertising and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies<br> set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie. Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain areas of our Site may not function properly.</p><p><b>2. Information You Choose To Submit.</b></p><p>You can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could personally identify you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "<b>Personal Information</b>"). If, however, you wish to register to become a commenter on the Site, you are required to provide certain Personal Information (e.g., your username and e-mail address), and we ask that you also provide a password. We use your Personal Information to post your comments, to improve our services, and to contact you from time to time about us, our Site, and our products and services You may choose to submit your alias and photo to be shared with other users of the Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "<b>Shared Information</b>") in connection with your comments. In the event of any conflict or perceived conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Commenters’ Bill of Rights posted on the Site, this Privacy Policy supercedes and controls.</p><p><b>3. Our Information Sharing Practices</b></p><p>(a) Generally. Except as otherwise described in this section of our Privacy Policy, we will never share your Usage Data, Personal Information, or Shared Information (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "User Information") with any third party without your permission.</p><p>(b) Advertisers. We may share your Usage Data to enable third parties who serve advertisements on the Site to deliver advertisements that will be relevant to you. We will not share any such information, however, in a manner that would enable the advertiser to personally identify you.</p><p>(c) Aggregated Data. We may share aggregated User Information with third parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner that would enable the recipient to personally identify you.</p><p>(d) Service Providers. From time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., data management and storage services or credit card processing services). In those circumstances, we disclose User Information that is necessary for such service providers to perform those services and require that they maintain the confidentiality of such User Information.</p><p>(e) Other Disclosure Scenarios. Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share any User Information: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the Site’s infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); and (5) if we are acquired by<br> or merged with another entity.</p><p><b>4. Public Information.</b></p><p>If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly. For example, you may elect to make certain Shared Information (such as your alias and/or photo) publicly available. Also, there may be areas of the Site (e.g., comment sections) in which you are able to post information that will be available to all other users of the Site. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas.</p><p><b>5. Choice/Opt-Out. </b></p><p>We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from us. If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by sending an email to optout@fantasysportsventures.com. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process and that we are not responsible for removing information about you from the database of any third party to whom we were authorized to disclose your User Information prior to processing your request. Even if you do take advantage of this opportunity, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to the Site (e.g., about changes to this Privacy Policy or our <a href="http://thebiglead.com/?page_id=50112">Terms of Service</a>) and to contact you regarding any comments you have posted on the Site.</p><p><b>6. Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Information. </b></p><p>If you would like to modify or delete from our database any User Information you previously submitted to us, please let us know by sending an email detailing the information you would like modified or deleted to optout@fantasysportsventures.com. Please note that any User Information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your request, and that if you delete certain information you may not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such information.

Security. </b></p><p>We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your User Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its security.</p><p><b>8. Links.</b></p><p>The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such other website and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any information to such websites.</p><p><b>9.

Changes. </b></p><p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If under any such update we make any material change to the way in which we treat your User Information, we will inform you of such change via email or by posting a notice on relevant areas of the Site. Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date set forth therein.</p><p><b>Questions.</b></p><p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@fantasysportsventures.com">privacy@fantasysportsventures.com</a>.</p></div></div></div>﻿<div id="sidebar"><ul> <script>/*<![CDATA[*/document.write('<scr'+'ipt src=http://ad.doubleclick.net/adj/thebiglead.fsv/ros;sect=ros;fantasy=no;game=no;tile=3;sz=300x250;ord='+random_number+'?></scr'+'ipt>');/*]]>*/</script><script src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/adj/thebiglead.fsv/ros;sect=ros;fantasy=no;game=no;tile=3;sz=300x250;ord=7212155234?"></script> <noscript> <A HREF="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/thebiglead.fsv/ros;sect=ros;fantasy=no;game=no;tile=3;sz=300x250;ord='+random_number+'?" > <IMG SRC="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/thebiglead.fsv/ros;sect=ros;fantasy=no;game=no;tile=3;sz=300x250;ord='+random_number+'?" border="0" height="250" width="300"></A> </noscript><li><br><a href="http://thebiglead.com/index.php/fantasy-football-games-pickorplay/"><img src="http://thebiglead.fantasysportsven.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bls-pick-or-play-300x164.jpg" border="0"></a></li><li><h2>The Big Lead</h2><ul class="ulheader"> <b>Editor-in-Chief</b><li class="ulitem">Jason McIntyre<br> <a href="mailto:jmcintyre@thebiglead.com">E-mail</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/thebiglead" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li></ul><ul class="ulheader"> <b>Writers</b><li class="ulitem">Stephen Douglas<br> <a href="mailto:alumnigonzo@gmail.com">E-mail</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/crm_stephen" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li class="ulitem">Tyler Duffy<br> <a href="mailto:tyduffy@gmail.com">E-mail</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/tyduffy" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li class="ulitem">Tim Ryan<br> <a href="mailto:thesportshernia@yahoo.com">E-mail</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/thesportshernia" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li class="ulitem">Geoff Decker<br> <a href="mailto:geoffreydecker@gmail.com">E-mail</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/gethr0" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li><li class="ulitem">Jason Lisk<br> <a href="mailto:jkl1974@gmail.com">E-mail</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonlisk" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li></ul></li><br><div style="width:280px;
