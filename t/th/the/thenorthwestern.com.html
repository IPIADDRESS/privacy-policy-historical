<h1>thenorthwestern.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: March 2007</p>
<p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices 
  of thenorthwestern.com ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines 
  the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the thenorthwestern.com website (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use this 
  information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, 
  does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect 
  offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, 
  or through the mail).</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, 
  you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed 
  by this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://www.thenorthwestern.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. 
  Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy 
  at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy 
  Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect 
  the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such 
  changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
<h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" 
  law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain 
  from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information 
  (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the 
  preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list 
  of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and 
  addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately 
  preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to 
  make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:</p>
<p>Online Privacy Coordinator<br>
  Newspaper Division<br>
  7950 Jones Branch Drive<br>
  McLean, VA 22107</p>
<h3>How We Collect and Use Information</h3>
<p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily 
  supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding 
  via email to a feature provided on the Site).</p>
<p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you 
  navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about 
  your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, 
  to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the 
  Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a 
  "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small 
  files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. 
  By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, 
  identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. 
  They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas 
  of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site 
  also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent 
  GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open 
  HTML-formatted email messages.</p>
<p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in 
  a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and 
  advertising that appear on the Site. We also may provide your information to 
  third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for 
  a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described 
  below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of 
  the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in 
  any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide 
  you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information 
  to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy 
  Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting 
  to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes 
  or that may be given or sold to third-parties.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information 
  available for viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, 
  web logs, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be seen, collected 
  and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized 
  third-party use of such information.</p>
<p> Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present 
  advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web 
  beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers 
  may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to 
  help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. 
  The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers 
  and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and 
  is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these 
  third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have 
  any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons or use of your 
  information, you should visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.</p>
<p>The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products 
  and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. 
  When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services 
  through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy 
  policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such 
  products or services.</p>
<p>We also make some content, products and services available through our Site 
  through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands 
  of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, 
  products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information 
  you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that 
  are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, 
  the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases 
  the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's 
  use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ 
  from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of 
  our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for 
  more information.</p>
<p>We are an affiliate of the CareerBuilder online careers service. Through our 
  cooperative relationship with CareerBuilder, we are able to provide you with 
  access to the CareerBuilder products and services through a co-branded CareerBuilder 
  site. When you provide information through the co-branded CareerBuilder site, 
  CareerBuilder may share your information with us and we may use the information 
  consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Likewise, we are an affiliate of the Topix.net online news service, which enables 
  us to provide you with access to Topix.net products and services through a co-branded 
  Topix.net site. When you provide information through the co-branded Topix.net 
  site, Topix.net may share your information with us and we may use that information 
  in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when 
  release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="http://www.thenorthwestern.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>
  agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</p>
<p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. 
  In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more 
  of our websites is acquired by another company, information about our users 
  may be among the transferred assets.</p>
<h3>Children's Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the 
  online collection and use of personal information from children under the age 
  of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their rights under 
  federal law with respect to such information.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do 
    NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 
    the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide 
    personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from 
    providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently 
    received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 
    thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records. 
    If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable 
    parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information 
    from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.</li>
  <li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children 
    under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly distribute 
    such information to third parties.</li>
  <li>We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly 
    post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through 
    the Site.</li>
  <li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children 
    under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the participation 
    of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities on providing personally 
    identifiable information.</li>
</ul>
