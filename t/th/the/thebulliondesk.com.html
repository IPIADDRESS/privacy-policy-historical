You may contact any of these companies directly, or you can contact Euromoney by emailing <a href="mailto:dataprotectionofficer@euromoneyplc.com">dataprotectionofficer@euromoneyplc.com</a> or writing to the Data Protection Officer at Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, 8 Bouverie Street, London EC4Y 8AX, United Kingdom.

<h3>Our Approach to Your Privacy</h3>
<p>
	This Privacy Notice outlines the information we may collect about you in relation to your use of our products and services (“<strong>personal data</strong>”). It also explains the legal rights that you have in relation to your data and how you may exercise these rights.
</p>
<p>
	Some of our group companies may collect and use personal data for different purposes; those companies have their own websites and privacy notices.
</p>
<p>
	We will process your data for the following lawful purposes: with your consent; to fulfil our obligations to you; and where there is a legitimate interest to do so.
</p>
<p>
	When possible, we rely on your consent to use your data for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. We also process personal data to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, for example, when you register for any of our services, subscribe to a publication, sign-up for an event or purchase a product from us, we will need to process some of your personal data. This will also include details of the person/people responsible for payment (if different).
</p>
<p>
	We may determine that processing your personal data serves both of our legitimate interests. This is the case in relation to many of our research, customer survey, sales, marketing and advertising activities described in this Privacy Notice. These activities allow us to better understand your requirements, which in turn enables us to provide you with a better service. We review the bases for our processing decisions carefully and you can object to these activities at any time (see the “Your Rights” section of this Privacy Notice).
</p>

<h3>What Personal Data We Collect &amp; Why</h3>
<p>
	Our primary goal in collecting personal data from you is to give you a relevant customised experience of our products and services.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Registration, Free Trials &amp; Subscriptions</strong></h4>
		<p>
			When you register with our website and/or sign up for a free trial of our products or services, we may ask you to provide
			your name, address, email address and telephone number, and details relevant to your occupation or employer.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you subscribe to one of our products or services, we will also ask for payment details. Credit/debit card payments are
			processed using a third party supplier and we do not retain the credit card data (see the Third Party Sites of this Privacy
			Notice). Address details may be shared with third party service providers engaged by us for order fulfilment, delivery
			and payment collection. This personal data is used by us to complete subscription requests.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Events &amp; Conferences</strong></h4>
		<p>
			If you have registered for an event through a group website we may collect personal data including: name, job title, company,
			address, telephone number and email.
		</p>
		<p>
			This information is necessary so that we can complete your registration for the event and provide you with relevant event
			materials.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may also provide delegate details (e.g. name, email) to event sponsors who, subject to your consent, may contact you for
			their own advertising and marketing purposes.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Advertising &amp; Marketing</strong></h4>
		<p>
			We use the personal data you provide us and which we collect from you to inform you about similar products and services which
			we provide. We may send you marketing communications that are sponsored by our partners and which are targeted to your
			interests based on information you have provided us such as job title, employer and/or industry. If you have consented
			to receive information from other
			<a href="http://www.euromoneyplc.com/our-portfolio/group-companies">Euromoney group companies</a>, we may share your personal data with these companies so that they can fulfil your request
			to receive marketing materials in accordance with your preferences. We will not share your personal data with any third
			parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided your consent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of the Euromoney group companies that may contact you is a data controller in relation to the personal data that you
			have agreed to share with them. If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact the individual company, or us
			– using the contact details set out in the “Who We Are” section.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can opt out from receiving such materials at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The personal data we may use for advertising and marketing purposes includes your name, email address, job title, phone number,
			company name/employer, geo location, postal address and data collected using cookies and other similar technology (Please
			read our separate
			<a href="http://www.euromoneyplc.com/cookies">Cookies Policy</a> to find out more about which cookies we use, how they work and how you can control your cookie options).
		</p>
		<p>
			Marketing materials are sent electronically, by post and we may occasionally call you.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Online Targeted Advertising</strong></h4>
		<p>
			We use targeted advertising on our websites to display advertisements that are relevant to what we believe are your interests.
			In order to deliver relevant advertisements, we use third parties to deliver cookies that collect information about your
			IP address and how you interact with our sites (e.g. browsing information, which articles you have read etc.). This data
			is used by the third parties to determine which advertisements may be of interest to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may also share your personal data with third parties to deliver targeted advertising to you on other websites (e.g. Twitter
			Tailored Audiences or Facebook Custom Audiences). This could include your email address, cookie data, and information
			obtained from third parties. Third party cookies may also be used to enable us to target advertisements to you on other
			websites that you visit.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Lead Generation and Scoring</strong></h4>
		<p>
			We occasionally use the services of trusted third parties in order to ensure that the personal data we use for advertising
			and marketing purposes is accurate and up-to-date. To do this, we transfer personal data of individual leads (such as
			name, email, job title, location and phone number) to these third parties who conduct research to verify the data – primarily
			against public information.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also use algorithmic software technology to help us improve the quality and relevance of marketing activities. The personal
			data analysed by the software includes email address, phone number, job title, address, purchase history and account
			information. This allows us to provide meaningful offers that are relevant to your specific profile.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Surveys, Market Research &amp; Customer Feedback</strong></h4>
		<p>
			We want to understand the needs of our readers and customers. We may therefore use the information you provide us – including
			your name and contact details – to contact you to request your feedback, or to participate in our customer and market
			research.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Public forums, message boards and blogs</strong></h4>
		<p>
			Some of the pages on our group websites may include message boards, blogs or other facilities for generating content from
			users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when
			deciding to post any personal data. User generated content is also subject to our site
			<a href="http://www.euromoneyplc.com/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Business or Asset Sale</strong></h4>
		<p>
			If we sell a business or assets we may need to disclose your personal data to the prospective buyer of such business or assets.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Euromoney, or any of our group companies is sold or sells our assets or is acquired by a third party, then personal data
			about our customers will be acquired by that third party. A transfer of your personal data in these circumstances would
			be necessary so that the services you have contracted for can still be delivered, or so that you can continue to enjoy
			the benefits of our free products and services. You will receive notice if a new controller assumes responsibility for
			your personal data.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Additional Third Party Disclosures</strong></h4>
		<p>We may disclose your personal data to other third parties in the following situations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To third party partners who help us by providing services such as technology, marketing, advisory or other services.
				These third parties only receive encrypted data and may only process personal data to provide those services
				to us.</li>
			<li>Where we are required by law or regulation to do so. In each case we will seek, where practicable, to minimise the amount
				of data that is disclosed.</li>
			<li>If required to protect the rights and interests of other users and/or Euromoney and its affiliates (including our employees,
				agents and contractors), or as otherwise set out in our
				<a href="http://www.euromoneyplc.com/terms-and-conditions">Terms of Service</a>. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes
				of fraud protection.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Email Tracking</strong></h4>
		<p>
			We may include small pixel tags (small image files) within the emails we send you in order to determine whether our emails
			are opened and/or whether the hyperlinks inside our emails are clicked through. We may also collect browser, location
			and the device used to engage with our email communications. This information allows us to better understand whether
			we are meeting our users’ needs and how we can improve our communications. No other information is collected. You can
			opt out of receiving our direct marketing emails either by following the instructions in each email, or by contacting
			us (see the “<strong>Who We Are</strong>” section of this Privacy Notice).
			</p></li></ul>

<h3>International Transfers</h3>
<p>
	Some of the Euromoney group companies are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA). If you have consented to being
	contacted by our group companies, then the transfer of your personal data will be made according to the terms of an international
	data sharing agreement that contains obligations approved by European data protection regulators. Any of our group companies
	that receive your personal data will be co-controllers of that data, which means they may determine how they process
	your personal data – although they may only use it for the purposes for which it was shared, unless you are informed
	of new or additional processing activities.
</p>
<p>
	We may also transfer personal data to third party service providers as described in this Privacy Notice which are located
	outside the EEA. Where we conduct these transfers, we take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely
	and in accordance with applicable privacy legislation, either by only sending your personal data to jurisdictions that
	provide an adequate degree of legal protection for your data or by imposing approved contractual terms on these third
	parties.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Retention Periods</h3>
<p>
	We have a data retention policy that ensures we don’t use or store your personal data for longer than necessary. We consider
	the following issues to determine retention periods:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Guidance from the UK Information Commissioner or other regulatory agency, or industry best practice recommendations;</li>
	<li>The business rationale for collection and expiry of the purpose for which personal data was collected;</li>
	<li>Our ongoing ability to ensure the accuracy of the data; and</li>
	<li>Legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We may occasionally need to keep personal data for either shorter or longer periods than specified in our retention policy.
	In such circumstances, application of the retention period to the data will be temporarily suspended. The suspension
	of an applicable retention period will be carried out in a manner that respects the rights and interests of all persons
	concerned.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>How You Can Set Your Data &amp; Privacy Preferences</h3>
<p>
	You can use <a href="http://t.mail2.euromoneyplc.net/webApp/UpdatePreferences">our Preference Centre</a> to select the topics that are of interest to you so that we can send you publications and
	information about our products and services that are especially relevant to you. You can also choose the channels we
	use to contact you (email, phone, post, etc.) and can also opt-out of receiving marketing communications.
</p>

			recipients of your personal data, the applicable retention period and the data source. Copies of your personal data will
			be made available to you in a structured, machine-readable format.

			technically feasible for us to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have consented to our processing of your personal data, or if we are processing your personal data in order to fulfil
			our contractual obligations to you, then you can submit a request that we transfer your personal data to another data
			controller.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><strong>Rectification, Restriction, Objection</strong></h4>
		<p>
			You have the right to request that Euromoney rectify any errors in the personal data that we process. In some circumstances,
			you may also be able to ask for the erasure of personal data, and/or request that the processing of your personal data
			be restricted. You may also object to the processing of your personal data for sales or marketing purposes.

<h3>Protecting Your Data</h3>
<p>
	Euromoney is committed to keeping your personal data secure and we will take appropriate technical and organisational measures
	to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorised use, disclosure or destruction. Although we do our best to protect

	information security policies and rules, staff training on information security, and technical measures to ensure the
	integrity of data that we have under our control.
</p>
<p>
	All our employees, contractors and data processors (i.e. those third parties that process personal data on our behalf) are
	required to keep such data confidential and not to use it for any purpose other than the performance of services we have
	requested.

<p>
	Our site may contain links to other websites – including, for example, providers of payment processing services. Euromoney
