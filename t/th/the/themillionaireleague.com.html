      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">TheMillionaireLeague.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of   Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.   We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,   street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.   We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third   party. Period.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style52" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma">How we gather   information from users</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">How we collect and   store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which   you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be   asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of   our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a   purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and   contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our   site. Like most Web sites, our company also collects information automatically   and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.   For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie   technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other   things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from   having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the   number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our   site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,   but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be   asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to   customize the site's features according to your preferences.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style52" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma">What we do with the   information we collect</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">Like other Web   publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more   individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share   your information with anyone.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">Aggregated   Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in   many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns   with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and   services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most   attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our   advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any   Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you   individually.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">We may use Personally   Identifiable Information collected on TheMillionaireLeague.com to communicate   with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of   Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by TheMillionaireLeague.com and other topics   we think you might find of interest. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">Personally   Identifiable Information collected by TheMillionaireLeague.com may also be used   for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,   troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of   sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third   parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web   hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your   information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we   continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other   companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the   transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court   order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by   law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to   law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please   note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such   cases.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style52" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma">Affiliated sites,   linked sites and advertisements</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">TheMillionaireLeague.com expects its partners, advertisers and   affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third   parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content   providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data   collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site   you may link to, or view as part of a frame of content that is actually created   or hosted by a third party. Also, through our company web sites you may be   introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests   or sweepstakes offered by other parties. TheMillionaireLeague.com is not responsible for the actions or   policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies   of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated   by a third party.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">While on our site,   our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or   other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve   information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third   parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether   you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our   site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other   technology to gather information. TheMillionaireLeague.com does not control   the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is   not responsible for any actions or policies of such third   parties.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">You should also be   aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on   message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can   be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in   unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities   are beyond the control of TheMillionaireLeague.com and this   policy.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style52" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma">Children</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">TheMillionaireLeague.com does not knowingly collect or solicit   Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 18 except as   permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child   under 18 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information   immediately. If you believe TheMillionaireLeague.com has any information from or about anyone   under 18, please contact us using the link contact link below.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">TheMillionaireLeague.com reserves the right to change this policy at   any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of   our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept   those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will   be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information   was collected.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style52" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Tahoma">Governing   law</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">This policy and the   use of this Site are governed by the law. If a dispute arises under this Policy   we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon   mediator. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the   mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">If it proves   impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we   agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by the   arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style50" style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Tahoma">This statement and   the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any   contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
