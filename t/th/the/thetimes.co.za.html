<p>Please note that other websites you visited before entering our website might place personal data within your URL during a visit to it, and we have no control over such websites. Accordingly, a subsequent website that collects URL information may log some personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Our website uses cookies. To find out more about what cookies are, when and why we use them, and how you can manage them during your visit to or use of our website, please read our cookie policy, <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/cookie-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which you can find here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Web beacons</strong></p>
<p>Our website may contain electronic image requests (called a <b>single-pixel GIF</b> or <b>web beacon</b> request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page (including an ad banner) can act as a web beacon. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any of your personal data. We merely use them to compile anonymous information about our website.</p>
<p><strong>Optional details</strong></p>
<p>You may also provide additional information to us on a voluntary basis (<b>optional information</b>). This includes content or products that you decide to upload or download from our website or when you enter competitions, take advantage or promotions, respond to surveys, order certain additional goods or services, or otherwise use the optional features and functionality of our website.</p>
<p><strong>Recording calls</strong></p>
<p>We may monitor and record any telephone calls that you make to us, unless you specifically request us not to.</p>
<h2><strong>Purpose for collection of data</strong></h2>
<p>We may use or process any services information, or optional information that you provide to us for the purposes that you indicated when you agreed to provide it to us. Processing includes gathering your personal data, disclosing it, and combining it with other personal data. We generally collect and process your personal data for various purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>services purposes</b> – such as providing our services;</li>
<li><b>marketing purposes</b> – such as pursuing lawful related marketing activities, including business intelligence (including website activity and market research);</li>
<li><b>business purposes</b> – such as internal audit, accounting, business planning, and joint ventures, disposals of business, or other proposed and actual transactions; and</li>
<li><b>legal purposes</b> – such as handling claims, complying with regulations, or pursuing good governance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use your usage information for the purposes described above and to:</p>
<ul>
<li>remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the website;</li>
<li>monitor website usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and</li>
<li>track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities in connection with your usage of the website.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Consent to collection of data</strong></h2>
<p>We will obtain your consent to collect personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>in accordance with applicable law;</li>
<li>when you provide us with any registration information or optional information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use of data</h2>
<p><strong>Our obligations</strong></p>
<p>We may use your personal data to fulfil our obligations to you. This could include delivering newspapers to you, allowing you to access exclusive content on our website, billing you for our services, or improving our offerings.</p>
<p><strong>Messages and updates</strong></p>
<p>We may send administrative messages and email updates to you about the website. We may wish to provide you with information about new goods or services in which we think you may be interested. This means that in some cases, we may also send you primarily promotional messages. We will not send you promotional messages unless you have chosen to opt in to receive them. You can choose to opt out of receiving promotional messages.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted content</strong></p>
<p>While you are logged into the website, we may display targeted adverts and other relevant information based on your personal data. In a completely automated process, computers process the personal data and match it to adverts or related information. We never share personal data with any advertiser, unless you specifically provide us with your consent to do so.</p>
<p>Advertisers receive a record of the total number of impressions and clicks for each advert. They do not receive any personal data. If you click on an advert, we may send a referring URL to the advertiser’s website identifying that a customer is visiting from the website. We do not send personal data to advertisers with the referring URL. Once you are on the advertiser’s website, however, the advertiser is able to collect your personal data.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of data</h2>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
<ul>
<li>other divisions or companies within the group of companies to which we belong to provide joint content and services like registration, for transactions and customer support, to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about our products, services, and communications (they will only use this information to send you marketing communications if you have requested their goods or services);</li>
<li>an affiliate, in which case we will seek to require the affiliates to honour this privacy policy;</li>
<li>our goods suppliers or service providers under contract who help supply certain goods or help with parts of our business operations, including fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services (our contracts dictate that these goods suppliers or service providers only use your information in connection with the goods they supply to us or services they perform for us and not for their own benefit);</li>
<li>credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law;</li>
<li>banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you utilise the services to receive payments and you meet their criteria);</li>
<li>social media platforms when you use tools or functionality on our website provided by those platforms (such as "recommend" or "share" buttons); and</li>
<li>other third parties who provide us with relevant services where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regulators</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal data as required by law or governmental audit.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose personal data if required:</p>
<ul>
<li>by a subpoena or court order;</li>
<li>to comply with any law;</li>
<li>to protect the safety of any individual or the general public; and</li>
<li>to prevent violation of our customer relationship terms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No selling</strong></p>
<p>We will not sell personal data. No personal data will be disclosed to anyone except as provided in this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>No linked websites</strong></p>
<p>We do not share personal data with any websites linked to on our site, unless they are a party with whom we are allowed to share personal data, as indicated in this policy. Please check these websites’ own privacy policies before sharing your personal data with them.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing purposes</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics (information about the customer population in general terms) about the personal data to advertisers or business partners.</p>
<p><strong>Employees</strong></p>
<p>We may need to disclose personal data to our employees that require the personal data to do their jobs. These include our responsible management, human resources, accounting, audit, compliance, information technology, or other personnel. Any of our employees or personnel that handle your personal data will have signed non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Change of ownership</strong></p>
<p>If we undergo a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we may assign our rights to the personal data we process to a successor, purchaser or separate entity. We will disclose the transfer on the website. If you are concerned about your personal data migrating to a new owner, you may request us to delete your personal data.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take the security of personal data very seriously and always do our best to comply with applicable data protection laws.

<p>We may retain your personal data in physical or electronic records at our discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer to another country</strong></p>
<p>We may transmit or transfer personal data outside the country in which it was collected to a foreign country and process it in that country. Personal data may be stored on servers located outside the country in which it was collected in a foreign country whose laws protecting personal data may not be as stringent as the laws in the country in which it was collected. You consent to us processing your personal data in a foreign country whose laws regarding processing of personal data may be less stringent.</p>

<ul>
<li>where we can show legitimate grounds for processing your personal data that override your request; or</li>
<li>where we process your personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may request that we restrict the use of your personal data. When we restrict your personal data we still have the right to store it but not use it. You can ask that we do this verbally or in writing (which writing may be in an electronic form) via the forums described in this policy. We will respond to the request within 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Data portability</strong></p>
<p>If you should wish to transfer your data from us to another data controller, we will facilitate this transfer. We will pass on all of our personal data to the data controller.</p>
<p>If you are a data subject of one of our customers (who is the data controller), then you must submit your request for your personal data to the relevant data controller, who will then export your personal data as a Microsoft Excel or CSV file.</p>
<p><b>Data breaches</b></p>
<p>We will notify our customers of any confirmed data breaches that has occurred. It is our customers’ responsibility to notify relevant supervisory authorities and any affected data subjects of the data breach.</p>
