			<h3>TheoremReach Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>TheoremReach is a market research and surveying company that works with 
			companies such as advertisers and market researchers to poll people on their 
			opinions and preferences. TheoremReach believes in and respects the sanctity of 
			your privacy.</p>
			<p>The information we collect is typically used in aggregate form to help companies 
			understand marketplace needs as well as to create and deliver better products and 
			services. We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h3>What do we collect?</h3>
			<p>We collect the responses that you submit to our multiple choice surveys. In rare 
			instances, we may ask if you want to provide your email address and/or mobile 
			phone number for additional follow-up. If we do this, it is for our own internal 
			use only, unless we explicitly list who the information will be passed through to, 
			such as if you opt to visit a Lexus dealership for a test drive. We will never disclose 
			your information to any other company entity without disclosing it to you, unless 
			required by law.</p>

			<h3>How do we use these responses?</h3>
			<p>We analyze and aggregate them to find insights and trends in groups of responses, 
			for advertisers, market researchers, and polling parties, such as for election 
			estimates or to see if people like Coca Cola or Pepsi more.</p>

			<p>Survey Response Data. We may sell, license, or share the Survey Responses and Response Metadata (collectively, the “Response Data”) and related information with survey creators and researchers (i.e., our customers). We may aggregate your Response Data with Response Data collected from other users through the Services and share such aggregated data with third parties, including our advisors, investors, and/or customers. Additionally, we may share Response Data we collect with third parties in connection with the use and operation of the Services and other aspects of our business (e.g., with our customers, agents, advisors, consultants, advertisers, business partners, investors and/or vendors).</p>

			<h3>Can you access your responses?</h3>
			<p>If you wish to access, modify, or remove your historic responses at any point in 
			time, simply email privacy@theoremreach.com and include your device ID with a 
			message letting us know what you would like us to do with your responses.</p>

			<h3>Personal Information about Respondents</h3>
			<p>In the course of responding to our surveys, you may have the opportunity to 
			voluntarily submit personally identifiable information (e.g., e-mail address or 
			mobile phone number). TheoremReach maintains this information in a database, 
			and may use this information to invite you to participate in future surveys, subject 
			to agreement with the authoring and the respondent-providing client and your 
			explicit opt-in to receive e-mail or mobile communications. Your decision to 
			participate in future surveys is completely at your discretion. That is, you have no 
			obligation to complete this or any future survey. By participating in a survey you 
			understand and consent to this policy.</p>

			<h3>Notice to Children and Young People</h3>
			<p>TheoremReach does not collect nor keep personally identifiable information from 
			anyone under the age of 13.</p>

			<h3>Use of Cookies and Device IDs</h3>
			<p>To invite you to participate in surveys that may be of great interest to you and to 
			enable you to use our service, we use a hashed version of your device ID -- a unique 
			identifier of your mobile device that is coded and anonymized. In some cases, when 
			you take our survey from a mobile browser, we will place “cookies” on your mobile 
			device. Cookies are small text files that your browser stores on your device and 
			are commonly used by web sites to provide you with an enhanced experience by 
			remembering you from previous visits. Our cookies do not contain any personally 
			identifying information, but they enable us to understand the surveys you may have 
			taken. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your 
			browser to inform you or prevent the use of cookies. If you do not accept cookies, 
			you may not be able, depending upon the individual survey, to complete more than 
			the first set of questions in a survey. </p>

			<p>If you would like to opt-out from either storing your device ID or accepting our 
			cookies, or if you would like to opt out of both of these enhancements, click here.</p>

			<h3>Log Files</h3>
			<p>Like most online and mobile companies, we log the use of our service. This includes 
			Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), 
			referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks in order 
			to administer the survey, track aggregate movement, analyze trends, and gather 
			broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to 
			personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
			<p>When you supply any personally identifiable information, such as an email address 
			or phone number, during the course of completing a survey it may be shared with 
			a third party company who has been hired by us to provide services to help us with 
			our business activities such as product fulfillment and follow-up information. These 
			companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to 
			provide these services to us. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary 
			and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p>

			<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
			<p>We are sensitive to the privacy and security of your personal information. However, 
			we cannot guarantee absolute security as such information may be transmitted 
			using the Internet, other public telecommunication networks, servers, hardware or 
			software ("systems") that are not owned, operated, or controlled by us.</p>

			<h3>Compliance with Legal Proceedings</h3>
			<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose 
			personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief 
			that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or 
			legal process served to us.</p>

			<h3>Contact Information</h3>
			<p>If you have any questions about this policy, TheoremReach, general online 
			and mobile practices, or how we survey, please feel free to reach us at 
			admin@theoremreach.com.</p>
