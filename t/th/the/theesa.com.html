        <p>The Entertainment Software Association, and its subsidiaries and  affiliates (collectively, "ESA") respect the privacy rights of our  online visitors and recognizes the importance of protecting all  information that you may choose to share with us.&nbsp; To further this  commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy  Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you  provide us. </p>
        <p>This Privacy Statement and the certification seal shown on this page  confirms that ESA is a member in good standing of ESRB's Privacy Online  Program.&nbsp; ESRB's Privacy Online Program is designed to ensure that our  Web site's information disclosure practices are responsible and  appropriate.&nbsp; To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken  this privacy initiative and all of our Web sites have been reviewed and  certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information  collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are  subject to frequent audits of our Web sites and other enforcement and  accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB. </p>

        <h4><br>
          <a name="1" id="1"></a>What information does this Privacy Statement cover?</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected  on the Web sites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply  to any other information collected by ESA through any other means. </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to use and sharing of personal  information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is  posted. </p>
        <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information  submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that  may be collected by ESA offline.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies only to  Web sites maintained by ESA, and not to our international affiliates, or  any websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we  link.&nbsp; ESA is therefore not responsible for the content or activities  provided on those websites. </p>
        <p>Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws. </p>
        <h4><a name="2" id="2"></a>What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</h4>
        <p>We don't require personal information to access our Web site.&nbsp;  However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you will  not be able to enjoy certain features of our Web site.&nbsp; Personal  information is information that identifies you and may be used to  contact you.&nbsp; To offer our guests certain features on our Web site, we  collect several types of personal information. </p>
        <p><em>Children<br>
        </em>We don't knowingly collect personal information from children  under 13.&nbsp; We take kids privacy seriously, and encourage parents to  play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. </p>
        <p><em>Information You Provide to Us</em><br>
        All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests.&nbsp; We collect personal information from our guests to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participate in polls, surveys, and questionnaires </li>
          <li>Use e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend features </li>
          <li>Purchase a product at one of our online stores </li>
          <li>Participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions </li>
          <li>Report piracy, offer feedback, or other business inquiries </li>
          <li>Receive customer or technical support </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typically, this information includes: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>E-mail Address </li>
          <li>Telephone Number </li>
          <li>Shipping and Billing address, and </li>
          <li>For those purchasing products online, credit card information. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, we may also collect other types of non-personal  information (known as demographic information) such as your age or date  of birth, gender, marital status, hobbies, platform preferences, and  other game ownership and preferences.&nbsp; This demographic information may  be associated with your personal information. </p>
        <p><em>Information Collected Through Technology <br>
        </em>We collect information through technology to make our Web sites  more interesting and useful to you.&nbsp; For example, when you come to one  of our Web sites, we collect your IP address.&nbsp; An IP address is often  associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like  your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your  university.&nbsp; Standing alone, your IP address is not personally  identifiable.&nbsp; At times, we also use IP addresses to collect  information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various  parts of our Web sites.&nbsp; We may combine this information with personally  identifiable information. </p>
        <p><em>Cookies </em><br>
        Our Web sites also use cookies.&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information that  a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. We  and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.&nbsp; For  example, when you return to one of our Web sites after logging in,  cookies provide information to the Web site so that the Web site will  remember who you are.&nbsp; You can choose to have your computer warn you  each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all  cookies.&nbsp; You can do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator  or Internet Explorer) settings.&nbsp; Each browser is a little different, so  look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your  cookies.&nbsp; If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many  features that make your web experience smoother, like the features  mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly. </p>
        <p><em>Web Beacons</em> <br>
        Our Web sites use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes,  including Web beacons.&nbsp; Web beacons are small pieces of data that are  embedded in images on the pages of Web sites.&nbsp; We also use these  technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such  as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our  websites.&nbsp; These technical methods may involve the transmission of  information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us  to collect information on our behalf.&nbsp; We also use these technical  methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether  our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those  e-mails.&nbsp; The information from use of these technical methods may be  collected in a form that is personally identifiable. </p>
        <p><em>Network Advertisers <br>
        </em>Many advertisements are managed and placed on our Web sites by  third parties.&nbsp; These companies are called "network advertisers."&nbsp;  Network advertisers who place advertisements on our Web sites may also  use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable  information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their  banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being  collected.&nbsp; In some cases, we may have access to information from Web  beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this  information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited  that are also associated with the network advertiser. </p>
        <p>Finally, once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our  Web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the  privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information  will be handled on their Web site. </p>
        <h4><a name="3" id="3"></a>How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</h4>
        <p>We don't share, sell, or rent your personal information to third  parties without your consent.&nbsp; We don't require personal information to  access our Web site.&nbsp; However, if you prefer not to disclose personal  information, you will not be able to enjoy certain features of our  Web site. </p>
        <p>Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the  extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate  business objectives. </p>
        <p><em>ESA Tools and Updates <br>
        </em>Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to  us is used to provide services like updates on special events, game  news, and email announcements of interest to our users.&nbsp; Occasionally,  we share your personal information (e.g., e-mail address) with a third-party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party that provides  products or services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; Moreover, if you  register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your  personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the  boards.&nbsp; However, you should understand that community forums, blogs,  and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members  of the online community.&nbsp; As such, whenever you give out personal  information in public areas, that information can be collected and used  by people you don't know. </p>
        <p><em>Operational Uses</em> <br>
        We may also use your personal information for other purposes such as  "Operational Uses."&nbsp; For example, we may use your information to send  you administrative communications either about your account with us or  about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to this  Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p>We occasionally use other companies, agents or contractors to  perform services necessary to our operations.&nbsp; For example, we have  partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages, process  credit card transactions, analyze customers' interaction with our  website, and process consumer surveys.&nbsp; We also provide postal  addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes.&nbsp; In the course  of providing such services, these companies may have contact with your  personally identifying information.&nbsp; These entities have agreed to  securely store and maintain the personal information received from us. </p>
        <p><em>Aggregate Information</em> <br>
        Finally, we may take your personally identifiable information and make  it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information  about other individuals (aggregating your information with information  about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your  name) that make the information personally identifiable to you  (de-personalizing your information).&nbsp; Given the nature of this  information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our  right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we  may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting  non-personally identifiable information. </p>
        <p><em>Business Information</em> <br>
        For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in  a business capacity different from information we receive in a  non-business capacity.&nbsp; Personal information submitted to us in a  business capacity (e.g. resumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared  with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. </p>
        <p><em>Purchase or Sale of Businesses <br>
        </em>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or  more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may  be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.&nbsp; If we purchase a  business, the personally identifiable information received with that  business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it  is practicable and permissible to do so.&nbsp; If we sell a business, we  will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser  to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner  required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this  Privacy Policy).&nbsp; The provisions of this paragraph will also apply if  we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
        <p><em>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Websites and Others <br>
        </em>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good  faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for  example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to:  enforce our Terms of Use; enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions,  and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the  safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect  the safety and security of our Web sites or third parties. </p>
        <h4><a name="4" id="4"></a>What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information  you submit to us.&nbsp; If at any time you decide to remove your personal  information from our database, you may do so by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@theesa.com">privacy@theesa.com</a>. </p>
        <h4><a name="5" id="5"></a>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</h4>
        <p>The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely  important to us.&nbsp; We have implemented technical, administrative, and  physical security measures to protect your personal information from  unauthorized access and improper use.&nbsp; From time to time, we review our  security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and  methods.&nbsp; However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no  security measure is perfect or impenetrable. </p>
        <h4><a name="6" id="6"></a>How can you update your personal information and profile?</h4>
        <p>You can access and update the contact information you gave us during  registration (that is, your e-mail address or any other information  that would directly enable us to contact you), by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@theesa.com">privacy@theesa.com</a>. </p>
        <p><em>Your California Privacy Rights</em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our  customers who are California residents to request certain information  regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for  their direct marketing purposes. For inquires regarding our disclosure  policy, please write us: </p>
