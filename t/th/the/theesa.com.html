        <p>Please  note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and  collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by  ESA offline.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies only to Web sites maintained by  ESA, and not to our international affiliates, or any web sites maintained by  other companies or organizations to which we link.&nbsp; ESA, therefore, is not  responsible for the content or activities provided on those web sites. </p>

<h4><a name="2" id="2"></a>What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</h4>
        <p>We  don't require personal information to access our Web sites.&nbsp; However, if  you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy  certain features of our Web site.&nbsp; Personal information is information  that identifies you and may be used to contact you.&nbsp; To offer our guests  certain features on our Web site, we may collect several types of personally  identifiable information.</p>
        <p><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></p>
        <p>All of the personal information we  receive comes directly from our guests.&nbsp; We may collect personal  information from our guests to: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Participate in contests,       sweepstakes, or other promotions </li>
          <li>Report piracy, offer feedback,       or other business inquiries</li>
          <li>Sign up to receive newsletters       (such as ESA Tools and Updates)</li>
          <li>Join the Video Game Voters       Network </li>
          <li>Receive customer or technical       support </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This  information may include: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>E-mail Address </li>
          <li>Telephone Number </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Children</em></p>
        <p>We  don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.&nbsp; We  take kidsâ€™ privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in  their children's online experience at all times. </p>
        <p><em>Information Collected Through  Technology </em></p>
        <p>We  collect information through technology to make our Web sites more interesting  and useful to you.&nbsp; For example, when you come to one of our Web sites, we  collect your IP address.&nbsp; An IP address often is associated with the  portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service  provider), your company or your university.&nbsp; Standing alone, your IP  address is not personally identifiable.&nbsp; At times, we also use IP  addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests  visit various parts of our Web sites.&nbsp; We do not combine the information  collected through technology with your personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><em>Cookies </em></p>
        <p>Our  Web sites also use cookies.&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information that a Web  site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. We and other  companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.&nbsp; For example, when you  return to one of our Web sites after logging in, cookies provide information to  the Web site so that the Web site will remember who you are.&nbsp; You can  choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you  can choose to turn off all cookies.&nbsp; You can do this through your browser  (like Internet Explorer) settings.&nbsp; Each browser is a little different, so  look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your  cookies.&nbsp; If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features  that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and  some of our services may not function properly. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="3" id="3"></a>How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</h4>
        <p>We  don't share, sell or rent your personal information to third parties without  your consent.&nbsp; We don't require disclosure of personal information to  access our Web sites, except for Gameoverpirates.com, which is only accessible  by law enforcement and ESA member companies.&nbsp; If you prefer not to  disclose any personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain  features of our Web site. </p>
        <p>We  will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill  your requests and our legitimate business objectives. </p>
        <p><em>ESA  Tools and Updates </em></p>
        <p>Information  collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide  services like updates on special events, game news and e-mail announcements of  interest to our users. We do not share your personally identifiable information  with third party marketers.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
        <p><em>Operational  Uses</em> </p>
        <p>We  may also use the personal information you provide to us for other  "Operational Uses."&nbsp; For example, we may use your information to  send you administrative communications either about your account with us or  about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to this Privacy  Policy. </p>
        <p><em>Third Parties</em></p>
        <p>We  occasionally use third parties (other companies, agents or contractors) to  perform services necessary to our operations.&nbsp; For example, we have  partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages, analyze customers'  interaction with our Web site, send newsletters and process consumer  surveys.&nbsp; We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for  delivery purposes.&nbsp; In the course of providing such services, these private,  third party companies may have contact with your personally identifiable  information and have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal  information received from us and only use your personally identifiable  information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><em>Business  Information</em> </p>
        <p>For  practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business  capacity different from information we receive in a non-business  capacity.&nbsp; Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity  (e.g., resumes, event sponsorship) may be shared with third parties, depending  on the nature of the inquiry. </p>
        <p><em>Purchase  or Sale of Businesses </em></p>
        <p>From  time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses  and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of  the purchase or sale.&nbsp; If we purchase a business, the personally  identifiable information received with that business would be treated in  accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do  so.&nbsp; If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling  contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable  information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any  amendments to this Privacy Policy).&nbsp; The provisions of this paragraph also  will apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
        <p><em>Disclosures  Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our  Web sites and Others </em></p>
        <p>We  will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such  disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a  court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our terms of use; enforce  contests, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or  security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you;  and/or protect the safety and security of our Web sites or third parties. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="4" id="4"></a>What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</h4>
        <p>As  mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to  us.&nbsp; If at any time you decide to remove your personal information from  our database, you may do so by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@theesa.com">privacy@theesa.com</a>. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="5" id="5"></a>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</h4>
        <p>The  security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to  us.&nbsp; We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security  measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and  improper use.&nbsp; We use industry standard  practices such as physically secured rooms and password protection systems to  safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information.&nbsp; We will notify users of a data breach  involving unencrypted personal information by e-mail or by posting a notice on  the affected Web site. &nbsp; From time to time, we review our security  procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.&nbsp; However,  please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is  perfect or impenetrable. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="6" id="6"></a>How can you update your personal information and profile?</h4>
        <p>You  can access and update the contact information you gave us during registration  (that is, your e-mail address or any other information that would directly  enable us to contact you), by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@theesa.com">privacy@theesa.com</a>. </p>
<p><em>Your California Privacy Rights</em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since  2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are  California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of  personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
