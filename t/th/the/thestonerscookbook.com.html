If you are already logged into the Services and Facebook or another social networking service, when you click on “Connect with Facebook,” or a similar connection on another social networking service, you will be prompted to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into the Services but not logged into Facebook or another social networking service that we support, when you click on “Connect with Facebook,” or a similar connection on another social networking service, you will be prompted to enter your social networking service credentials or to “Sign Up” for the social networking service. By proceeding, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook or other social networking service’s Terms of Use in your use of the Services. Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a user of the Services, and you click on “Sign in” using Facebook or another social networking service that we support, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook or social networking service credentials and then be given the option to register for the Services. In this case, we may receive information from Facebook or another social networking service to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Websites or Services and show our relevant content from your Facebook or social networking service friends. Once you register on the Websites or Services and connect with Facebook or another social networking service, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other social networking service. Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other social networking service account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that social networking service, so please consult the social networking service’s privacy and data practices. You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into your Account through the Websites or Services and going to settings, “About Me,” “Linked Accounts,” and then unselecting “Facebook.” Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect your Services activity stream by visiting the Facebook Applications Settings page.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Information Collected via Technology.<ul class="jsx-1267753626"><li class="jsx-1267753626">Information Collected by Our Servers. To make the Websites or Services and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Websites and Services, track users’ movements around the Websites and Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Website or Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Websites or Services. This type of information is collected to make the Website and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Collection of Data by Advertisers. We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Websites or Services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Websites or Services (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number). They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Websites and Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.

When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies.

This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the mobile applications, and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event our mobile applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our mobile applications. This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Analytics Services and Interest-Based Advertising.

Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, any public postings or other communications you have made on the Websites or Services such as in forums or blogs cannot generally be removed. When you edit your personal information or change your preferences on the Websites or Services, information that you remove may persist internally for our own administrative purposes. If you completely delete all of your Personal Data, then your user account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</li><li class="jsx-1267753626">Applications. You can stop all collection of information by the mobile applications by uninstalling the mobile applications. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. To serve ads in our mobile applications where Cookie technology is not available, the HERB hashes users’ device ID. Users may choose to reset or opt out of anonymous IDs at any time. If users choose to opt out, ads delivered to the mobile applications by ad serving technology will not be served on an anonymous ID.</li></ol><h2 class="jsx-1267753626">9. SECURITY OF CREDIT CARD AND BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h2><p class="jsx-1267753626">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes using Security Sockets Layers (SSL) software, which is software that encrypts the information you input. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. To most efficiently serve you when placing orders through our Transactable Sites site, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking managers, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. Within the Transactable Sites, your information is kept on password protected, limited access servers. Wherever possible and applicable, the Transactable Sites’ servers reside behind a corporate firewall that maintains controls on access to the system from both our internal network and the Internet.</p><h2 class="jsx-1267753626">10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2><p class="jsx-1267753626">This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any material changes in the way we use your Personal Data, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Websites or Services. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Websites or Services. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Service. Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your Personal Data to provide us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Data, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us. Continued use of the Websites or Services, following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes</p></div></article><div><footer class="jsx-3941408052 flex flex-col"><a href="https://shop.herb.co" target="_blank" class="jsx-3941408052"><div class="jsx-3941408052 shop-floater">SHOP
