<b>Our Policies:</b></p><p>

--Use of collected Information</p><p>

During the process of delivering an ad to you, Innovate it does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Innovate it does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by Innovate it is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. 
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, Innovate it may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Innovate it may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.</p><p>

--Cookies</p><p>

Innovate it, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. Innovate it cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time Innovate it serves you an ad. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Innovate it target ads to you. This cookie can help Innovate it ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for Innovate it to deliver you an ad. If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p><p>

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p><p>

In some instances We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.</p><p>
