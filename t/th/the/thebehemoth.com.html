EFFECTIVE DATE: May 22nd 2018<br><br>

The Behemoth ('The Behemoth,' 'we' or 'us') values the privacy of its online visitors, and hopes that the following statement helps you understand how The Behemoth collects, uses, discloses and safeguards the personal information you provide us through our web site, <a href="https://www.thebehemoth.com">www.TheBehemoth.com</a>, and its pages (the 'Site'), as well as games, including online features of games, and any authorized mobile app operated by or at the direction of The Behemoth that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the 'Service').
<br><br>

<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>Information The Behemoth Collects:</u></b></font>
<br><br>
When you visit the Site or use the Service, The Behemoth may collect certain personal information. Personal information is information that is not otherwise publicly available, and may include such things as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, and other information that you provide to us. If you choose to correspond with The Behemoth through e-mail, The Behemoth reserves the right to retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and The Behemoth's responses. Do not submit information that you do not want The Behemoth to access.  As further described below, we may also collect non-personal information when you interact with the Site and Service such as information about your usage of the Site and Service.
<br><br>
<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>How The Behemoth Uses Your Information</u></b></font>
<br><br>
The Behemoth may use personal information to provide information and services to you and to allow The Behemoth to (i) respond to questions and comments; (ii) analyze and monitor your use of the Site and the Service; (iii) promote, operate and support The Behemoth products and services, including to send you newsletters and periodic promotional materials; (iv) develop a knowledge base regarding its users; (v) process orders; (vi) improve the Site and Services; (vii) use for internal business purposes; (viii) inform appropriate authorities if deemed necessary; and (ix) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal information.
<br><br>
<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>How The Behemoth Discloses Your Information to Third Parties:</u></b></font>
<br><br>
The Behemoth may disclose personal information as necessary to operate the Service, including in response to law enforcement activity, to enforce its contract or property rights, or when required by law. 
<br><br>
Information collected may also be transferred in connection with the sale or merger of the company (or substantially all of its assets) or any division or business line of the company to which the information relates or to any subsequent operator of the Site or Service.
<br><br>
The Behemoth may hire third parties to perform services on its behalf in connection with operating the Site or Service in accordance with applicable law.
<br><br>
If you direct any of your information, including personal information, to be shared with third parties, such as social media sites, third party mobile applications, and similar services, The Behemoth will have no control over these third party uses of your information.
<br><br>
In addition to the disclosures set forth above, The Behemoth may aggregate or de-identify information about its users. Such aggregated or de-identified information may, in a manner that is not personally identifiable, be disclosed to third parties (including advertisers) for marketing, promotional, research, and other purposes. 
<br><br>
In those cases where de-identified data is shared with third parties, the third parties will not be able to identify any individual user of the Site or Service based on the disclosures.  
<br><br>
<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>Passive information collection:</u></b></font>
<br><br>
The Behemoth may use different technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, and location-identifying technologies, to passively collect information.  The information collected might include the date and time you visit the Site, logs from your browser or your use of the Service, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the pages you requested.  This information will usually be used to (i) customize the advertising and content you see, (ii) process and confirm your entries and order information, (iii) contact you, (iv) enhance your experience, and/or (v) improve our general user experience. Your browser must be set up to accept cookies in order to fully utilize certain areas of the Site.
<br><br>
The Behemoth has the right to gather non-personal information regarding you, your game play activities, game usage, or preferences, THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES OR OTHER MEANS, without any additional notice to you or affirmative actions taken by you BEYOND USING ANY OF THE SITE OR SERVICE.

Such information may be collected whether or not you register for an account with The Behemoth.  Such information may also be collected while you are offline and may be transmitted to The Behemoth when you next connect to the Internet, regardless of the location where or device through which that connection is established.  The Behemoth reserves the right to compile, save and use such information within the scope of The Behemoth's business activities, and analyze any and all of the data collected in this manner. The data collected by The Behemoth may be posted on websites accessible to the public; shared with console manufacturers, software developers, and/or marketing partners; or used by The Behemoth for any other lawful purpose. By using the Site and Service you consent to The Behemoth's use of the data The Behemoth collects, including the public display of information such as your user ID, your user created content or any other gameplay data. The Behemoth may also use such information for statistical purposes, the public display of user statistics and/or game rankings, to improve your game play experience, to provide you with advertisements or information that might be of interest to you, and any other reasonable purpose, at The Behemoth's sole discretion.
<br><br>
<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.</u></b></font>
<br><br>
There may be tracking technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site and Service.  Further, third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Site and Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.  We may not control those tracking technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you understand that when you use our Service you may potentially encounter third party tracking technologies in connection with use of the Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the tracking technologies or practices of such third parties.  For more information on our vendors, and their Tracking Technologies see the chart at the end of this policy.    
<br><br>
Your browser or other third party mechanisms may be able to allow you to signal or otherwise express your choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals).  Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these 'do not track' signals or other mechanisms.  
<br><br>
<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>How to Change your information and communications preferences:</u></b></font>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<font style="color:black; margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b><u>Security:</u></b></font>
<br><br>
The Behemoth intends to use commercially reasonable means to protect the integrity of its Site and Service, and the confidentiality of the personal information that you provide.
