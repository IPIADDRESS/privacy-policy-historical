					<strong>Transactional and Site Activity Information.</strong> When

					hardware information. If you access <span class="xfactor">THE X
						FACTOR</span> Services from a mobile or other device, we may
					collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other
					transactional information for that device in order to serve content
					to it. We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies
					(such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash
					technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often
					include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to
					your browser when you first request a web page and then store the
					data on your computer so the website can access information when
					you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These
					technologies may be used to collect and store information about
					your usage of <span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span> Services,
					such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and
					advertisements you have seen. <span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
					may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of <span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span> Services to personal
					information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For
					example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our
					upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data
					about your activities on <span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
					Website may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items
					we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online
					activities and preferences.

					Third parties that support <span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
					Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as
					providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing
					users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics
					may also use these technologies to collect similar information. <span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span> does not control these third
					party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy
					policies of these third parties using such technologies. For more
					information about third party ad networks that use these
					technologies, see www.aboutads.info.
