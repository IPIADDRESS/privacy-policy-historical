</p>
<p><em>User Submitted Information</em></p>
<p>
<strong>Registration Information</strong> is the information that users must provide to

<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, such as a username and/or user picture.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Public Information and Posts</strong> will always be public which means it will be available to everyone and will be displayed in search results both on
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services and on external search engines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Information and Content.</strong>  If you access a
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Service through a third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that third party service, any information/content you have permitted the third party to share with

</p>
<p>
<em>
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Collected Information
</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transactional and Site Activity Information.</strong>  When users access
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.  We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier.  Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site.  These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen.
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Website may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
</p>
<p>
Third parties that support
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
<span class="xfactor">THE X FACTOR</span>
does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info.
