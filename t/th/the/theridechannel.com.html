<p><strong>California &amp; Canadian Users: Your California Privacy Rights.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personally identifiable information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy explain our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct or indirect marketing purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, if you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may contact us at <a href="http://legal@complex.com">legal@complex.com</a>. &nbsp;</span>Canadian residents also have certain rights to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, these opt-out options are available for all users and are not limited to Californian and Canadian users.</p>
