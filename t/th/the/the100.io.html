<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Pwntastic collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Pwntastic’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Pwntastic’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Pwntastic may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Pwntastic also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Pwntastic only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Pwntastic’s websites choose to interact with Pwntastic in ways that require Pwntastic to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pwntastic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  In each case, Pwntastic collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Pwntastic. Pwntastic does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Pwntastic may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.  Pwntastic may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pwntastic does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Pwntastic publicly displays your profile information so that other players can find you. This includes your Gamer ID, age, and any other info you choose to enter, except we never publicly display your email, phone number, or address.</p>
<p>Pwntastic discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Pwntastic’s behalf or to provide services available at Pwntastic’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Pwntastic’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Pwntastic will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Pwntastic discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Pwntastic believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Pwntastic, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Pwntastic website and have supplied your email address, Pwntastic may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Pwntastic and our products.  If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Pwntastic takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pwntastic uses cookies to help Pwntastic identify and track visitors, their usage of Pwntastic website, and their website access preferences. Pwntastic visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Pwntastic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Pwntastic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Pwntastic, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pwntastic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pwntastic may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Pwntastic and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
