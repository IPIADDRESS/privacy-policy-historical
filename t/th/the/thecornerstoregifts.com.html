My wife wasn't ovulating. Her eggs, though healthy, wouldn't pop out of the ovary and into the fallopian tube for fertilization. My sperm, for that matter, couldn't fertilize anything even if they found an egg. Sperm needs to be plentiful, and a specific shape. Great numbers, because so many don't make the the entire journey to the egg. Pointed heads, because they need to pierce that egg in order to create an embryo. My swimmers had flat heads. They could bump up against an egg all they wanted, but had no way to enter.  (Personally, I'm not so sure about the &quot;couldn't&quot; part, and think maybe it was a &quot;wouldn't.&quot; I'd like to think my sperm had my back. &quot;Kids? Kids that throw up in your bed at 5am and poop out of their diapers and are booger-factories? Yeah... we're good without that. We'll hang here outside the egg.&quot;)  After rounds of medicated cycles, timed ovulation shots, and intrauterine insemination--the turkey baster method--it was time for IVF: in vitro fertilization.  Our hospital was able to harvest twenty eggs, and fertilize eleven thanks to a process that used a needle to place my sperm directly into the egg for nestling.&nbsp;My wife and I were exceedingly lucky; three transfers became two babies. There are horror stories of couples attempting cycle after cycle and going tens of thousands of dollars into debt, and we were fortunate to avoid that scenario. My wife has rock solid insurance, and we only had one transfer, our first, fail. After that we were given a daughter, and the very first attempt for our second child provided a son.  During the process, we inserted one embryo at a time, because neither of us were interested in Octo-momming our way to a Brady Bunch from the starting gate. Since the math on IVF is never one-to-one--some embryos don't survive the thaw, others don't mature properly--we had three healthy embryos remaining. Three embryos, in deep freeze, waiting.  But waiting... for what?  Our options were: Throw them away. Some people equate the disposal of embryos to abortion, but I cannot go down that path. Abortion is such a heated, personal topic that I don't want to broach it, but I do not see any parity between disposing of frozen cells and the termination of life. It's way too broad. I see waste. To destroy cells when they could be used for good is pathetic. Wasting them wasn't an option. But it's not murder. Continue to store them. Our family was complete; two kiddos was the plan, so storage seemed like an unnecessary financial burden. Our fee would have been $300 a year, but many places charge upwards of $1,000 annually. Donate them to stem cell research. This was a decision to be made carefully. On the one hand, donation to research could do a lot of good for humanity. On the other, it would anger knee-jerk, blinder-driven people who believe a clump of cells invisible to the naked eye is &quot;life.&quot; So... win-win, I guess. Due to these two factors, this was almost the path we took. Donation to a couple even more infertile than we were. Once we discovered this path, there was no looking back.  Though my wife and I couldn't get naked and make babies, we still had the ability to create children with our genes. There are couples out there for whom biological babies aren't an option. With embryo donation, we could give our baby starter kits to a couple, allowing them to create the family they longed for. We would be granting hope to people bereft of it.  My wife and I didn't donate to be generous, and we didn't do it for good karma. We did it because it was the right thing to do. We had the ability to help someone, so we did. End of story. Knowing how difficult our meager struggle was, we could only imagine how painful it would be for someone in a worse predicament.  If the decision to donate was step one, picking a home for our embryos was step two. That was was a doozie.  We wanted to take part in &quot;known adoption,&quot; not just throw our embryos to the wind. For my wife, she didn't want to live with the wonder: did my embryos create life? Will I pass my biological child in the grocery store someday and not know it? With me, I worried about my child losing the Alabama-lottery. I didn't want either of my kids to wander into a bar in twenty-some years, meet someone they were instantly attracted to without knowing why, and... well, you get the drift. A one in a million possibility, but hey, I want to protect my kiddos as much as absolutely possible.  My wife and I were put in touch with a small agency designed to match donors to recipients. A boutique agency, if you will, as opposed to &quot;Donating Embryos Inc.&quot; I was surprised to discover that matching embryo donors and recipients can be quite the little niche business. There's profit aplenty to be had off desperate people, which I find repulsive. I understand a finder's fee; I'm not so keen on meeting sales goals. My wife and I wanted something small and personal; nothing &quot;corporate.&quot;  Once signed up with the matchmaker, a new wrinkle appeared in the process. People are judgmental creatures; studies show we make snap decisions about others in the blink of an eye. We judge by appearance, speech patterns, hair color, eye color, skin color... anything and everything we can. I didn't realize how quickly (and possibly unfairly) my wife and I dismissed possible recipients. To put it bluntly: I'd swear the first list of offerings we saw was straight from the &quot;People of Wal Mart&quot; website.  Am I horrible for saying that?  Yes.  Am I going to hide it and pretend to be a better person than I am?  No.  Replace donation with online dating; Tinder is based on swiping left or right on a snap judgment. That's what this felt like: Tinder for Parenting. For every &quot;maybe,&quot; there were a handful of immediate &quot;NO&quot; reactions. And the &quot;maybe&quot; was never strong, it was just &quot;well, in comparison to...&quot;  Some were easy. There were the couples who had children from respective former marriages, but wanted to have their own kids together. To us, someone trying for their first baby took precedent over someone that already had children to love. There were the couples, and again forgive the honesty, who were recently married and looking to start their families in their late 40s and early 50s. Was it ageist of us to pass them over? Yes. Did we do it anyway? Yes.  We felt ugly; judging others is never a positive feeling.  Going back to my &quot;People of Wal Mart&quot; analogy: when you look at that site, you have an innocent chuckle because someone is dressed inappropriately, or has crazy hair. But when you see someone on an &quot;I need an embryo to start my family&quot; website, you know there is love, hope, and longing behind the inappropriate clothes and crazy hair.  Fortunately, my wife's therapist came to our rescue. She put into words what we could not: we wanted someone like us. Not too young--&quot;I'm 19 and want to start a family!&quot;--not too old (&quot;55 and infertile&quot; may make for a great headline on &quot;CougarsOnly-dot-com,&quot; but not on a fertility website), loving, and progressive. If your bio read: &quot;We're a loving heterosexual couple, just like the bible wants!&quot; you could expect to be passed over.  (We were not offered any same-sex couples, but that could have been the direction we went had one arose.)  Eventually, we settled on a nice, middle-class, Midwestern couple. The wives clicked immediately in areas only women click in, and the husband and I clicked in our male disinterest in conversation and all things touchy-feely. They're such nice people, we even forgave them for being Vikings fans.  (It could be worse; they could like the Bears.)  This &quot;connection of the couples&quot; first took place one year ago, in November, 2014. It was followed by months of medical exams, psychological exams, lawyer-reviewed contracts, medical testing, and money-raising. Our recipients, sadly, do not have the same rock star insurance my wife does. Fortunately, we chose them for their personalities, not their bank accounts.  All in all, our embryos seem to have found a good home.  Here's to hoping that home soon houses a family.  more nonsense at www.nathantimmel.com -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

They have their own personalities and passions, and I find their different perspectives fascinating, especially when they differ from my own. I like what clinical psychologist Shefali Tsabary says, &quot;when you parent, it's crucial you realize you aren't raising a 'mini me,' but a spirit throbbing with its own signature.&quot;   I'm not raising robots who simply do what I tell them to do. I want them to think for themselves and share their thoughts about the world with me. This is the template for how they will communicate with others long after they leave my house, and I want them to be able to stand their ground.  While negotiating well is a wonderful technique that we praise in adults, we vilify it in our children. Presenting a cogent argument for something is &quot;talking back&quot; in some homes, so kids never get to really build the muscle to think critically and express it in a safe way.   My husband and I allow this type of back-and-forth conversation in our house. But, admittedly, my patience for my kids' well-thought out arguments runs out when it comes to certain topics, such as screen-time. I have crafty kids who regularly present very logical cases for more screen-time.   They're making good grades. They've only had 30 minutes today. They need to check homework. They want to play an educational game.  All of these arguments may, in fact, be true. Kids are masters at making a solid case for more screen time. But there's a point when all that back and forth is exhausting. Even the most empathic parent reaches a tipping point. I've certainly reached mine, which resulted in an airborne iPad out the back door.   This video is literally taken from a page in my own parenting playbook.    When the negotiating starts in our house, I'm using a crafty technique myself. One I learned from my kids' preschool days. It's short, effective, and as necessary at age 13 as it was at age 3.  When I was getting my degree in Counseling Psychology (and my kids were very little), I was introduced to the work of John Gottman, a pioneer in marriage and family counseling. Some of his most compelling research examines how marriages affect kids and kids affect marriages.  The valuable insight I gleaned from Gottman's work is the power of Emotion Coaching, which is a method parents can use to help children develop emotional intelligence while solving problems.   For example, when my son was 3-years-old, he had a full blown meltdown at playgroup. When I used the techniques of Emotion Coaching, he settled down. He could listen because he felt listened to. I could redirect him. And it took under five minutes. IT WORKED!   And it was then that I learned the power of one little word to help me do that. That word?   Nonetheless.   Here's how it played out: &quot;I can tell you're really frustrated that you can't play with that car right now, nonetheless, I'm not going to let you hurt yourself or someone else because you're mad right now.&quot;  Now, 10 years later, I'm still using that word. And no time has that word been more critical or effective than in negotiating screen time.  &quot;I get it. You feel like you deserve more time online. It's your playground. You're having fun on those screens and get to do cool things. Nonetheless, you've hit your limit. Your eyes and brain need a break. It's time to engage with something or someone else.&quot;   Parenting is a blend of empathy and setting limits.   &quot;I understand that you want to play Minecraft for 16 hours, but that's not gonna happen. I know you want honey buns for dinner, but yeah, no. There's a limit to my goodness.&quot;  As my kids have gotten older and our conversations have deepened, more than ever I want to listen to them and empathize with what they're thinking and feeling. That's what good parents try to do.   Nonetheless.  I will continue to set limits-- with screens and everything else -- that reflect our values. Limits that call my kids back to their humanity, back to balance, back to their childhood, even when they don't agree.   Because that's what good parents try to do.

They are often talented, creative, persistent at their tasks, and very good at what they do.   You may know a child who works on Legos for hours, following every instruction in the booklet, and then creating his own displays of vehicles, architectural feats, new settings with figures. He may or not be a good reader, but he can follow visual instructions with pictures to a tee and then generalize to making his own creations.  You may know an artist who from a young age can draw perspective, make portraits of people, create landscapes and still lifes in various media. They may take lessons or just create on their own. They work endlessly and happily enjoying their various well-developed creations. All these hours of work lead to increasing their skills well beyond their age level.  This is a girl or boy of any age who &quot;zones in&quot; effectively. They may be a bit irritable when you interrupt them because they are so passionate and intense on their project, but they tend to be polite and explain, &quot;I'm just concentrating.&quot; If their parents prize these abilities and accept their child's hard working style, there is little conflict. These kids are very capable of interrupting themselves when they are needed to join in with family activities, but they may be a bit slow in leaving their work to comply. Once this is understood by all, there need be no arguments.  These kids are usually good students giving the same concentration to the subjects that interest them. They may not like rote assignments because they are creative and like to understand what they're doing, not just repeat what they've been told to memorize. But generally speaking, they get good grades, need little prompting to get work done, and are intelligent and persevering. They don't mind hard work because they revel in it. Who knows how they'll add to society as they grow older!  Kids Who &quot;Zone Out&quot;  This is a different kind of kid. This child or teen gets mesmerized by action videos and TV. They can watch these shows for hours tied to the screen. They tend to use the screen shows to avoid and procrastinate when they have work to do. It's hard to get them to stop. In fact, this intense watching may relax them if their anxiety is high.   They may not be willing to share the video with others, although they may also watch in groups, each viewer as involved as the next. In fact, these viewers may seek each other out because they share this common interest. They can get testy when a parent tries to turn it off to have them focus on other things like homework, chores, or coming to dinner.  This child or teen is generally not being creative. They watch the same shows over and over and if they are playing a game, they may increase their skills at, for example, shooting down an enemy. The shows don't usually encourage higher level thinking, but focus on good and bad, winner and loser, heroes and enemies, bullies and victims. This is &quot;black and white&quot; thinking. It is uncomplicated and the directions are learned in a rote way.  If this &quot;zoning out&quot; becomes problematic because it creates arguments and conflicts with others who might want to use the screen to watch something else, or they have other priorities to attend to that they avoid, then parents need to draw the child's attention to what is happening.   Here are a few tips: 1. Tell your child he is ignoring others and hurting their feelings. You want him or her to think of others. 2. Help them prioritize the other tasks they need to do like homework, chores, visiting with friends and family before they get hooked on a show. 3. Share with them how the themes of the shows tend to be the same: they focus on good and bad guys. This raises their awareness. Let them know that people are more complicated than that and you don't want them stuck in that way of thinking because it's limiting their ways of viewing human beings  If you have experiences with kids who &quot;zone in&quot; or &quot;zone out&quot; please leave comments here so we can discuss this as parents.

I'm packing the bags (enough underwear for the 5-year old? Check).   And a special sort of holiday anxiety creeps in.  Will uncle Mike make crude jokes? Are my kids going to freak out with all the sugar and changes in schedule? Is mom going to get all crazed about the turkey?   We could say the holidays bring their own special joys and challenges.  We could also say that they tax our parental sanity!  Life with kids can be stressful enough.   Add on the dynamics of the extended family and the pressure to get everything just so (ahem... parties, shopping, baking, cleaning, and entertaining), and it can be a breeding ground for stress.  Imagine instead that you kept your cool and rolled with the punches this season. Without the anxiety, how would your experience be?  Instead of crazed, we could be calm.

Prevent Holiday Stress  When stress is at it's peak, it's hard to stop and regroup. Instead, let's prevent holiday stress before it starts.   There's a practical, research-proven strategy that leads to less stress, improved mood, clearer thinking, more physical energy, and more equanimity.   What's this secret weapon?  Mindfulness.  I think of mindfulness meditation as this awesome brain hack that all parents need.   It's so simple (but not easy), do-able (it doesn't have to be 20 minutes, folks!), and voila! We build a reserve of calm and peace that's priceless.  How does it work?   The mechanics are very simple. Sit still and pay attention to your breathing. Soon your mind will wander. When you notice that, you bring your attention back and notice your breathing again.   Over time, instead of being inside your thinking, you realize that you are separate from your thinking. You can be objective and choose different thoughts.   And since our thoughts trigger our emotions, we can slow down that cycle. It leads to more equanimity.  I lead a free virtual mindfulness retreat to help people begin a practice of their own. One participant said, &quot;I can feel a separation between my anxious thoughts and me. I feel more grounded.&quot;  Another said, &quot;I feel more peaceful, loving, kind.&quot;  Isn't THAT how we want to feel this holiday season?  This year, head of the stress before it starts. Have a game plan.   Use the tools of mindfulness to cultivate your inner zen master.   Learn more about my free mindfulness retreat. Start the habit that will lead to greater peace, happiness, and more connected, present parenting over the long run. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

After an action-packed morning filled with Halloween+dinosaur+train adventures (I, too, was surprised there was such a one-stop-shop, and somewhat annoyed I didn't know about it until now), our two precious boys took all of two minutes in their car seats before dozing off. The plan was for my husband to drop me off in the village so I could get a manicure, as he would continue driving until the boys woke up, and then we would all regroup at home for dinner. As we slowed to a near halt (because God forbid we actually stop the car which is apparently like a blaring megaphone to young sleeping children), I ever so quietly slither out for my half hour of bliss, not looking behind me as I leave.   I pick out my color (&quot;Miss Fancy Pants,&quot; for those who are curious), sit down at my designated station, and look around as the nail technician behind the desk begins filing. I close my eyes (partially because I start to relax and partially because my 1 year old truly doesn't understand the gift that is the Daylight Savings extra hour). That is, until I hear a woman, probably in her 50s, enter the salon. Something told me to look up. And just like that, I saw my entire life flash before me.   I saw a woman going to get her nails done, which was probably her weekly routine, not because she needed a break, but because she wanted to fill her day. Her kids were all grown up and moved out. She wasn't looking for quiet -- she was escaping it. She once stood in my shoes, many years ago, up to her ears in diapers and toy trucks, and then before she knew it, her babies were no longer babies. And I literally teared up, overcome with emotion, and suddenly, desperately, longed to get home.   It happened almost instantly, but with the birth of these boys, my life became theirs. Everything we do is for them, about them, because of them.   I guess I take for granted the fact that I am so rarely alone. With either one or both boys, there is constant talking, singing, questioning, and laughing. Things that most people do by themselves, I have an audience. For 95% of my life I believed going to the bathroom was a solitary action. Not so. As I quickly attempt to finish my business, my older son hugs me while telling me I'm doing a great job and my younger son is literally climbing up the side of the toilet and somehow figures out how to put his hand on the seat. While I'm still sitting on it. Running to Duane Reade used to take 5 minutes tops as I would breeze in and out, yet it is now a 45 minute excursion, cart and all, even if we are just picking up tissues. And driving was once a peaceful quiet time, but instead it's now all Laurie Berkner Band all the time.   So often my husband and I have been told how quickly time goes by. That concept was always hard for me to grasp. As a kid, time was of no consequence. Which is probably how my boys feel now. As my older one tells me, &quot;I had to wait sooooooo long before the alarm clock turned green.&quot; (Perhaps 10 minutes?) But, with this new parental perspective, I really understand what the old lady at the diner means. Because, while each day can seem like an eternity, the years slip by like quicksand.  I know one day these boys will not need me in the same capacity that they do now. I know (someday soon) it won't be acceptable for me to give them a million kisses an hour or pull them on my lap for a big bear hug. And &quot;mommy&quot; will soon turn to &quot;mom&quot; which makes my heart break a little.  This crazy, chaotic togetherness that, I'll admit, I do need a half hour break from every Sunday afternoon, is what I live for. And I'm sure it will evolve and get even better. But for now, it's important for me to remember to savor these long days for they will be gone all too soon. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

When her boyfriend Justin Coats was planning to pop the question on September 25,&nbsp;he made sure to include her students -- past and present -- in the proposal.  &quot;I knew I wanted to propose at her school, some way, somehow and let the kids be a part of it all,&quot; Justin told The Huffington Post. &quot;That's what means more than anything to her -- her kids.&quot; (Story continues after video)    It took three months for Justin to orchestrate the proposal. First he emailed all of their family and friends, asking them to record a short video telling Mandy to &quot;say yes!&quot;&nbsp;  He also called the principal at South Boston Elementary School, where his now-fiancée works, to tell him about the proposal. The plan was to compile the clips from their family and friends and surprise Mandy with the video at school.&nbsp;  On that special day in September, the principal called Mandy into his office, allowing Justin enough time to set up everything in the classroom and leave before she came back in. When she returned,&nbsp;she and all 42 of her students -- her morning class and her afternoon class -- watched the sweet proposal video together.&nbsp;  Mandy was shocked.&nbsp;That's when Justin and three of her former students walked into the room holding a banner that read,&nbsp;&quot;Miss Toombs, will you be Mrs. Coats?&quot; The answer -- of course -- was &quot;yes!&quot;  &quot;Although all my students are very special to me, these three boys hold a very special place in my heart,&quot; Mandy told HuffPost. &quot;They come to my class each morning to say 'hello', tell me 'bye' before they leave school. Justin and I go to their football games and they come to me with any problems or anything that is bothering them.&nbsp;To have Justin make those three boys a part of my big day, it put the icing on the cake.&quot; &nbsp; Mandy also told HuffPost that her fourth graders were beyond excited to be a part of it all.&nbsp; &quot;Some were crying, others were jumping with joy,&quot; she said. &quot;To this day, the students talk about it. They even ask me every week, 'can we watch the video again?'&quot;&nbsp; After the proposal, Mandy received many emails from parents thanking her for allowing their kids to be involved.&nbsp;  The happy couple first met in July 2012 --&nbsp;Coats was DJing at a bar in&nbsp;Semora,&nbsp;North Carolina one night and Mandy was there as the designated driver for a group of her friends. Although Mandy said she &quot;wasn't looking for anyone&quot; at the time, the pair hit it off and went out on their first date the following night.&nbsp; To see Justin and Mandy's A+ proposal unfold, watch the video above.&nbsp; H/T ABC News Also on HuffPost:&nbsp; -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
