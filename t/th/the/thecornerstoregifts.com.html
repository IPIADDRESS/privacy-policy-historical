Families with children have driven neighborhood segregation since the 1990s, according to a new study from University of Southern California professor Ann Owens. While families without children -- both high- and low-income -- continue to live in diverse areas, families with children have been sequestering themselves to the neighborhoods with the best local schools.&nbsp; As income inequality has gotten worse -- and especially affected families with children -- &nbsp;so too has this phenomenon. This is bad news for low-income families that have kids. When affluent families choose housing based on local school options, those without the ability to choose are left with the worst schools.&nbsp; Since 1990, &quot;the increase in residential income segregation occurred entirely among families with children, for whom income segregation rose by about 20 percent,&quot; wrote Owens, an assistant professor in the department of sociology. For families with no children, residential income segregation remained fairly stagnant.&nbsp;&quot;By 2010, income segregation between neighborhoods among families with children was twice as high as segregation among childless households,&quot; said the study. The story of rising residential segregation, according to Owens, is a story&nbsp;&quot;about families with children,&quot; and the schools that they choose. Owens, who looked at census data from 100 major U.S. metropolitan areas, was surprised by the results.&nbsp; &quot;I didn’t expect that neighborhood segregation really hasn’t changed at all among childless households, I didn’t expect that at all,&quot; Owens told The Huffington Post. &quot;Neighborhood segregation is increasing solely because of families with kids.&quot; Owens cites a few reasons why this might be happening. In addition to rising rates of income inequality in the country, she notes an increase in the &quot;intensification of parenting,&quot; although Owens did not directly measure the impact of this factor.&nbsp; &quot;Parents are trying to give their kids the best advantage possible,&quot; Owens said. &quot;Parents are spending more money on their kids than they used to. The gap in spending is so high-income families increasingly outspend low-income families.&quot; The study raises questions about how neighborhood income segregation is affecting school segregation. Indeed, schools have become more racially segregated over the past several decades.&nbsp;This can have a devastating impact on children.&nbsp;Schools with a higher concentration of students of color tend to have fewer material resources and less experienced teachers.&nbsp; Owens also fears that this increasing residential segregation will only perpetuate inequality. &quot;I think there's serious implications for future inequality and intergenerational mobility,&quot; said Owens. &quot;We know both neighborhoods and schools are really important contexts for kids' development. If poor kids are growing up in contexts of concentrated poverty, we know that has a negative impact on their future outcomes.&quot; So what can be done to fix the rising neighborhood separation between affluent families with children and everyone else?&nbsp; Possible remedies include policies that create more affordable housing in high-income and mixed-income areas, as well as interventions that &quot;break the link between neighborhoods and schools and create more equal schooling opportunities for everyone,&quot; Owens said.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;______ Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

The whole holiday has, somehow, left me feeling unappreciated. I've tended to get in a funk, and not out of grief or some sort of well-defined pain--I can only imagine how hard Mother's Day must be to someone who has lost their mother. I feel bad in a bratty way, like a toddler who is pissed that she's not getting what she wants. The worst version of myself has typically made her appearance, ironically, on the day that we were supposed to be celebrating my best, most beloved, self.    What is it that has left me so resentful on Mother's Day? What have I wanted so much that I haven't been getting?  Until about an hour ago, I thought it was about gratitude. I wanted to be appreciated on Mother's Day in the way that we used to show appreciation to my mother. Research shows that when we express gratitude in our relationships, we become more attuned to our family member's efforts on our behalf. I was hoping for a little more attunement to all the work I do as a mom--mostly from my husband, but also the kids.  At least the way I remember it (I'm a little afraid to ask my mom for verification; it just now occurred to me that my memory is probably a little rosy), we'd bring my mom breakfast in bed, showering her with homemade cards and gifts. My dad would give my mom a funny card and a gift that he'd bought. We'd take a family bike ride on the path around St. Mary's College, with a picnic that my dad and I packed with help from the deli at Black's Market. Norman Rockwell could've painted us.  None of that actually seems hard to recreate, but for the love of God my family has never even come close. Last year I laid out my expectations clearly for my husband. &quot;I'm fine with no gifts,&quot; I explained, &quot;So long as there are cards and a family activity.&quot; This did not happen. With four active teenagers and a husband who refuses to plan anything more than a day in advance, our only family outings are planned by me.  For the record, three of the four children made me BEAUTIFUL, heartfelt Mother's Day cards. Kelly-Corrigan-level cards. They were practically set to music they were so thoughtful and moving. But that was not enough for me.  Expectations are a tricky thing. Unfulfilled, they set us up to ruin what is actually happening by ruminating over what we think ought to be happening. Painful thoughts--How could he not do this for me given all I do for this family??! Does he not appreciate me at all?--start to loop endlessly, triggering waves of disappointment.  So how could I make this year different? I already lowered my expectations to no material gifts, and that didn't help me much; I'm not sure I can lower them to nothing. In past years, I've made a massive effort to focus on myself less by helping others, but ultimately, even that didn't really prevent me from feeling unappreciated myself. I felt entitled to a little gratitude, damnit.  (Let's not miss the irony here: Entitlement is pretty much the opposite of gratitude. Rarely do we attract the opposite of what we feel. Just as we don't foster other people's love by lashing out at them, my unbridled sense of entitlement wasn't exactly generating a mountain of appreciation.)  Emotional traps like this--obsessing over my feelings of unmet expectations--are usually triggered by a mistaken belief. So where was the error in my thinking?  I really was feeling unappreciated by Mark, my husband. I felt like I sacrificed more for our family and children, and that he should recognize and feel grateful for that. I held a deep-seated conviction that I gave more. I spent more time doing the hardest parenting work, creating and enforcing structure and discipline, managing the near-constant drama of life with three teenage girls and an active adolescent boy.  Now, I should mention that, according to research, I am not alone in believing that I do more for our family than my husband--but I might not be correct. When researchers add up the percent of work each person in a couple says he or she does, they consistently find that the total ends up being more than 100 percent. So if a mom says she does 65 percent of the household work, and her husband says he contributes a solid 50 percent . . . there is a 15 percent error in there somewhere. Perhaps this was the heart of my mistaken belief?  My Mother's Day funk did grow out of my belief that I do and sacrifice more for our family than Mark does. And weirdly, I somehow thought that this seemingly massive imbalance could be righted through a Mother's Day display of profound appreciation.  This is funny to me now, because clearly even the most magical Mother's Day outing would not dissolve my resentment. We needed to deal with the source of my resentment.  &quot;We need counseling,&quot; I announced to Mark. I sat down to work through what I wanted help resolving. What did I want Mark to do differently?  What I found, when I really thought hard about it, was that my assumptions about our division of labor were blatantly untrue. Believe me, I was shocked by this revelation. But it turned out that I had loads of evidence suggesting I don't do more for our family than Mark.  True, I do the bulk of the emotional labor. But he does nearly all the house and garden maintenance. We spend about the same amount of time in the car driving kids around. I plan our meals and cook; he shops and cleans up. We've got a division of labor where he does the things he likes to do best (like mowing the lawn) while I get to do the things that I love to do (like talking to the kids about their feelings). I am lucky to have a truly equal partnership.  I was harboring resentment out of habit rather than reality. At times, being a mother can feel so overwhelming; when the kids were little, I sometimes felt a little victimized by it all, a little trapped by the sheer magnitude of the way they'd taken over my life. My husband simply couldn't do many of the things that I was doing. Pregnancy, labor and delivery, and breastfeeding bred loads of occasions when only mama would do. My family could never repay me for the sacrifices I'd made for them--but they could, and should, show me a little gratitude for it. Hence my feelings of entitlement to a little Mother's Day appreciation.  Billy Collins wrote a poem about this. In it, Collins recounts the thousands of meals his mom made him, and the good education she provided, and all the other zillions of things she did for him. In return he gave her . . . a lanyard he made at camp. Collins concludes:  And here, I wish to say to her now, is a smaller gift--not the worn truth that you can never repay your mother, but the rueful admission that when she took  the two-tone lanyard from my hand,  I was as sure as a boy could be that this useless, worthless thing I wove  out of boredom would be enough to make us even.   Now, this is what I wish to tell my children and husband both: We are even, with or without lanyards and family outings on Mother's Day.  Because I am not trapped. I have not been victimized. There is no need for reparation. You don't owe me a darn thing, even gratitude. I don't have to do any of the many things I do for you or our family. I choose to do them. I do them because I love each of you so very much. Moreover, this love that I feel for you is the greatest gift I've ever been given. It is a great joy to be a mother in this family, your family. I'm deeply, profoundly grateful for all we are and all we have--together. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

In it, The small Sith Lord does everyday tasks in a way that's just sinisterly adorable.&nbsp; The project, called &quot;Little Lord Vader,&quot; was shared on Tumblr just ahead of Wednesday's &quot;Star Wars Day.&quot;&nbsp;  The small Darth Vader is seen doing anything from munching on a burger to changing diapers (probably with the use of The Force). The photos were shot over a few months, and Hopkirk told the Huffington Post that the 4-year-old was actually behind the concepts for some of the shots.&nbsp; &quot;Harry had lots of ideas,&quot; the London-based photographer said.&nbsp;&quot;And he insisted that we include his little brother Ted in the pictures.&quot;&nbsp;  Hopkirk told HuffPost in an e-mail that his son's love of Star Wars began just before the release of &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; last year. It didn't take much for the tot to get hooked. &quot;I decided that, even though he's quite young, I couldn't deny Harry the chance to see a brand new 'Star Wars' movie on the big screen, so I had to quickly show him all the other films first,&quot; he explained. &quot;He was just completely in awe of them. I'm a massive fan myself, but I didn't need to do any selling -- he fell in love with them straight away.&quot;  Interestingly enough, Harry gravitated toward the notorious Sith Lord the most.&nbsp; &quot;He loves all the characters, but for some reason he went nuts over Darth Vader -- to be fair, he is pretty awesome. When we play together he always wants the Dark Side the triumph. Hopefully that's not a reason to be concerned,&quot; Hopkirk joked.&nbsp;  After the dad bought his son a Darth Vader costume, he realized just how kickass Harry looked. Pretty soon, a photo series was born. So far, there are 15 photos in the series, but Hopkirk isn't done capturing the cutest villain in the galaxy yet and promises there's more to come.&nbsp; To see more of Little Lord Vader and his antics, head on over to Hopkirk's Tumblr page for the project here.&nbsp; -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Want to share your experience of divorcing at a certain age? Email us at&nbsp;divorce@huffingtonpost.com. At 25, teacher and writer Rachel Scott found herself newly divorced and raising two young children on her own. It was hardly the life she had envisioned but eventually, she realized it was a mistake to dwell on how she got there. &quot;In your 20s, I think it's easy to miss the truth that life hasn’t ended just because a marriage did,&quot; she said.&nbsp; Below, Rachel, who has been married to second husband Willie since 2011 (together they have a total of seven kids!)&nbsp;tells The Huffington Post more of her story.  Being divorced in your 20s can give you life or break you. I had been married for a total of four years when my husband and I split up. I was a mother of two young kids. There were times I found myself completely embarrassed to say that at 25, I had already experienced divorce. It felt like admitting youth had lead me down a road of destruction and I was left living with the consequences.&nbsp; At that age, you're still learning how to surround yourself with people who are life giving rather than life taking. That was the case for me, at least. I was still trying to find healthy relationships in my life and learning that those that weren’t healthy for me had to go. No matter how much you may want something or someone around, if it isn’t bringing life to you, it's taking life from you.    How people respond to the news depends a lot on the character and heart of the people in your inner circle. My family and friends were very supportive and understood why divorce was my only option. They were full of wisdom and truth which helped me avoid completely emotional decisions and responses.&nbsp; Still, other people who had not been an active part of my life through the marriage had a lot to say.&nbsp;I learned to value the opinions of those who actually knew what was going on and had my best interest at heart.    The truth is, no one gets married planning their divorce. It comes as an unpleasant shock to everyone to realize that hearts once united can so easily grow divided. But in fairness to the life that you have yet to live, allow yourself to grow through this disappointment. Become wiser for your future. It may be the end of your world as you know it but it's not the end of the world. With your past mistakes behind you and greater wisdom and perspective to guide you, you are on the right path to a brighter future. Heed the wisdom gained from your past.  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

That Sunday in May where a lot of us will be planning something special for the mothers in our lives.  For the most part, we will try to give thanks to mothers for their love, encouragement, blood, sweat, and tears spent raising us in this world.  Some of us will cry on this day over the mothers we have lost -- or cast our eyes downward in disappointment over the mothers we never knew.  Hopefully more than not will be able to call, send a card, or see their mothers in person.   There also exists a certain group of women out there who may find this day awkward, disappointing, or even painful.  Stepmoms.  Being a stepmom myself, I know this feeling. It never really goes away completely. But it can get better. Whether you're more of a full-time stepmom, an every other weekend stepmom -- with your own biological children or not -- Mother's Day can feel like a poignant slap in the face.  Although there is now a &quot;Stepmother's day&quot; on the Sunday following Mother's Day, it's not exactly widely known or accepted in the same way that Mother's Day is.   But just to let all of you brave stepmoms out there know --  this is okay.  It's okay that you don't have an &quot;official&quot; day where everyone has to stop and intentionally recognize you. You're still amazing. You're still worthy, and you still have guts of steel for continuing on your step-mothering journey.   Some of us stepmoms are fortunate enough to have stepchildren who do make us cards or something special to pay tribute to our efforts.   And... some of us don't.   Obviously, I think we should appreciate all parents, grandparents, guardians, teachers, and people in our lives who help raise our children on a daily basis. But -- traditionally -- in our culture, there are those very popular days assigned to special people and Mother's Day happens to be one of them.   As a stepmom, this doesn't necessarily need to be a day to feel bitter or depressed.  It's normal to feel resentful about not getting recognized on Mother's Day when you may do a lot of the grunt work in raising your stepchild or stepchildren. It's okay to feel that. You're human.   But it's also okay to then let it go.   Whether your stepchild or stepchildren's mother is a huge presence in their lives or a more distant one -- she is still their mother. Whether you like her or not -- she is still their mother. Whether you agree with her way of parenting or not -- she is still their mother.   Learning to allow your stepchild or stepchildren's biological mother to get her credit on Mother's Day is not an acceptance of defeat and it doesn't mean you won't ever be appreciated yourself. Don't give up, and remember on this Mother's Day the important work you are doing.  Being a stepmom is a relationship like no other. Even the seemingly impossible challenges and fights will bond you to your stepchild or stepchildren for a lifetime. Your role is more imperative than you may realize. The lessons you can teach, the love you can give, the laughter you can make -- are all yours.   There are lessons you will learn about yourself over time being a stepmom. These may be lessons you would never have learned otherwise. They are gifts.   As a stepmom, you still have the power to help create a child or children that grow into productive, caring, wonderful human beings. You are a teacher, a protector, and a guide. Your impact can be powerful. Mother's Day does not detract from that.   You are phenomenal. You are courageous. And you are playing a role that not everyone can.   So maybe you don't get a stepmom Oscar -- or even get nominated. But you are in the role of a lifetime and it can reap some rewarding benefits. It may not be this Sunday, or even the Sunday after that -- but one day you will know that all your hard work, tears, love, and determination have made a difference in someone's life. And in your own.   This Sunday treat yourself like the queen you already are -- and stay resilient.
