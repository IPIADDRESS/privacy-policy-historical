But where does this sort of racism come from?  I don't know that I have the answer, but I do have a particular, firsthand experience that may give some insight into the question. Because, I know exactly when racism, as a concept, began for me: during dinner at home on a bright, fall day in September, 1970.  I was introduced to the awfulness of the concept and its racialized words and their effect at our family dinner table.  I was adopted when I was six years old. I was the mixed-race product of an uneducated, starving Korean prostitute and an unknown American GI. I had been adopted by a Swedish American family in rural Minnesota who had a son and three daughters of their own.  My parents were pleased -- and relieved -- at the progress I'd made through kindergarten. Although I had known no English when I arrived to be their son, I had become fluent enough for my age and was deemed by teachers to be &quot;capable of doing above average work&quot; as my first-grade year began. That evening, as my family sat around the kitchen table in our fixed seating positions, wedged in our small, cramped kitchen, conversation turned to various topics among my still-new siblings.   &quot;You should go out for basketball, so we could nickname you Wilt!&quot; my middle sister declared to my brother.  She looked pleased with the nickname she'd thought of on the spot for my brother.  She loved sports, and she particularly liked Wilt Chamberlain, then star center for the Los Angeles Lakers, because the team used to be Minnesota's professional basketball team until 1958, named after &quot;The Land of 10,000 Lakes.&quot; Despite Los Angeles being in a desert, the team kept the name after it moved to LA.  &quot;What's a nickname?&quot; I asked in my first grader voice. I still spoke with a noticeable accent. Although I understood English reasonably well, like any first grader, there were words I didn't know.  &quot;It's a name that people call you that's not your real name, because it may describe something about you or something you're known for,&quot; my oldest sister supplied the answer. She took her job as the eldest very seriously and liked being the knowledgeable and mature one, to my brother's great annoyance.  &quot;Your sister was comparing your brother to a famous basketball player whose name is Wilt Chamberlain. And Mr. Chamberlain has a nickname -- Wilt the Stilt -- because he's so tall.&quot;  &quot;Well, I have a nickname!&quot; I blurted out the new word that I'd just learned.  My mother and father, and all my new, blonde-haired, blue-eyed siblings turned and looked at me, as I sat in my infant's high chair at the foot of the table.  At seven years old, I'd been so starved and deprived of food for most of my life, I was barely more than the size of a two year-old.  &quot;Oh? What is it and who gave it to you?&quot; My dad's bass voice boomed the question, the sound bounding around the tiny kitchen. He was smiling, clearly encouraging me to speak.  &quot;Yeah, what is it?&quot; A chorus of the family's voices chimed in, all of them smiling and nodding and looking at me expectantly.  Encouragingly.  &quot;It's Joe Ching-Chong Chink!&quot;  Dead silence and blank stares.  I had made my proclamation with a burst of pride. I had nearly shouted the words, because I had a nickname! Like some famous basketball player!  &quot;Some of the bigger boys at school gave it to me. And they call me that all the time!&quot; I was smiling and pleased at the new word I had learned and the news I was able to share.  There was complete silence around the table. The smiles had vanished from every face. Everyone just stared at me through a long, too-tight-in-the-collar silence.   I found the silence frightening. I shut off my smile immediately and thought that I was in trouble. I thought I'd done something very wrong. I still didn't understand all the American rules and thought I might be sent back to Korea -- back to starvation -- if I broke them. And that terrified me. I felt a knot in my stomach, and I suddenly didn't feel very hungry and I started to tremble.  It was then that my mother reached out to me and touched my hand and held it in hers.  She locked her bright blue eyes with me and gently explained that I had done nothing wrong and that no one was angry with me. But she explained in a clear, calm voice, that what I was being called was not a nickname. She explained that words were not all equal, that some were good, but others were bad and hurtful and fueled by ignorance. Her voice went on to tell me never to use such words to describe myself or anyone else; that I needed to remember how bad I felt, so that I would never use such ignorance-driven words to make others feel bad.  So where and how does racism begin?  I'm not sure that any of us can really know the answer, but I do know that it can start with simple words. Words have power and can lead to ideas. And ugly ideas can kill.  Racism, as a concept, began for me at my dinner table when I was seven. I learned that words matter -- they can and do affect people. As I grew, I learned that thoughts arise from the words we have and use. And that thoughts precede actions -- both for good and, sometimes, for evil.  But I also learned that keeping silent in the face of racism -- being unwilling to talk about it and the reality of its existence and therefore letting it ferment in the dimly lit crevasses of society out of polite conversation -- may be complicit in its origins and growth.    Years later, my mother shared with me how powerless she'd felt that day. And how ashamed she had been of our society and herself; that she could not protect even a small child from the ugliness of ignorance and hate.  She said that it was then that she knew that love -- her love -- could not protect me from racial hate. Instead, it must be the moral courage, the willingness of us all, to confront and acknowledge racism for the evil that it is, which may hold the best promise of limiting its destructiveness.  Joel L.

If people are still gonna try to make it happen, it’s not gonna happen. I think that’s a good PSA to do,&quot; said actor Jonathan Bennett. &quot;Stop trying to make fetch happen! It hasn’t happened because you're trying to make it happen.&quot;  Though you may know him best as Lindsay Lohan's &quot;Mean Girls&quot; crush Aaron Samuels, Bennett has actually been all over Hollywood lately. The actor is now hosting Food Network's new show &quot;Cake Wars,&quot; which he promises has &quot;ten thousand times&quot; the suspense of &quot;Cupcake Wars,&quot; and is also acting in a number of other shows, including the final season of MTV's &quot;Awkward.&quot;   Bennett recently opened up to The Huffington Post about his new hosting gig, his acting roles and even those reports that he was against a &quot;Mean Girls&quot; reunion:   Image: Giphy  You're hosting &quot;Cake Wars&quot; now, so we have to know: Is butter a carb? According to Regina George and the judges of &quot;Cake Wars,&quot; we have concluded that butter is a carb. And it’s also delicious.   Food competition shows always seem to come down to the last second, but what's it really like? I'm not gonna lie to you. When I started, I thought exactly what some people at home might think where they stage stuff and create the drama. I was totally blown away and totally wrong ... When you have a cake artist trying to create the stuff they're creating in only 4 hours, things are bound to go wrong. When I'm counting down from 10, I'm actually watching them put the finishing touches on the cake. And there are so many times that I hold my breath.  If cakes were at war, which would win? German chocolate. I mean, according to history. I would have to say German chocolate.   Do people always tell you when it's October 3rd? October 3rd is national &quot;Mean Girls&quot; day.

I play Jenna's new boss for her summer internship, and I put her through the wringer... he’s a really funny, quirky and out-of-this-world character. I'm so excited to be playing him.   There were a bunch of reports that you're against a &quot;Mean Girls&quot; reunion. What's the deal there? To clear the record, it’s not that I don’t want to have a &quot;Mean Girls&quot; reunion. I'm just tired about everyone asking about it. Because if I knew, you would know. It’s not that I don’t want there to be a reunion. It’s just I don’t know when, so that’s what I always say. &quot;Mean Girls&quot; reunions are like &quot;fetch.&quot; [laughs].  There you go, &quot;Mean Girls&quot; fans.

My son Seamus wears a dress.  Actually he has two: a dark pink long-sleeved ballerina number with a leotard top and a short sleeved princess dress with pearls and ribbons. They are both pilled and stained, and they disintegrate a little more with each wash. The dresses were already well loved by his cousin Leah before they were passed on to us last Christmas. We planned on storing them up in the attic to await baby Madeline's Fancy Nancy stage, but Seamus seized them right out of the box and pointed out that they were just his size. There was no telling him that the dresses were for Madeline.  Now, both dresses are a little snug and I warn him each time I squeeze his sturdy body into one of them that this might be the last time.  But for now, and as long as it fits, he rocks out an urban princess look that is all his own -- tutu, leggings, running shoes -- at least once a week. People don't recognize him. The crossing guard asks if we have a friend visiting. Others say things like &quot;What a beautiful little girl.&quot; On Facebook, I posted a picture of Seamus and his sister Rosena both wearing dresses and lots of friends thought Madeline had grown up extra fast. They just saw the dress, not the kid wearing it.  Patrick and I don't let him wear the dresses every day -- they get filthy really fast for one and what's more it takes extra energy to explain our small boy princess to a narrow world. But it is always a good exercise when we do it and results in interesting conversations. Turns out, lots of little boys want to wear dresses and, for the most part, the parents we chat with try to keep it on the down low. They call it &quot;dress up&quot; and keep it in the house, which is too bad. I think there is no harm at all in letting boys wear dresses in public -- in fact, maybe it can nudge our culture away from its gender rigidity.  Research shows that a strict gender education for girls and boys starts at birth. Terrence Real, a family therapist and author of I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression, cites a study in which 204 parents watch a video of an infant crying and are asked to react. When told the baby is a girl, mothers and fathers both say that the child is frightened. When told they are watching a boy infant cry, they label the emotion as anger. The researchers, John and Sandra Cundry, concluded by writing, &quot;It would seem reasonable to assume that a child who is thought to be afraid is held and cuddled more than a child who is thought to be angry.&quot;  Little boys who cry are told to &quot;man up.&quot; Aggressive and even violent little boy behavior is not corrected or redirected. Little boys' independence and adventuring is praised, while their need for help and support is labeled &quot;girly.&quot; Little boys' interest in all forms of violent male archetypes is nurtured and encouraged: cowboys, police officers, pirates, soldiers, superheroes -- these men are all armed to the teeth and licensed to kill.  Maybe if we treated more little boys like little girls, boys would not grow up so disconnected from their emotions, so violent and so unable to ask for help. Cuddle your boys. Let them dance around in tutus.  Seamus will say, &quot;I want to wear underpants and a tutu and have a Dar Williams dance party.&quot; Then he and his two sisters will flail around to &quot;FM Radio,&quot; one of the only danceable songs (on her new album, the song is bookended by slow, beautiful tear jerkers, so we put it on repeat).  He talks about gender and sexuality all the time.  &quot;Mama, look at my long hair,&quot; Seamus will say, as he wears a laundry basket on his head, shaking back and forth to feel it on his back. &quot;You are very beautiful,&quot; I tell him.  &quot;Mama, I want pigtails,&quot; he says when we are in the bathroom and I am putting up my hair. I then put his little tufts of hair into rubber bands too. He smiles at his reflection and then pulls them out. &quot;Not comfortable, mom,&quot; he says.  &quot;Mama, I am the mommy and you are the daddy horse. I am nursing my baby horses.&quot; Seamus says this as he plays with his big sister's horses on our bed. &quot;You are a really good mom, Seamus,&quot; I tell him.  If I were worried about all of this or looking for context or support, I could take to the Internet and find a lot of common cause. There are resources and analysis and communities. There is a great book called &quot;Parenting Beyond Pink and Blue: How To Raise Your Child Free of Gender Stereotypes,&quot; written by Christia Spears Brown, a developmental psychologist and professor at University of Kentucky. Brown encourages parents to allow their kids to be &quot;free to flourish&quot; without a lot of gendered expectations and uses a lot of studies (and humor) to back it all up. She is also practical, giving advice on birthday parties, friendships and television. There are clothing-design companies tilting at the pink vs. blue kid-wardrobe windmills that offer attractive, thoughtful, comfy clothes for kids of all sexes and shapes. (Be warned, however: They are pretty pricey, especially for a family of consummate thrifters and hand-me-down acceptors.) There are parents organizing around school dress codes and for safe (and fun) spaces for all kids.  If I had to guess, I would say that I don't think Seamus wants to be a girl. I don't think he will grow up to be a mom. He wants to be a boy with more options. Hey, Jaden Pickett Smith -- who starred in the reboot of The Karate Kid -- wore a dress to his prom this spring.  Seamus's drawers are full of T-shirts and sweat pants and there just isn't all that much to get excited about in there. His sisters have options -- they can wear bright, colorful, bedazzled frocks some days and clothes that are more function than form on other days. Neither of them have to endure society's concern/scorn about their gender confusion.  Seamus sometimes thinks that I used to be a boy, or that he might grow up to be a woman, or that our friends who are women are men and vice versa. He asks a lot of questions about who are boys and girls and men and women. He pays very close attention to what people wear. He knows he is a boy and has started to correct people who mistake him for a girl when he is wearing a dress. He also knows that his daddy is a man. He understands what equipment comes with that designation, but he is also trying on gender roles, exploring sexuality and -- in play and in conversation -- figuring it all out. He is not the only one.  Vanity Fair's most talked about cover in forever is a portrait of Caitlyn Jenner. But Jenner's hyper-publicized transformation from &quot;living a lie every day&quot; to feeling &quot;finally free&quot; is about more than one person's (very expensive) quest for full-realization. It is an opportunity to talk about the intersections of gender and sexuality (and class and race).  It is a conversation I am only just now learning how to have at 41. As I have it with my son and my daughters, with my husband and our friends and people we meet in the world, I am trying to check my straight (but not narrow), hetero-normative biases. I am trying to give my son more than two choices.  Frida Berrigan's Little Insurrections column appears regularly on Waging Nonviolence.

A baby's delicate skin is particularly vulnerable in the summer, and cumulative sun damage starts on day one. No pressure, parents and grandparents! And it's not just me thinking about what to recommend for my grandbaby Harry, but my patients, who have new little ones to watch over, and are constantly asking for advice on protecting their children and grandchildren. In fact, a bulk of my day is spent doling out advice on the topic. So here you go: A guide to shielding the smallest members of your family from the sun.   #1: Baby Your Baby  While it's important for us adults to protect ourselves from UV rays, we have a wide variety of lotions and creams available to slather on ourselves. Infants have more sensitive skin and so require more TLC and gentler formulas, while no SPF is recommended for infants under the age of 6 months, if it is unavoidable, pick a broad-spectrum with at least an SPF of 45 specifically designed for babies. These use physical barriers like titanium dioxide, rather than potentially irritating chemical ones, and are fragrance-free and hypoallergenic. They are available at different prices points from budget-friendly Neutrogena's Pure &amp; Free Baby Sunscreen to splurge-worthy California Baby No Fragrance SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion. If your little one is going to be splashing around in the paddling pool or ocean, be sure to use a water-resistant formula like Coola Baby SPF 50, which keeps doing its thing even when wet. But do make sure you reapply once your child is on dry land. A spray probably seems like the easiest way to get that SPF onto a fidgety toddler, but think again. To get the protection promised on the outside of the bottle, you need to spray the same spot for six seconds, otherwise a quick spritz will only provide the equivalent of a SPF 7. Lotion really is the best option.   #2: Practice Responsible Application  Twenty minutes before heading out, slather your son or daughter in SPF to give it time to absorb so it won't slide off your soon-to-be sweaty baby. Avoid the area around their eyes if you don't want a flood of tears and likewise, the palms, which will most likely end up in the eyes. Be sure you don't miss the usual forgotten spots including the ears, nape of the neck, backs of the knees, ankles, and armpits. And you know how your kid won't sit still? Neither will his or her clothing, which means you need to apply sunscreen one inch beyond the border of their clothing to avoid hot spots. Then apply SPF every two hours. Keep a small bottle of SPF in your diaper bag so you're ready to reapply. Stickers and bracelets can be worn to help gauge whether the little one has had too much sun. If the UV index is high, then plan for an indoor day.   #3: Make Your Own Shade  One great thing about plopping your kid in a stroller? Built-in sun protection! Those handy-dandy hoods provide an equivalent of SPF 50 as long as you don't open the &quot;sunroof.&quot; And while child-size sunglasses aka baby-ators look adorable they also provide an excellent way to shield tiny eyes from the glare of the sun. That t-shirt on the other hand doesn't do your baby any sun-protective favors. In fact, it barely provides SPF 8 level protection. Luckily, there is clothing made from a wondrous fabric with UPF or Ultraviolet Protection Factor, which is equivalent to SPF (e.g., UPF 50 equals SPF 50). Which means you don't have to deal with trying to slather your squirmy worm of a baby in head-to-toe sun protection every couple hours. Brands like Coolibar even make full-body baby rashguards in cool designs your kids will approve of. Suddenly, a trip to the beach can go on minus struggles with sun protection application. In case you don't want to add to your baby's already extensive wardrobe, you can simply buy SunGuard Sun Protection, a liquid you add to your laundry to transform your regular clothes into sun-blocking marvels for up to 20 washes. And slap a hat on that kid! Babies have finer hair than adults so need more protection up top. Protect their little piggies with aqua socks when at the beach.  #4 Have a Recovery Plan  Even if you managed to avoid a burn, any day at the beach can leave your baby's skin as dried out as the Sahara. Skip moisture-sucking daily baths (infants don't need them) in favor of every other. If they are particularly sandy or sweaty, just dunk them in lukewarm water for two minutes to give them a quick rinse. While skin is still damp, slather your baby in a body lotion like Honest Company Face &amp; Body Lotion to preserve the delicate barrier function, and then hold tight so your slippery little one doesn't slide right through your hands. In my house, a sunburn was treated like any illness so on the rare occasion my daughters got one, they had to stay inside until they recovered. Listen, mishaps do happen (even to my kids) to the best of us so if your baby does get burned, take steps to soothe and stave off the pain and inflammation. Apply a topical 1 percent cortisone cream, give them baby Advil, and draw them a cool bath with Aveeno Oatmeal Bath (check you're your pediatrician re: Advil and hydrocortisone). If you see any blistering or have chills or fever consult your dermatologist as soon as possible. And best of all, avoid the beach between the hours of 11 a.m. -- 3 p.m. when the sun is the strongest.   Safety first! Now enjoy the summer. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

When I envision my future, I see one thing for certain: a big happy family (you can laugh at me if you want). Truly, though, there's never been a question in my mind as to whether or not I wanted to raise kids of my own one day. My mom did a pretty swell job raising me, and gave me a lot of quality material to work with when it comes to motherhood, too.  I'm 19, and am in no way planning on having kids any time soon (so you can breathe a sigh of relief, Mom). Over the years, however, I've accumulated some thoughts on what kind of mother I'd like to be someday. These are the things I want my future children to know:  1. I will always accept you.  I don't care who you like, or how good (or bad) you are at math, or how many Kidz Bop CDs you ask me to buy. Hell, wear Crocs every day if you want -- wear whatever makes you feel most confident. Pierce your nose. There are worse things.  2. I won't pry.  I'll try my hardest not to pester you about your homework -- even though I'll ask anyway, because I want you to do the best you can. I know how annoying that can get, so sorry in advance.  3. As long as you're honest with me, I'll cut you some slack.  If you tell me the truth (you know, about wanting to stay over that one &quot;friend's house&quot;), chances are I'll let you. I'll appreciate the fact that you feel comfortable enough to be real with me.  4. I will care too much.  I'll care when you tell me &quot;I don't get it,&quot; (I promise I'm trying to). I'll get upset when the time comes that you're too cool to hang out with your mom. I'll feel the pain of your first breakup as if it happened to me personally. When you hurt, I will hurt.  5. I'll try to be a good cook.  Keyword: TRY. I have less than zero cooking skills now, but I'll do my best to learn. I'll make up for it by, you know, loving you and clothing you and all that good stuff.  6. You won't ever have to question my love for your dad.  In a world where divorce is becoming the norm, you won't have to be afraid that your parents fell out of love, and that it was somehow your fault. Rest easy knowing that when I said &quot;for better or for worse,&quot; I meant it.  7. I'll let you learn on your own.  Learn that the guy who only calls you at night isn't the love of your life. Learn that bad things can and will happen to good people, and that life isn't always fair. Learn that the friends who truly understand you are worth keeping close. These are things that you'll figure out by yourself.  8. I'll be ready with advice when you want it, and give you your space when you don't.  Just know that I probably know more than you'd like to think or admit.  9. I'll be immensely proud of you.  For your two goals in your soccer game, for killing your viola performance, for sitting next to the new boy at lunch, for standing up for yourself and others. I will be your number one supporter, that much is for sure.  10. I'll raise you in a family that appreciates Disney movies and musicals, road trips and hockey games, warm cups of tea and even warmer hugs.  I want to share all of these parts of me with you.   I'm excited to meet you kiddos one day. I'm also scared that I won't live up to your expectations or mine. I can, however, promise you these 10 things though, and for now, I think that's pretty good. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
