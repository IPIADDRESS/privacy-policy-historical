<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us at The Search Agency. The following privacy policy covers The Search Agency's collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information of our clients and of users of our online services through the "Client Control Center" area of our website located at <a href="http://www.thesearchagency.com">www.thesearchagency.com</a> and <a href="http://www.thesearchagents.com">www.thesearchagents.com</a> (the "Site"). For the purposes of this privacy policy, "personal information" or "information" refers to identifying information such as your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, etc. This privacy policy is effective as of December 15, 2009. Please take a moment to read the following to learn about our information collection, storage, use, and disclosure practices.</p>
<h2><br>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</h2>
<p><br>The Search Agency collects relevant personal information because it enables us to give clients convenient access to our services. In particular, personal information is used to create a client profile for clients who register to use our Client Control Center. The Client Control Center provides our clients with tools that help them analyze the performance of advertising campaigns and make adjustments to improve the results of those campaigns. In addition, the collected personal information allows us to notify our clients and other Site users of products and services that we think may be of interest.</p>
<h2><br>Special Offers and Updates</h2>
<p><br>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions.<br><br>Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>
<h2><br>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
<p><br>We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.<br><br>If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by emailing us at info(at)thesearchagency(dot)com with the word “unsubscribe” in the subject line or you may contact us at 888 257-6736 or 11150 W Olympic Blvd, Suite 600, Los Angeles, CA 90064 to opt-out.</p>
<h2><br>Blogs</h2>
<p><br>If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums</p>
<h2><br>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p><br>Information You Give Us. We collect personal information from clients who choose to provide us with this information. For example, we obtain personal information when you register to use our Client Control Center. This information includes, for example, your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, relevant search engine account information, and security or access code/password. Site users and clients can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but then they may not be able to access the Client Control Center or to fully take advantage of certain features of our Site.<br><br>When you use widgets to bookmark or share our products and Site, you will be taken to a third party site. These third party sites also collect additional information about third parties such as name and email address. Please note that their privacy policy governs the collection and use of the information collected on those sites.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Automatic Collection of Information.</h2>
<p><br>Like many websites on the Internet, we employ the use of "cookies" in certain areas of our Site to allow us to provide information which is targeted to Site users and clients' interests. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user's browser from a Web server and stored on their computer's hard drive. We also use the cookies set in our client's websites in order to gather accurate client site tracking information (e.g. clicks, sign-ups, and revenues). We may link the information we store in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our Site, including your name and login ID. We use this information in order to provide services to our clients. You are always free to decline any cookies we use, if your browser permits.<br><br>We use third party companies to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site.<br>&nbsp;</p>
