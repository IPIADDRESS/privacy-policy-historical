  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div><p></p><p></p><p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p><p>CFO Publishing Holdings, Inc. (also referred to in this Privacy Policy as “CFO” “Innovation Enterprise” “ieOnDemand” and with the terms “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of all those who provide us with their contact information while using our websites, products, events, or services (“you” or “Users”). This policy describes the ways that personally identifiable and anonymous information about our publication subscribers, online and digital media product users, and event registrants is collected, how that information might be shared, and how someone can request changes to the way their personal information is used or shared. A current list of the CFO websites covered by this Privacy Policy (the “Sites”) can be found here.linkedi</p><br><p>Collection of User Details and Information</p><p>We may collect personally identifiable and/or anonymous information from you in the course of your use of our websites, products, events, or services (“Services”) as further described in this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is information that can identify you, such as your full name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and fax number. In some cases, you may provide information to us, and in other cases, information about you or your activities on our Services may be automatically collected, as further described below.</p><p>We collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us when you subscribe to our magazines (either directly or through another company such as a subscription agency); sign up for email newsletters or promotions; enter a contest; participate in surveys; register for a website, webcast, mobile application, tradeshow or other online or in-person event; or otherwise communicate with us or interact with the Sites. We also may receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.</p><p>If you use a credit card to pay for a CFO product or service, we may retain your credit card information in order to renew your account in the event you elect to renew your subscription. When we do retain credit card information, we keep it secure and separate from other demographic information you may have given us.</p><p>CFO is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in discussions in our forums or other publicly accessible interactions, or the information that you choose to make public in your member profile. To view or change your member profile, please return to the CFO business site where you registered.</p><br><p>User Details Collected Automatically and Our Uses of Such Information</p><p>Like most website operators, we use cookies (small data files stored on your computer by your web browser upon visiting a website), web beacons, and similar technologies to operate our Services efficiently and as intended. Through such technologies we gather information about you, such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, mobile device identification number, the sites visited before and after our Site, and about your interactions with our Services, such as the time and date when you viewed a page, which advertisements you have clicked on, and whether you filled out an online form. You may set your browser to block all cookies, including CFO’s, while using our Services (in which case some aspects of the Services may not function properly), or you may set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow first-party cookies, which would allow us (but not third parties) to collect such information while you are on our Sites. In addition, some browsers may allow you to block certain web beacons and similar tracking codes. Please refer to your browser’s documentation if you wish to block some or all cookies, web beacons, and/or similar tools.</p><p>We use information gathered through these tools to improve the way our Sites work, for example by employing third-party analytics tools which aggregate anonymized user information to help us better design our Sites, and to enhance the functionality of our Services, for example by remembering preferences or other choices that you make, such as user names, language preferences, and the like. By allowing us to understand how you use our Sites over time, these tools can help us provide you with a better, more relevant online experience. In addition, we may work with third-party advertising companies to target and serve advertising you see on the Services or on third-party sites based on preferences gleaned from such information. For example, we work with a company called Bizo that may, based on your activities on our Sites and/or third party sites in Bizo’s network, serve ads for our or third-party products to you when you visit another site in Bizo’s network. You can review Bizo’s privacy policy at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bizo.com/privacy_policy">http://www.bizo.com/privacy_policy</a>, and can opt-out of Bizo-targeted advertising at<a href="http://www.bizo.com/businessProfessionals/opt_out">http://www.bizo.com/businessProfessionals/opt_out</a>.</p><br><p>Third-Party Cookies and Tracking Technologies&nbsp;<br></p><p>Certain third parties may also employ cookies, web beacons, and/or similar technologies on our Services. Information collected through such third-party tools is gathered directly by such third party, not by CFO, and is subject to such third party's applicable privacy policy. CFO has no control over such third-party tools. These third parties include but are not limited to analytics partners who help us better understand how our users are interacting with our Services and advertising, providers of widgets and other third-party applications that may appear in our Services, ad servers, ad networks, ad agencies, and advertisers. You may visit these third parties' sites to learn more about their privacy practices. In addition, as noted above, you may set your browser to block third-party cookies. Finally, you may visit the industry websites described in the next section to learn more about the privacy practices of a wide range of ad networks and data companies and to exercise certain opt-out options made available there.</p><p>Our Sites may include social media features, such as the Facebook button and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. On some of our Sites, you can log in using sign-in services such as Gravatar or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like these give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p><br><p>Industry Resources Regarding Online Behavioral Advertising</p><p>Most of the third-party advertising and data companies with whom we work (including Bizo) are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). NAI offers a tool that will allow you to opt-out of behavioral advertising by NAI members at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, and the DAA offers a similar opt-out tool regarding behavioral advertising by its members at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. Finally, the DAA manages its Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (“Self-Regulatory Program”); if you are served an ad by a third party that follows the Self-Regulatory Program, you may click on the Advertising Option Icon (the letter “i” in a blue triangle) or related phrases (e.g., “Why did I get this ad?,” “Interest Based Ads,” or “Ad Choices”) to learn more about applicable behavioral advertising practices and opt-out options.</p><br><p>Use of User Details and Information</p><br><p>We may use your contact information to send you account notices, including subscription renewals or registration confirmation, and to provide you with information about products or services you’ve ordered or which we think may be of interest to you.

Each e-newsletter will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from that particular e-newsletter. Unsubscribing from one newsletter will not affect delivery of other newsletters.</p><p>In some cases, we may send you relevant, carefully screened offers from reputable third party businesses or organizations. Many of our customers appreciate receiving these offers because they relate to their business or occupation. However, you will always be able to opt-out of receiving future third party offers.</p><p>All promotional and research email messages you receive from us will include an option to opt-out of future email communications from that particular CFO product, service, event, or brand.</p><p>User Details and Information We Share with Third Parties</p><p>We may provide personally identifiable information to those acting as our agents in providing our products and services, including third-party companies we have employed to provide us with specialized services, including customer service, subscription fulfillment, research, statistical analysis, list cleansing, postal mailings, email and fax deployment, telemarketing, and other information services. In compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to those third-party companies so that they can be suppressed from the communications those companies send on CFO's behalf.</p><p>From time to time our sponsors wish to contact our subscribers and customers who have indicated an interest in the products, services or events provided by such sponsors. If you register for products or services offered by such sponsors or third parties, or for events sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, or otherwise opt-in to permit us to share your personally identifiable information, then you may receive communications directly from such third parties. If you provide information on a co-branded site or while using a co-branded service, you grant us permission to share the information you have provided with that service or site partner. Their use of your information is subject to their privacy policies and we urge you to read those policies and be aware of their privacy practices before registering.</p><br><p>In addition, we may share your contact information with sponsors who appear in a particular e-newsletter of ours if you click on their link in the e-newsletter. If you do NOT wish to have your email address shared with that e-newsletter's sponsors, you will be given an opportunity within the e-newsletter to opt-out.</p><p>CFO also shares the information it gathers in a compiled format with advertisers and other partners. The compiled format does not include personally identifiable information.</p><p>Quality Control of User Generated Content</p><p>CFO uses a third party to monitor user-generated content posted on our websites. When you submit a comment on a CFO website, our third-party service provider, Automattic, may collect, analyze, and store information about you and the content you submit for anti-spam and quality monitoring purposes via its Akismet tool as set forth in Automattic’s privacy policy available at&nbsp;<a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">http://automattic.com/privacy/</a>.</p><br><p>User Details and Information Transfer</p><p>CFO is based in the United States of America.

Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p><p>In the case of a change of ownership or a merger involving CFO or any business that is part of CFO, your contact information associated with that business would be one of those transferred assets. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
