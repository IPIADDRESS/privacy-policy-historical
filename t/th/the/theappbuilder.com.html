								<h2>IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES</h2>
								<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
								<p>For the same reason, if you visit our site we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our service and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:</p>
						
								<ul class="bullet-list">
									<li>to estimate our audience size and usage pattern;</li>
									<li>to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site according to your individual interests;</li>
									<li>to speed up your searches; and</li>
									<li>to recognise you when you return to our site.</li>
								</ul>
						
								<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.</p>
								<p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>
								<p>You can find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
								
								<h2>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
								
								<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including by any member of our group (meaning any parent undertaking or subsidiary undertaking of us, as those terms are defined at section 1162 of the United Kingdom's Companies Act 2006). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our app and/or our site; accordingly, by consenting to this privacy policy you are accepting that any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use appropriate procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

Please note that if you do withdraw your consent we may be unable to provide some or all of our services, and/or the use of our app, to you, and you accept and acknowledge that it is therefore reasonable that we have no liability to you in any such event.</p>
