	    <h4>C. Specific Guidance</h4>
	      <p>In addition to the information provided above, this Section provides additional information regarding how ASU Processes your EU Personal Data in specific situations.</p>
	      <p><strong>Applications for Student Admissions from the EU.</strong> This part applies if, while you are in the EU, you apply for admission as a student to ASU (including as an exchange or visiting student), whether you intend to attend ASU online, remotely, or on campus, and whether you submit your application through ASU’s online student application portals (<a href="https://students.asu.edu/apply">Undergraduate</a>, <a href="https://students.asu.edu/graduate/apply-graduate-admission">Graduate</a>), through a third party such as the <a href="https://students.asu.edu/apply">Common Application</a>, or directly via communications with an ASU department, program, or school. ASU may use the details you provide on your application, together with any supporting documents you submit, additional details and documents provided by any references or third parties, including education records and financial aid applications and records, and any records made by ASU during the application process.</p>
	      <p>In addition to the uses described in Part B above, we will process the EU Personal Data obtained during your application process for the purposes of identifying you, processing your application, verifying the information provided, deciding whether to offer you admission, and communicating that outcome. We may also use or disclose this information for the following statutory or public interest purposes: to prevent or detect fraud; for disciplinary or academic integrity proceedings; to meet reporting obligations, such as to state or federal Departments of Education; to help us to make reasonable decisions regarding accommodations for a disability, as requested by you; and for research and statistical purposes, but none of your EU Personal Data that can identify you will be published.</p>
	      <p>We consider the Processing of your EU Personal Data in connection with your student application process to be necessary for us to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with you (e.g., to assess your application to study with us), necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or necessary for the performance of tasks we carry out in the public interest (e.g., admissions research). We require you to provide ASU the information we request during the application process to assess your application properly.</p>
	      <p>As well as circulating your application and related materials to the appropriate people at ASU, we may share your EU Personal Data, as relevant and necessary, with your references, with entities that provide services to, or on behalf of, ASU, and with governmental organizations. 
If you are accepted, ASU will include in your ASU student files the EU Personal Data collected during your application process.</p>
	      <p><strong>Enrollment and Participation in Programs and Courses while in the EU - Overview.</strong> ASU offers the opportunity to participate in ASU courses and programs while you are in the EU, including while traveling, and online through ASU’s technology network. If you desire to participate in an ASU course or program in the EU, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Data necessary for admission, registration, enrollment, and participation in the course or program. This information may include, among other things, your name, email address, date of birth, and registration information. Enrollment and participation in ASU courses and programs and receipt of related services while you are in the EU is a contractual obligation between ASU and you, and ASU will need your EU Personal Data to deliver these services to you.</p>
	      <p>In addition to the uses described in Part B above, we use the EU Personal Data we collect from you when you enroll and participate in ASU courses or programs while in the EU for Processing purposes, including tracking attendance, progress, and completion of a course or program. We may also share your EU Personal Data and your performance in a course or program with the instructors, teaching assistants, and other individuals designated by ASU to assist with the creation, modification, or operation of the courses or programs, and for research and statistical purposes, but none of your EU Personal Data that can identify you will be published.</p>
	      <p><em>Online.</em> If you participate in courses or programs while in the EU on or through ASU’s technology network, we will collect from you certain student-generated content, such as assignments you submit to instructors, peer-graded assignments and peer grading student feedback. We also collect course data, such as student responses to in-video quizzes, stand-alone quizzes, exams, and surveys, online proctoring data and information, and other course, program, and degree related information.</p>
	      <p><em>Study or Travel Abroad.</em> ASU travel and study abroad programs include academic and other ASU programs (such as travel with an ASU team). If you are an ASU student participating in an ASU travel or study abroad program, ASU requires that you sign a GDPR Contract and Consent before your leave the United States. ASU’s Contract and Consent allows ASU to use your Personal Data collected while you are in the EU. ASU also needs to be able to Process your Personal Data regarding your coursework as necessary to maintain your educational and degree records consistent with ASU policies, legitimate pedagogical purposes, and any applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.</p>
	      <p><strong>Disclosure of Student Personal Data.</strong> The United States Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<strong>FERPA</strong>), Arizona law, and ASU policy provide ASU students with the right to limit access to their Personal Data. Due to the GDPR's requirements, if you are participating in ASU courses or programs on or through ASU's technology network while you are in the EU, ASU will endeavor to restrict third parties from access to your EU Personal Data that is directory information, as described and defined in ASU's <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm107-01.html">Student Services Manual in Section 107-01</a>.

We may also use or disclose this information for the following statutory or public interest purposes: to prevent or detect fraud; to help us to make decisions regarding accommodations for a disability that are requested by you; and for research and statistical purposes, but no EU Personal Data that can identify you will be published in connection with research or for statistical purposes.</p>

We require you to provide us with the information we ask for during the employment process to assess your application properly.</p>
	      <p>As well as circulating your application and related materials to the appropriate people at ASU, we may share your EU Personal Data, as relevant and necessary, with your references, and with entities that provide services to, or on behalf of, ASU, such as background checks. If you are hired, ASU will include in your personnel employment files EU Personal Data collected as part of your employment process.</p>
	      <p><strong>ASU Alumni in the European Union.</strong> Developing a better understanding of our alumni allows ASU to keep in touch, to keep alumni apprised of ASU’s activities and developments, to provide services to alumni, and to identify ways alumni can support ASU, through donations or other forms of financial and non-financial support. For information regarding how ASU uses alumni EU Personal Data, please refer to the Guidance at <a href="https://alumni.asu.edu/">alumni.asu.edu</a>.</p>

	      <p><strong>Research.</strong> As a Tier 1 Research University, the conduct of research is a fundamental part of ASU’s mission. Research at ASU is supported by ASU’s Office of Knowledge Enterprise Development <a href="https://researchadmin.asu.edu">researchadmin.asu.edu</a>, consistent with applicable research grants and agreements, to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.

	      <p><strong>ASU Service Providers.</strong> ASU may contract with non-ASU service providers, vendors, and contractors (<strong>Contractors</strong>) to assist ASU in providing services. These Contractors may have access to and may collect or otherwise Process your EU Personal Data as necessary to perform the services for ASU. These Contractors, for example, may provide ASU with network, website, platform, server, technology, services, course and program content and delivery, and administrative and student-related services, such as those related to providing ASU study abroad or other courses or programs offered to individuals in the EU. Access to your EU Personal Data by these Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary to perform their contracted functions. ASU requires Contractors to protect Personal Data on our behalf. We do not permit third parties to sell Personal Data we have shared with them.</p>
	      <p><strong>Transfer to Third Parties.</strong> ASU will transfer your EU Personal Data to third parties only where ASU is comfortable that they will protect your EU Personal Data.

	      <p><strong>Government Authorities, Legal Rights and Actions.</strong> ASU may share your EU Personal Data with various government authorities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
