					<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

					<p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on and is effective as of January 18th, 2014.</p>
					<p>Ace Hardware Corporation ("Ace Hardware" or "we" or "us") recognizes that you care how information about you is collected and used. We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you of our general information collection, use and sharing practices for our consumer-facing websites and other consumer-facing online and mobile applications and services that link to this Privacy Policy (“Online Services”), online communications through or related to the Online Services, and offline communications through our Customer Service Department in connection with the Online Services, and do not necessarily reflect our practices with respect to information gathered through other websites that we operate or through other offline means.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Personal Information is information that personally identifies you, such as your full name, address, email address, phone number, and credit card information.</p>
					<p>By downloading, installing, accessing or using any of the Online Services or by submitting information to us in a manner governed by this Privacy Policy, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact our Customer Service Department by email at <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="mailto:customersupport@acehardware.com">customersupport@acehardware.com</a>.</p>

					<h3>What Information About Me Is Collected?</h3>

					<h4>Information You Provide</h4>
					<p>We collect and store information that you provide through the Online Services, that you otherwise provide to us online, or that you provide to our Customer Service Department in connection with the Online Services. For example, information will be collected when you open or manage an account or an Ace Rewards membership account, when you place an order, when you sign up to receive emails, newsletters or other promotional communications, when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, when you contact us with online inquiries and/or when you otherwise voluntarily submit or provide information to us. The information we collect that you provide to us may include, but is not limited to: names, billing addresses, shipping addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, Ace Rewards membership ID numbers, credit card numbers and expiration dates, account and log-in IDs, passwords, information regarding orders, demographic information, and information regarding interests and preferences. This information is used for the purpose for which it was collected and for administrative and analytical purposes. For example, the information is used to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations, to manage billing and payment processes, to operate the Ace Rewards program, to provide emails, newsletters and other communications you have requested, to administer and fulfill sweepstakes and contests, to conduct audits, to manage our information and financial systems, and to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, product recommendations, special offers and new site features from Ace Hardware and other selected vendors, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications from us. When you opt not to receive emails, newsletters or other promotional information, we collect and store certain information, such as your email address, in order to comply with your preferences regarding such materials.</p>

					<h4>Information We Collect Through Technologies</h4>
					<p>Like many online services, we use technologies to collect and store certain other information whenever you interact with our Online Services. For example, we collect your IP address, browser and device information, including operating system, application software, and reference site domain name, every time you access or use the Online Services. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and usage and mobile application usage data. This information is used to analyze and improve the Online Services and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.</p>

					<h5>Cookies</h5>
					<p>Like many online services, we use cookies, which are small data files created by a Web server and stored by your browser, for analytical purposes. Cookies also help us to identify account holders and Ace Rewards members and to optimize the log-in, account management, and shopping experience. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves without checking out. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use some features of the Online Services.  To learn more about cookies and how to disable them, please consult the “Help” feature of your browser or your device’s user guide or visit <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank" class="txt">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>.</p>

					<h5>Interest-Based Advertising</h5>
					<p>We and our ad management partner(s) collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites so we can manage advertising effectiveness and provide you with online advertisements, including advertisements on the websites of third parties not affiliated with Ace Hardware, more likely to be of interest to you. We may use web beacons (also known as action tags, pixels, or transparent GIF files) and similar technologies to help manage online advertising. These technologies are provided by our ad management partner(s) and enable our ad management partner(s) to recognize a unique cookie. The cookie was placed by us (when you accessed the acehardware.com website) or by another advertiser who works with our ad management partner(s). These technologies also allow us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Online Services. With web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain Personal Information.</p>
					<p>For more information about interest-based advertising (often referred to as online behavioral advertising) and how to manage your preferences for interest-based ads, please visit <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>To opt out of receiving customized interest-based advertisements from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), please visit the DAA website by <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">clicking here</a>.</strong></p>

					<h5 style="font-weight: bold">Location Information</h5>
					<p>We may also collect information about your location when you access or use our Online Services.</p>

Push notifications, which appear on the screen of your mobile device in the form of a badge, alert, or banner, allow mobile applications to send information to your mobile device even when the application is not in use. You may choose to receive push notifications without consenting to the collection of geolocation information, but the messages you receive will not be customized for your location.  Your mobile device's operating system may store your authorization to provide us with information regarding your location.  While your authorization is active, if you access or request location-based services from our Online Services, your mobile device will provide us with your location without additional authorization from you.

					<h4>Other Information</h4>
					<p>We may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, such as the U.S Postal Service National Change of Address (NCOA) service and providers of consumer data, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.</p>
