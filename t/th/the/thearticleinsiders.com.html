    <p class="articletitle"><b>The Article Insiders: Article Directory Privacy
    Policy</b></p>
    <p>The Article Insiders strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
    Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
    experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,
    e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of
    this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address
    to any unauthorized third party. Period. <br>
    <br>
    How we gather information from users How we collect and store information
    depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to
    participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to
    provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our
    site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a
    purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes
    and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of
    our site. Like most Web sites, TheArticleInsiders.com also collects
    information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may
    be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
    Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold
    information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your
    user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
    each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
    particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
    technology, we may also gather information through other means. <br>
    <br>
    In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
    example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do
    you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to
    re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize
    the site's features according to your preferences. What we do with the
    information we collect Like other Web publishers, we collect information to
    enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
    We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.
    Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
    may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your
    usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help
    enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most
    or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may
    occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again,
    this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information
    about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. <br>
    <br>
    We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
    www.TheArticleInsiders.com to communicate with you about your registration
    and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;
    services and products offered by www.TheArticleInsiders.com and other topics
    we think you might find of interest. Personally Identifiable Information
    collected by TheArticleInsiders.com may also be used for other purposes,
    including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,
    processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and
    contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who
    provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting
    service for example) may access such information. We will use your
    information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we
    continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
    other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
    among the transferred assets. <br>
    <br>
    We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other
    times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in
    connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law
    enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please
    note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
    Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements TheArticleInsiders.com
    expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of
    our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners,
    advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our
    site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
    For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part
    of a frame on a www.TheArticleInsiders.com page, certain content that is
    actually created or hosted by a third party. <br>
    <br>
    Also, through TheArticleInsiders.com you may be introduced to, or be able to
    access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by
    other parties. TheArticleInsiders.com is not responsible for the actions or
    policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy
    policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or
    page operated by a third party. While on our site, our advertisers,
    promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other
    technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve
    information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by
    third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to
    determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other
    features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties
    and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. <br>
    <br>
    TheArticleInsiders.com does not control the use of this technology by third
    parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions
    or policies of such third parties. You should also be aware that if you
    voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards
    or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be
    collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in
    unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such
    activities are beyond the control of TheArticleInsiders.com and this policy.
    Children TheArticleInsiders.com does not knowingly collect or solicit
    Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except
    as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a
    child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
    immediately. <br>
    <br>
    If you believe TheArticleInsiders.com has any information from or about
    anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.
    <a href="mailto:admin@thearticleinsiders.com">Contacting Us</a> We can be
    reached by emailing us. Changes to this Policy TheArticleInsiders.com
    reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page
    periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the
    posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
    Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used
    according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was
    collected. <br>
    <br>
    If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it
    with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location:
    Austin. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the
    mediation will be shared equally by each of us. If it proves impossible to
    arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to
    submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following location: Austin,
    under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the
    award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with
    jurisdiction to do so. This statement and the policies outlined herein are
    not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in
    or on behalf of any party.<br><br>
