<p><strong><u>TheraNest Privacy Policy</u></strong></p>
<p><em>This Policy was last updated on July 24, 2018.</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the personal information we receive or collect from you.&nbsp; We also believe in transparency and are committed to informing you about how we treat your personal information.</p>
<p>TheraNest (also referred to as “we,” “us,” and “our”) has established this Privacy Policy, together with our Terms of Service (<span><a href="/terms">https://www.theranest.com/terms</a></span>) and any documents referenced therein, to provide you with clear and concise information regarding the nature of the information collected via (a) the public portions of <span><a href="http://www.theranest.com">www.theranest.com</a></span> and <a href="http://www.therapadapp.com">www.therapadapp.com</a> (the “Websites”); (b) our cloud-based electronic health record and practice management software, accessible via the password-protected portions of the Websites and the TheraNest and TheraPad mobile applications (together, the “Apps”); (c) our telehealth platform, which is accessible via the Websites (the “Telehealth Platform”); and (d) those portions of the Apps which may be accessed by patients at the direction of the health care providers who subscribe to TheraNest (the “Client Portal”) (The Websites, the Apps, the Telehealth Platform, and the Client Portal are collectively referred to herein as the “Services”) as well as the ways in which we use and share this information.&nbsp; This Policy also describes certain rights and options that you have with regard to your personal information.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE TREAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHAT CHOICES AND RIGHTS YOU HAVE IN THIS REGARD.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>

<p><strong><u><br>How long do we store your personal information?</u></strong></p>
<p>TheraNest will retain personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.&nbsp; We will retain and use personal information as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide our services, and to enforce our agreements. We will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers.</p>
<p>When we no longer have a purpose to retain personal information, we will securely destroy the personal information in accordance with applicable law and our policies. We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we collect if your registration to use our Services lapses and you opt out of receiving further communications from us, or if you ask us to delete information, unless we determine that doing so would violate our existing, legitimate legal, regulatory, dispute resolution, contractual, or similar obligations.&nbsp; We may retain and use anonymous and aggregated information for performance reporting, benchmarking, and analytic purposes and for product and service improvement. When permitted, aggregated and de-identified data is only created in accordance with HIPAA and any controlling business associate agreement.</p>
<p><strong><u>Choices</u></strong></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive communications from us via email, you may opt-out by contacting us at info@theranest.com and providing the name of the service for which information was provided, your full name, mailing address, phone number and email address so that we may identify you in the opt-out process. Once we receive your instruction, we will promptly take corrective action.</p>
<p><strong><u>How do we protect information?</u></strong></p>
<p>TheraNest has put in place reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and security measures to protect personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered, or disclosed.&nbsp; While our security measures seek to protect the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of your personal information in our possession, no security system is perfect and TheraNest cannot promise that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances.</p>
<p>The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access to the Apps, the Telehealth Platform, and the Client Portal, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.&nbsp; Do not share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Websites, Apps, Client Portal, or systems that compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong><u>Updating Your Personal Information</u></strong></p>
<p>If any of the personal information provided to us changes, please let us know.&nbsp; For instance, if your email changes, you wish to cancel any request you have made of us, or if you become aware of inaccurate personal information about you, use our Contact Us details provided at the end of this Policy to update your information.&nbsp; You may also edit your account details if you have a user account through our Websites, the Apps, the Telehealth Platform, or the Client Portal.</p>
<p>Requests regarding any information provided to a health care provider, who is a TheraNest customer, should be directed directly to the health care provider.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Right of Access.</u>&nbsp; If required by law (e.g., under the GDPR), upon request, we will grant reasonable access to the personal information that we hold about you. An individual who seeks access under the GDPR to their personal information provided to a health care provider who is a TheraNest customer should send their request directly to the health care provider (TheraNest’s customer), who is the data controller. An individual who seeks to access or amend their “protected health information” under HIPAA should direct such inquiries to his or her health care provider (TheraNest’s customer).&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Accuracy.</u>&nbsp; Our goal is to keep your personal information accurate, current and complete.&nbsp; Please contact us if you believe your information is not accurate or changes.&nbsp; Requests regarding any information provided to a health care provider who is a TheraNest customer should be sent directly to the health care provider.</p>

<p><u>Right to Erasure and Deletion of Your Personal Information.</u> You may have a legal right (for instance, if you are located in the EU or EEA under the GDPR) to request that we delete your personal information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when, among other things, your personal information has been unlawfully processed.&nbsp; All deletion requests made to TheraNest should be sent to the address noted in the Contact Us section of this Policy.&nbsp; However, requests regarding any information provided to a health care provider who is a TheraNest customer should be sent directly to the health care provider.</p>
<p>We may decide to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate or that our continued storage of your personal information is contrary to our legal obligations or business objectives.&nbsp; When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active servers and databases and our Websites, the Apps, the Telehealth Platform, and the Client Portal, but it may remain in our archives when it is not practical or possible to delete it.&nbsp; We may also retain your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce any agreements.</p>
<p><u>Right to Withdraw Consent.</u>&nbsp; If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information, you have the right to fully or partially withdraw your consent.&nbsp; To withdraw your consent, please notify us using the information in the Contact Us section of this Policy and you may follow opt-out links on any marketing communications sent to you.&nbsp; However, requests regarding any information provided to a health care provider who is a TheraNest customer should be sent directly to the health care provider.</p>
<p>Once we have received notice that you have withdrawn your consent, in whole or in part, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented and have since withdrawn unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the processing of personal information for the provision of our services.</p>
<p><u>Right to Complain.</u> If you believe that your rights relating to your personal information have been violated, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the applicable enforcement authority, or to seek a remedy through the courts.&nbsp; You may also lodge a complaint with us by contacting us using the information provided in the Contact Us section of this Policy. You may also lodge a complaint directly with your health care provider regarding any information provided to the health care provider.</p>
<p><u>Online Tracking.</u>&nbsp; We do not currently recognize browser settings or signals of tracking preferences, which may include “Do Not Track” instructions.&nbsp; “Do Not Track” is a web browser setting that seeks to disable the tracking of individual users’ browsing activities.&nbsp; It is a standard that is currently under development. As it is not yet finalized, we adhere to the standards set out in this Policy and do not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals on our Websites, the Telehealth Platform, the Apps, the Client Portal, or on third-party websites or online services where we may collect information.</p>
<p><u>California Residents.</u> California residents may be entitled under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing.&nbsp; If you are a California resident and would like a copy of such notice, please submit a written request to us using the information in the “Contact Us” section of this Policy. Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act.

<p><u>Residents of the EU / EEA</u>.

When we transfer information to the United States or other countries, we do so for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp; We rely on recognized legal bases to lawfully conduct cross-border/international transfers of personal information outside of the EU and EEA, such as your express informed consent to do so (as noted above), when transfer is necessary for us to deliver services pursuant to an agreement between us and you, or when the transfer is subject to safeguards that assure the protection of your personal information, such as the European Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses.</p>
<p><strong><u>Links to Other Sites</u></strong></p>
<p>The Websites may contain links to, and media and other content from, third party websites.&nbsp; These links are to external websites and third parties with which we have no relationship.&nbsp; Because of the dynamic media capabilities of the Websites, it may not be clear to you which links are to the Websites and which are to external, third party websites.&nbsp; If you click on an embedded third-party link, you will be redirected away from the Websites to the external third-party website.&nbsp; You can check the URL to confirm that you have left our Websites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any personal information provided by you or automatically collected from you by a third party will be governed by that party’s privacy policy and terms of use.&nbsp; If you are unsure whether a website is controlled, affiliated, or managed by us, you should review the privacy policy and practices applicable to each linked website.</p>
<p><strong><u>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</u></strong></p>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), as well as other data privacy regulations, restrict the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from and about children on the internet. &nbsp;Our Websites, the Apps, the Client Portal, and the services we provide are not directed to children aged 18 or younger, nor is information knowingly collected from children under the age of 18.&nbsp; No one under the age of 18 may access, browse, or use the Websites, the Apps, or the Client Portal, or provide any information to or on the Websites, the Apps, or the Client Portal.&nbsp; If you are under 18, please do not use or provide any information on the Websites, the Apps, or the Client Portal.&nbsp; If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under the age of 18 without a parent's or legal guardian's consent, we will take steps to stop collecting that information and delete it.</p>
