<h1>Protecting Your Privacy on Theme Park Insider</h1>
Our editor reiterates the site's privacy policy, in light of recent news stories about Google's e-mail program and other questions about users' privacy online. <p>

</p><p><i>By <a href="/parks/profile.cfm?username=robert">Robert Niles</a> (posted via 144.142.21.5)</i></p>

Your privacy is important to you, and protecting that privacy is important to me, as a website publisher.<dl><dt>What information do we collect about you?</dt><dd>As an interactive community where readers provide the bulk of the site's coverage, Theme Park Insider collects and publishes information about its readers when they contribute information to the site. We publish the names and hometowns of people who submit comments to the site, and collect the IP address of everyone who submits a vote or comment. (An IP address is a series of numbers that identifies the computer through which you accessed the Internet. It is not the same as your e-mail address. And for users on dial-up accounts, the IP address we collect is that of the computer you dialed into at your ISP when you logged on.)<p></p></dd><dd>Only readers who register with the site may submit comments or vote on attractions. Theme Park Insider uses cookies to tell which readers are registered and who they are. (A "cookie" is a line of text in your browser's folder on your personal computer that includes that website's domain name and a unique user number. The cookie does not reveal any other information on your computer, including your name and passwords.)<p></p></dd><dd>If you do not want your name and hometown published on Theme Park Insider, or if you are under age 13, do not register with the site. Theme Park Insider reserves the right to republish any comments or articles submitted to it in any medium at any time.<p></p></dd><dt>No spam</dt><dd>We do not rent, lease, sell or reveal this user database to anyone. Nor do we spam our readers, or anyone else, with unsolicited commercial messages. The only e-mails we send to our readers are registration confirmations and an optional daily digest of new discussion topics. If you are interested in getting that daily digest, you can sign up on the <a href="/news/">News &amp; Trip Reports</a> page.<p></p></dd><dd>Registered users can send "blind" e-mails to other registered users via the site. We forward those messages without revealing the recipient's e-mail address. Also, those messages are always sent with the same subject line, allowing recipients to filter them.<p></p></dd><dt>No annoying ads</dt><dd>Theme Park Insider does not, has not and will not serve pop-up or pop-under ads on the site. Nor will we try to install "spyware" or other software on your computer. If you see pop-ups, pop-unders or graphical banner ads when you visit Theme Park Insider, your computer is likely infected with a spyware or adware program that it downloaded from another site. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/twc/privacy/spyware.mspx">Click here</a> to learn about spyware and how you can remove it from your computer.<p></p></dd><dd>We also strongly encourage you to use the free <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox browser</a> from Mozilla to help protect your computer from spyware and viruses that spread via the Internet Explorer browser. If you must use IE, please try the free <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google toolbar</a> to block pop-ups and set your IE security settings to medium or higher.<p></p></dd><dd>The only ads we present on ThemeParkInsider.com are text ads sold and served via <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/">Google's AdWords</a> program. Our travel agent partners, TravelNow and Lodging.com, may also run text and graphical banner ads on Theme Park Insider co-branded pages hosted on their sites.<p></p></dd><dt>Editorial integrity</dt><dd>Our editorial independence is important to us, so that's why we have an outside company (Google) handling all of our advertising. We don't know who spends what to advertise on ThemeParkInsider.com, so there can be no doubt that advertising does not affect our coverage of specific theme parks.<p></p></dd><dd>In addition, we ask all readers to abide by our <a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/ethics/">guidelines for writers</a> before submitting comments to the site.<p></p></dd><dt>Readers' support</dt><dd>As a community-driven website, we are only as successful as our readers allow us to be. That's why we invite our readers to link to <b>http://www.themeparkinsider.com</b>, or any other page on the site, and to patronize our <a href="http://www.travelnow.com/index.jsp?cid=53831">travel reservation pages</a> when making travel plans for any reason or occasion.<p></p></dd><dd>Also, please do <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/twc/privacy/spyware.mspx">clean your computer</a> of any spyware or adware programs, as those programs hijack weblinks and ad clicks, depriving this and other sites of revenue, which instead goes straight into those spammers' pockets.<p></p></dd><dd>Again, this site is a community. If you are uncomfortable participating as a public member of an online community, you are welcome to "lurk" and read the content of this site without adding any of your own. Otherwise, please be aware of the policies and practices described on this page before submitting any statements or content to the site.<p></p></dd><dt>Questions?</dt><dd>If you have any questions about Theme Park Insider or our practices, you can <a href="http://www.themeparkinsider.com/about_tpi/">read more about the site and its history</a>, e-mail me <a href="/parks/email.cfm">directly</a> or post a comment or question below.</dd></dl><br>Thank you for using Theme Park Insider, and thank you for your support of independent publishing online.<br>--Robert Niles, Editor<p>
