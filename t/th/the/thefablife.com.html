<p><strong>5.   <a id="one" name="five"></a> Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. </strong></p>
<p>VH1 may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from VH1, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.  Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for VH1.  The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.  Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.  Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for VH1’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<strong> </strong>be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from VH1.  Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.  <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, </strong><strong>VH1</strong><strong>, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
<p><strong>a.   Registration. </strong>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for VH1’s wireless marketing services.   Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of VH1 depending on the type of Promotion.  Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p><strong>i.          Single Opt-in Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.  The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to VH1 will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to VH1 to send text messages to him or her. VH1 will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.  The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from VH1 or by sending a text message to VH1 that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.</p>
<p><strong>ii.         Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.  The user must affirmatively consent to VH1’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by VH1) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.  The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.thefablife.com/terms-of-use-agreement/">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></strong> before the online registration process is completed. VH1 will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from VH1 to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of VH1’s wireless marketing service.  Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.  A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided that</span> VH1 may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while VH1 continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>iii.        Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.  VH1 will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from VH1 to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of VH1’s wireless marketing service.  Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.  A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that VH1 may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while VH1 continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>b.  Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from VH1 by the following procedure:</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by VH1 at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.  VH1 will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.  Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with VH1.  If the user unsubscribes from one or all of VH1 service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Termination of Wireless Services by </strong>VH1<strong>.</strong> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that VH1 may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.  VH1 may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>d.  Use of Information. </strong>VH1 will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use.  We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.  We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children or Ineligible Teenagers</span></strong><strong>.</strong> If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ineligible Teenagers</span>”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent</span>”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.

We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID.  If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.  The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. VH1 will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.  The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.  VH1 will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
<p><strong>8.   <a id="eight" name="two"></a> Protection of Information.</strong></p>
<p>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information.  However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.  We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site.  We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes.  We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phishing</span></strong><strong>.</strong> Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials.  “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.  <strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</strong> If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <strong><a href="mailto:privacy-admin@vh1.com">privacy-admin@vh1.com</a></strong>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
<p><strong>9.  <a id="nine" name="two"></a> Your California Privacy Rights. </strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">unsubscribe</span>”) or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes.  Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to the Privacy Administrator at <strong><a href="mailto:privacy-admin@vh1.com">privacy-admin@vh1.com</a></strong><strong>[insert link]</strong> or by postal mail to VH1.com, 1515 Broadway, New York, NY 10036,  Attn: Your California Privacy Rights, c/o Privacy Administrator.<br>
<strong>All requests must be labeled “Your California Privacy Rights” on the email subject line or envelope or post card.</strong> For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your California Privacy Rights”, include your name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail).  <strong>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. </strong>We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
<p><strong>10. <a id="one" name="ten"></a> </strong><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notice.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you.  Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting.  Notice of material changes will be posted on the Site’s homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion.  However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>11.  <a id="one" name="eleven"></a> Miscellaneous. </strong></p>
<p><strong>a.   Accuracy and Confidentiality. </strong>It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date.  <strong>We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete</strong> <strong>information or Personal Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information. </strong>We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for the activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site under your User ID (whether used by you or any others who use your User ID), unless and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party.   We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Further, if you use any of the Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any Information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public and please use caution when disclosing any Personal Information in the Communities, as you do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes. VH1 is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, that you disclose or receive through these venues and you should assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be available publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization.</p>

<p><strong>d.   Other:</strong> <strong>Please review </strong>our <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terms of Use Agreement</span></strong> which governs your use of the Site.  Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
