<p><u><a name="What Information"><strong>What Information Is Collected?</strong></a></u></p>

<p>We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites: non-personally identifiable information and personally identifiable information. &nbsp;Non-personally identifiable information does not individually identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your general location, demographics, use of the Sites and the Internet. &nbsp;Personally identifiable information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, your name, address, phone number, and email address, or non-personally identifiable information that has been linked to such personally identifiable information. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personally identifiable information to us. &nbsp;However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your personally identifiable information, including when you subscribe to our publications, newsletters, and other content; place an order; register for a Site or any part thereof; complete a survey or participate in market research; enter a contest; upload content; or when you seek employment at The Atlantic.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>When you interact with the Sites, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually (“non-personally identifiable information” or “non-PII”), such as demographic data; information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Sites, including IP address, general location information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information. We may also collect information about your use of the Sites, including your search terms and search results, and additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses. &nbsp;Our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our Sites. &nbsp;In addition to non-identifiable individual information, we may collect aggregate data regarding the use of the Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information From or Through Social Media Sites</strong></p>

<p>In addition, when you interact with any The Atlantic property page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or LinkedIn, we may collect the personally identifiable information that you make available to us on that page or account including your social media account ID. &nbsp;However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personally identifiable information that we are permitted to collect by those social media platforms. &nbsp;If you choose to link or login to your The Atlantic account with or through a social networking service, The Atlantic and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you view on the Sites, with that social network’s users.</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information</strong></p>

<p>We collect and store your device’s source IP address which may disclose the general location of your device at the time you access the Sites. &nbsp;Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data.</p>

<u><a id="How Do the Sites Use Cookies" name="How Do the Sites Use Cookies"><strong>How Do the Sites Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?</strong></a></u></p>

<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions.

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>This afternoon, in announcing her support for removing the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley asserted that killer Dylann Roof had “a sick and twisted view of the flag” which did not reflect “the people in our state who respect and in many ways revere it.” If the governor meant that very few of the flag’s supporters believe in mass murder, she is surely right. But on the question of whose view of the Confederate Flag is more twisted, she is almost certainly wrong.</p>

<p>Roof’s belief that black life had no purpose beyond subjugation is “sick and twisted” in the exact same manner as the beliefs of those who created the Confederate flag were “sick and twisted.” The Confederate flag is directly tied to the Confederate cause, and the Confederate cause was white supremacy. This claim is not the result of revisionism. It does not require reading between the lines. It is the plain meaning of the words of those who bore the Confederate flag across history. These words must never be forgotten. Over the next few months the word “heritage” will be repeatedly invoked. It would be derelict to not examine the exact contents of that heritage.</p>

            <p><b>1. Youngstown, U.S.A.</b></p>

<p>The end of work is still just a futuristic concept for most of the United States, but it is something like a moment in history for Youngstown, Ohio, one its residents can cite with precision: September 19, 1977.</p>

<p>For much of the 20th century, Youngstown’s steel mills delivered such great prosperity that the city was a model of the American dream, boasting a median income and a homeownership rate that were among the nation’s highest. But as manufacturing shifted abroad after World War &nbsp;II, Youngstown steel suffered, and on that gray September afternoon in 1977, Youngstown Sheet and Tube announced the shuttering of its Campbell Works mill. Within five years, the city lost 50,000 jobs and $1.3 billion in manufacturing wages. The effect was so severe that a term was coined to describe the fallout: <i>regional depression</i>.</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>MANILA, Philippines—The call came in the middle of a workday. My lawyer’s name flashed on the caller-ID screen, and there was no small talk when I picked up.</p>

<p>“I have the court decision,” she said.</p>

<p>She was literally holding my future in her hands, in the form of an annulment decision we had sought for four years. After opening the envelope, she rambled a bit, skimming the contents out loud to fill the dead air.</p>

<p>Then she paused.</p>

<p>“Petition approved. Congratulations!” she said. “You are now a free woman!”</p>

<p>I had finally gotten out of my long-dead marriage in the <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/02/13/the-global-catholic-population/#which-countries-have-the-most-catholics-now">devoutly Catholic Philippines</a>, the only country in the world (other than Vatican City) where divorce is not legal. Two people can voluntarily choose to love, honor, and remain faithful to each other, but in the Philippines it is pretty much only through death, or the torturously long process of annulment, that they can part.</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>Last week, I spent an illuminating hour with Yair Lapid, the former Israeli finance minister and now a leader of the opposition. Lapid, a voluble former television broadcaster, is the head of the Yesh Atid party—the name translates as, “There is a future.” This, of course, is a very Jewish thing to name a political party, for a large number of reasons I’ll let you figure out.</p>

<p>Lapid is a leader of the great mass of disillusioned centrists in Israeli politics. He could conceivably be prime minister one day, assuming Benjamin Netanyahu, in whose previous cabinet he served, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/bibi-deploys-the-southern-strategy/388096/">ever stops being prime minister</a>. Now functioning as a kind of shadow foreign minister, Lapid argues that Israel must seize the diplomatic initiative with the Palestinians if it is to continue existing as a Jewish-majority democracy, and he is proposing a regional summit somewhat along the lines of the earlier <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/01/200912764650608370.html">Arab Peace Initiative</a>. Lapid is not a left-winger—he has a particular sort of contempt for the Israeli left, born of the belief that leftists don’t recognize the nature of the region in which they live. But he is also for territorial compromise as a political and moral necessity, and he sees Netanyahu leading Israel inexorably toward the abyss.</p>

        <p class="dek">The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it.</p>

<p>Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, <i>The New York Times</i> published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>Once again, attackers have struck a tourist destination in Tunisia. <span>Two gunmen opened fire at a beach resort in the city of Sousse, </span>killing at least 27 people, <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1508894/tunisia-gunmen-attack-two-tourist-hotels">according to Sky News</a>. Early reports indicate most of the victims were British and German, <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/08cab43831154d5b8ccb476dd88a0127/latest-gunmen-kill-least-7-tunisia-beach-attack">the Associated Press reported</a>. According to the country’s interior ministry, one of the gunmen was killed, while another is still on the loose. It’s not yet known how many of those killed in the attack are foreigners, <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/08cab43831154d5b8ccb476dd88a0127/latest-gunmen-kill-least-7-tunisia-beach-attack">said the AP</a>, but “<span>during the holy month of Ramadan, those on the beach tend to be tourists.”</span></p>

<p>In March, nearly two dozen people—most of them tourists—were killed in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/03/19/in-tunisia-the-return-of-a-familiar-terror-target-foreign-tourists/">an attack at Tunisia’s Bardo Museum</a>. “<span>There's a clear logic at work when terrorists attack tourists,” wrote <em>The Washington Post</em>’s Adam Taylor. “Not only do these attacks spread terror internationally, they also have a negative effect on the economy of the local government.”</span></p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>As the Supreme Court term winds down, there is discussion whether the Court is in some way drifting to the left. That narrative may take on additional steam after Thursday’s decisions—<em>King v. Burwell, </em>negating a far-right challenge that might have destroyed the Affordable Care Act, and <em>Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, </em>an attempt by the state of Texas to radically scale back the scope of the federal Fair Housing Act.</p>

<p>Both challenges failed Thursday. But it would be a mistake to read <em>Inclusive Communities </em>as a “liberal” decision. Although four justices clearly wanted to radically cut back the Act, the majority—Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—signed on to an opinion narrowing it in crucial ways.</p>

        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>When the former NFL cheerleader Natalie Nirchi stopped menstruating at age 17, she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormone disorder affecting up to <a href="http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/PCOS/conditioninfo/Pages/risk.aspx">10 percent of women</a> of reproductive age. She didn’t initially show any of the physical symptoms, like excess hair growth, cystic acne, or obesity, but a blood test revealed that she had high levels of testosterone and an ultrasound showed cysts on her ovaries.</p>

<p>“My doctor mentioned that one day I might have trouble getting pregnant, but didn’t offer any other information about the disorder,” Nirichi said. Other than the absence of her period, PCOS did not significantly impact her life until college, when she began experiencing shooting pains in her pelvis, mood swings, and rapid weight gain despite a rigorous exercise routine.</p>

        <p class="dek">The justice’s famously whimsical approach to language has culminated in his frustrated declaration that, with the Court’s upholding of Obamacare, “Words have no meaning.”</p>
        
        <div class="excerpt">
            <p>“Words have meaning,” Antonin Scalia <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/">insisted</a> in 2013. “And their meaning doesn’t change.”</p>

<p>That second argument is something most linguists and lexicographers will, at minimum, quibble with. It is also, however, a<span> foundation of Scalia’s particular </span><a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2010_spr/scalia.htm">approach</a><span> to Constitutional interpretation. “I mean, the notion that the Constitution should simply, by decree of the Court, mean something that it didn’t mean when the people voted for it,” </span>the associate Supreme Court justice <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/">explained to <em>New York </em>magazine’s Jennifer Senior</a>—“frankly, you should ask the other side of the question! How did they <em>ever</em> get there?”</p>

<p>How indeed. Scalia is someone who loves words—not just as sources of literary performance (alliteration! puns! <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html">Kulturkampf</a>! <a href="http://e%20Defense%20of%20Marriage%20Act,%20calling%20it%20a%20%22legalistic%20argle-bargle,%22">argle-bargle</a>!), but also as sources of semantic stability. Words, Scalia believes, root us, collectively and epistemologically. So his famously saucy approach to language isn’t just about bringing literature to legalese, or about the schadenfreudic delights of sending reporters scrambling to dictionaries and thesauri when he issues a scathing dissent. It’s also a philosophical declaration about the unchanging nature of old truths, whatever document may enshrine them. <span>As the speechwriter Jeff Shesol </span><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scalias-word-games">wrote in the <em>New Yorker</em></a><span> last year, “His approach has always been to reach for a dictionary; find, in one edition or other, a definition that drives toward his predetermined decision; and express, eyes wide with disbelief, utter amazement that anyone could even think of seeing it any other way.”</span></p>

        <p class="dek"><span>When it comes to treating pain and chronic disease, many doctors are turning to treatments like acupuncture and meditation—but using them as part of a larger, integrative approach to health.&nbsp; </span></p>
        
        <div class="excerpt">
            <p class="dropcap">Back in the 1990s, the word “alternative” was a synonym for hip and forward-thinking. There was alternative music and alternative energy; there were even high-profile alternative presidential candidates like Ross Perot and Ralph Nader. That was the decade when doctors started to realize just how many Americans were using alternative medicine, starting with a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8418405">1993 paper</a> published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>. The paper reported that one in three Americans were using some kind of “unconventional therapy.” Only 28 percent of them were telling their primary-care doctors about it.</p>

<p><span>I was in high school at the time, and I knew about alternative medicine from my father, a family physician. He’d learned Transcendental Meditation back in medical school, and when I was a child, he began studying Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India. He never stopped practicing conventional medicine, but he added new things. At home, if I had a persistent sinus infection, he’d put me on antibiotics. But if I had a low-level cold, he’d advise me to drink ginger tea, inhale eucalyptus steam, and eat turmeric with honey. And the school I attended started and ended each day with a group meditation.</span></p>
