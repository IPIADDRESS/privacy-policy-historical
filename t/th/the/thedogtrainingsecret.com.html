            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;<strong>How We Use and Disclose the Information.</strong><br>

            legal rights or to defend against legal claims. We may also disclose your

            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;<strong>How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong><br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;We will not share the personal information you provide except as comports
            with this Privacy Policy. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell
            or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer
            information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains
            subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of
            course, the customer consents otherwise). At times, we may also share your
            personally identifiable information with third parties so that they may notify
            you of special offers, products and services that may be of interest to you. It
            is possible that we may rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personally

            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;Our business needs may change from time to time and we reserve the right
            to make changes to our Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current
            Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your
            account. We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them
            less protective of customer information collected in the past without the
            consent of affected customers.<br>

            technology, services, and/or content for the operation and maintenance of our
            Web site. Access to your personally identifiable information by these
            contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the
            contractor to perform its limited function for PremiumAstroloyg.com. We also
            contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors 1) protect
            the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this
            Privacy Policy, and 2) not use or disclose your personally identifiable
            information for any purpose other than providing us with products and services

            &nbsp;<strong>Cookies.</strong><br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use
            "cookies." Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to
            store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail
            address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to
            provide this information to us. However, once you choose to provide the
            personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data
            stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
            to your computer.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand
            how our site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For
            example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or

            &nbsp;Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons,
            which are also called single-pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users
            who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are
            not used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a
            technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web
            beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number,
            time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web
            beacon resides. Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there
            to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.<br>
