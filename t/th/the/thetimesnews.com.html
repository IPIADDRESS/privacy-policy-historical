        POLICY</h1>
      <p>This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for the Web sites (collectively,
        the "Service") made available by Freedom Communications, Inc. ("Freedom," "we" or "our"),
        the legal owner of the Service. <a href="ppsites.html">Click here</a> for
        a list of Freedom Web sites that are governed by this Privacy Policy.
        We respect your privacy and appreciate the confidence you have placed
        in the Service. We are committed to protecting your privacy and preserving
        your trust. Please carefully review this Privacy Policy to learn about
        how we collect, use, and protect any personal information you provide
        us and your choices for managing your personal information. This Privacy
        Policy is subject to the <a href="eula.html">User Agreement</a> posted
        on the Service.</p>
      <p><b>Opting Out Of Future Communications; Updating And Deleting Your Information</b></p>
      <p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If
        you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or wish
        to exclude your personal information from our direct marketing purposes,
        please feel free to contact us at: </p>

        or other personal information with us please contact us the same way.</p>
      <p><b>What Types Of Information Do We Collect?</b></p>
      <p>We collect information from our users at several different points on
        the Service. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information
        from you such as your name, address, phone number, household income,
        and e-mail address when you register, subscribe to one of our services,
        enter sweepstakes, contests or other promotions offered by or through
        the Service, and at other times. We also collect credit card information
        in connection with any purchase you make through the Service. In addition,
        we automatically collect non-personal information such as your browser
        type, operating system, IP address, and Service usage information, in
        order to, among other things, evaluate and improve the performance of
        the Service.</p>
      <p><b>How Do We Use The Information We Collect?</b></p>
      <p>We will not sell, share, or rent personal information to third parties,
        and we will not otherwise disclose personally identifiable information
        to third parties, without your explicit permission, except as disclosed
        in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>We collect and use information for internal purposes, such as:
      </p><ul>
        <li>enhancing your experience at the Service;</li>
        <li>performing administration and technical support for the Service;</li>
        <li>performing administration and technical support for the Service;</li>
        <li>enabling you to enter sweepstakes, contests and other promotions;</li>
        <li>creating aggregate information about demographics and usage patterns;</li>
        <li>inviting our promotional vendors and advertisers—with your
          explicit permission—to call to your attention special offers,
          products and services that may be of interest to you.</li>
        <li>enabling purchases of goods and services</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>We may use aggregate information to measure general Service usage patterns
	    and characteristics of our user base, and we may include such aggregate
	    information about our audience in reports to our commercial vendors. We
	    may also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, a certain percentage
	    of our users live in a certain area) without your permission in order to
	    describe our audience to existing and prospective advertisers or other third
	    parties. However, this aggregate information does not reference names, phone
	    numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personally identifiable information,
	    and it is not traceable to a specific recipient or user e-mail address.</p>
	  <p>We also may share personal information with companies affiliated with Freedom.
	    In the event that Freedom is merged, or in the event of a transfer of our
	    assets, we may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection
	    with such transaction. In the event of such a transfer, we will notify you
	    of the change of control of your personal information. You should also be
	    aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the
	    authority under certain circumstances to permit your personal information
	    to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.</p>
	  <p>From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other
	    persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to
	    confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. For example,
	    we may contract with service providers to provide certain services including
	    credit card processing, data management, promotional services, etc. We provide
	    our service providers with the information needed for them to perform these
	    services. Each service provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable
	    security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of your information
	    in order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
	    destruction, use, modification or disclosure.</p>
	  <p>Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personal information
	    when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact
	    or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury
	    to you, to Freedom or its affiliates, or to others. We may also disclose
	    your personal information when we believe the law requires it.</p>
	  <p><b>Registration</b></p>
	  <p>The general registration area can be found on the Service home page and
	    at other locations throughout the Service. To use or access certain features
	    of the Service, you may have to register or otherwise provide personal information.
	    The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect
	    not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access
	    certain content or features or participate in various areas of the Service.</p>
	  <p><b>Security</b></p>
	  <p>We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of personal
	    information that you share with us. However, no data transmission over the
	    Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
	    to protect personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant
	    the security of any information you transmit to or from the Service, and
	    you do so at your own risk.</p>
	  <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
	  <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your
	    computer or use other technology to improve your navigation of the Service.
	    A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your Web browser from
	    a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use
	    cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products and services to
	    suit your personal interests, estimate our audience size, track your status
	    in our sweepstakes, contests and promotions and/or analyze your visiting
	    patterns. The use of cookies is an industry standard; you will find them
	    at most major Web sites. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving
	    your preferences while you are using the Service. For this reason, we may
	    save passwords, credit card or other personal information in cookies. You
	    can generally set your Web browser not to accept cookies or to notify you
	    when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not
	    to accept it. If you set your Web browser not to accept cookies, it may
	    affect your ability to utilize all features on the Service.</p>
	  <p><b>Links To Third-Party Web Sites</b></p>
	  <p>The Service may contain links to Web sites operated and maintained by third
	    parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked
	    Web sites may be different from our Privacy Policy. You access such linked
	    Web sites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of
	    a linked Web site before disclosing any personal information on such site.</p>
	  <p><b>Discussion Board, Forums and Other User Generated Content</b></p>
	  <p>Our online chat areas, bulletin boards, other public forums and user-generated
	    content (i.e., photos, videos) can be a useful way for you to express yourself
	    to other online users. When you post messages or otherwise use these features,
	    the information that you provide (including personally identifiable information)
	    may be publicly available to, collected by, and used by third parties. We
	    are not responsible for the content of messages or images posted by users
	    or disclosures of personal information.</p>
	  <p><b>Children's Privacy Statement</b></p>
	  <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
	    under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received
	    personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, we
	    will delete such information from our records. Because we do not knowingly
	    collect any personally identifiable information from children under the
	    age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third
	    parties.</p>
	  <p><b>Policy Changes</b></p>
	  <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, we will
	    inform you by posting the changed Privacy Policy here. Those changes will
	    go into effect on the date posted in the notice. The new policy will apply
	    to all current and past users of the Service and will replace any prior
	    policies that are inconsistent.</p>
