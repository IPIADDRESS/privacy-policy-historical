            Thank you for visiting our educational games web site ("website") 
            located at "thesparklingminds.com". Through this website, we aim to provide 
            a safe, clean environment delivering educational content to children 
            (PreSchool - Grade IV) in the form of scientifically designed computer games. 
            We understand the importance of privacy concerns, especially in the Internet 
            environment and are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the 
            personal information of all users of this website. Our policy on the collection 
            and use of personal information and other information is outlined below.

            <br><br>
            <b>Information submitted by Users</b><br>
            In certain portions of our website, we may collect "personally identifiable 
            information" from users. "Personally identifiable information" includes, 
            for example, a person's name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, 
            credit card information, or any other information that can be used to 
            identify or contact an individual, whether online or offline. We may collect 
            this primarily for the following purposes:

            <ul>
                <li>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the website,</li>
                <li>To deliver services such as Scorecard tracking, Educational programs, 
                    Information, Newsletters or any other services you request or purchase</li>
                <li>To alert you on special offers, updated information and other new 
                    services from The Sparkling Minds or to forward promotional materials </li>
                <li>To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or 
                    Order Inquiry</li>
                <li>On all areas of our website, we seek to collect personally 
                    identifiable information only from adults. If you e-mail us, you are 
                    voluntarily releasing information to us. Your e-mail address will 
                    be used by us to respond to you. We will not use the information that 
                    can identify you for direct marketing purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <b>Information Collected Automatically</b><br>
            We also collect information by various technical means, without the user 
            submitting any information, in order to monitor the usage of our website 
            (such as the number of visitors to our website and the most popular games) 
            and to improve the user experience (such as saving your preferences). 
            The information collected in this way generally is not personally identifiable 
            information.<br><br>

            We also collect data automatically through "cookies" and "web logs" which are 
            commonly used on the Internet. A "cookie" is a piece of information that a web 
            site transfers to a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  As a user moves 
            across pages on our website, a cookie is used to tell us that it is the same user.  
            We also may use a cookie to keep track of your preferences.  You may set your 
            browser to accept or not accept cookies and you may delete any cookies that you 
            have received. However, should you decide to delete/disable any cookies we place 
            on your computer, some of our website features may not work as expected.<br><br>

            We also maintain web logs that record basic information about visitors to 
            our website such as the IP address for their computers and the type of browser 
            and operating system they use. An IP address is a number designated for your 
            computer by your Internet service provider to provide access to the Internet. 
            We may use your IP address to gather aggregate information on the use of the 
            website, but we will only be able to identify you individually if we link the 
            IP address to you as a particular user. 

            <br><br>
            <b>Additional Uses and Disclosures of Information</b><br>
            We may disclose and use the information we collect in connection with 
            investigations of illegal or unauthorized activity or in response to requests by 
            law enforcement agencies as well as government and other authorities. We may 
            disclose information to protect our rights or property or other users of the 
            website. In the event that 'The Sparkling Minds' is acquired by one or more 
            third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, 
            consolidation or liquidation, information we collect on our website may be 
            one of the transferred assets. We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding 
            user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our website and e-mails 
            to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or 
            demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.

            <br><br>
            <b>Security</b><br>
            We will protect the security and integrity of sensitive information collected on 
            our website. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot
