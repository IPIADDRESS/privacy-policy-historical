We also require contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us. Unfortunately, no security system, or system of transmitting data over the internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, while we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which information is transmitted between your computer and our servers, or any information provided to us or to any third party through or in connection with the website.

<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>Advertisements displayed to you on our site and elsewhere on the internet may be customized to your interests and preferences, based on information learned about you as you use our websites and the Web in general. If you do not want to participate in this, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="new">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> to opt-out.</p>
<p>Our site might include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites. These third-party websites and advertisers, or internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs) and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by our Advertising policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.</p>
<p>LYMI Inc. (d.b.a. The Reformation) might also display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although LYMI Inc. does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad (for example, users in the Northwestern United States who like designer jeans). Saved card details will never be shared with third parties and will only be used to process your order, using our payment partner's systems.</p>
