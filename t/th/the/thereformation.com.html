    <p><i>Business Transfers:</i>&nbsp;In the event that another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to Ref Services, your information may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and
      will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or

        <p>Send us an e-mail at <u><a href="mailto:DPO@thereformation.com">DPO@thereformation.com</a></u>, Contact us by mail at Reformation, 2263 E. Vernon Ave., Vernon, CA 90058, or unsubscribe from our marketing email communications at any time
          by unsubscribing or following the instructions contained within the email.</p>
        <p><u>Your California Privacy Rights.</u> California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their personal information is shared with third parties or affiliated companies for direct marketing purposes. If
          you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at:&nbsp;Email: <u><a href="mailto:love@thereformation.com">love@thereformation.com</a></u>. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in
          the subject field. We are not responsible for notices that are not properly labeled or sent, or do not have complete information.</p>
        <p class="q bold">7. Data security</p>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those
          employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        <p class="q bold">8. Data retention</p>
        <p>Withdraw consent at any time&nbsp;where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may
          not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
        <p><b>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please&nbsp;contact us.</b></p>
        <p><i>No fee usually required. </i>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
          Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
        <p><i>What we may need from you.</i> We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
        <p><i>Time limit to respond.</i> We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we
          will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
        <p class="q bold">9. Your legal rights</p>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: </p>
        <p>Request access&nbsp;to your personal data (commonly known as a 'Data Subject Access Request'). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. </p>
        <p>Request correction&nbsp;of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
        <p>Request erasure&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data
          where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however,
          that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
        <p>Object to processing&nbsp;of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
          feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate
          grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
        <p>Request restriction of processing&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the
          data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but
          we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
        <p>Request the transfer&nbsp;of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies
          to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
        <p class="q bold">10. Children's privacy</p>
        <p>Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct Ref Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of 13. If Ref learns that a child under the age of thirteen has provided
          personally identifiable information through Ref Services, we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our files.</p>
        <p class="q bold">11. Security of information</p>
        <p>We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. &nbsp;Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant
          the security of any information you transmit to us. You use Ref Services and provide us with your information at your own risk. &nbsp;If we share information with a third party, as detailed in this privacy policy, we shall use all reasonable
          efforts to ensure that they keep the information secure and only use the information consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p class="q bold">12. Other sites</p>
        <p>Ref Services may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. This includes links from service providers, fulfillment companies, advertisers, sponsors, or other business partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a
          co-branding agreement. We are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or practices. These other web sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect data or
          solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any site which appears or claims that it is one of Ref Services (including those linked to
          through an email or social networking page). </p>
        <p class="q bold">13. Consent to processing and international transfers</p>
        <p>We may transfer your personal data internally within Ref and other external third parties, which may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). </p>
            <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data to external third parties based outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of
      personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
    <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European
      Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
    <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection
    to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Please&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
    <p class="q bold">14. Changes</p>
    <p>Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree or consent to these updates or changes, do not continue to use
      Ref Services. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will provide appropriate notice to you.</p>
    <p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, there may be specific campaigns or promotions which will be governed by additional privacy terms or policies. We encourage you to read these additional terms or policies before participating in any such
      campaigns or promotions as you will be required to comply with them if you participate. Any additional privacy terms or policies will be made prominently available to you. </p>
