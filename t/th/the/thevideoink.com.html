<p><b>How Do We Use This Information?</b></p>
<p>We use the Information we obtain from or concerning you or your computer or device to provide the Services, fulfill your requests, improve the Services, personalize and tailor your experience on our website, operate our business, and understand how users are engaging with our Services.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use Information from or concerning you or your computer or device to facilitate the delivery of content or advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you about new or existing products and services or special offers. For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and services to the email address associated with your account.</p>
<p><b>Our Use of Cookies</b></p>
<p>VideoInk may place “cookies” on your computer or device that may contain anonymous Information that is associated with you. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize users, and are typically placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain (here, VideoInk) that issued the cookie to you or that, in some cases, can be read by a third party domain.</p>
<p>Our cookies may record Information about your use of VideoInk so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you, including for one or more of the following purposes: to help identify visitors; assess usage patterns; identify preferences; control the display of ads; diagnose problems with our servers; gather demographic information; analyze trends and usage patterns; conduct research; deliver editorial content; record registration and personalized information; and otherwise administer the Services.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to have VideoInk place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse cookies before accessing the Services. VideoInk is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Services that depend on cookies.</p>
<p><b>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</b></p>
<p>VideoInk may disclose Information (including Personally Identifying Information) from or concerning you or your computer or device to third parties in the circumstances described below. By visiting, accessing, attending or using the Services, you consent to the disclosure of your Information to certain categories of third parties in the manner described below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the policies or practices of any of these third parties.</p>
<p><b><i>Service Providers:&nbsp; </i></b>VideoInk relies on third party vendors and service providers to provide support and assistance for its products, services and events (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Providers</span>”), and we may disclose your Information (including Personally Identifying Information) to these Service Providers to the extent necessary to support our products, services or events, or as otherwise set forth below and subject to their agreement not to disclose it to others. Such Service Providers may include third party payment processors who process financial payments for certain Services on our behalf; third parties that process registration for VideoInk webinars, events and programs (and companies that sponsor or underwrite portions of such webinars, events and programs); <b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Third Party Websites:&nbsp; </i></b>VideoInk may offer the ability to share VideoInk content on Third Party Websites, including social networking and blogging services. When you elect to share content and information with others on Third Party Websites, VideoInk may transmit your Information to such Third Party Websites. Your decision to share information in this manner is completely voluntary. <b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Advertisers and Analytics Services:&nbsp; </i></b>VideoInk uses third party advertisers, including ad networks, to provide advertising on its websites. In addition, VideoInk uses third party analytics products to obtain information about how users are using and interacting with the Services. These third parties may receive Information (including Personally Identifying Information) from VideoInk as discussed in greater detail under “Security and Protection of Personally Identifying Information” below.<b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Law Enforcement/Legal Process:&nbsp; </i></b>We may disclose your Information (including Personally Identifying Information) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with any law, regulation or legal request; enforce, apply, or investigate breaches of our Terms of Service and other agreements; respond to public requests; or protect the rights, property, user experience or safety of VideoInk, our employees, our users, or others. This can include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Comments and Public Posts:&nbsp; </i></b>If you post comments or other Information to the Services, that Information can be viewed, collected and used by others, including other users, search engines, advertisers, third party applications developers, and anyone with access to the Services. VideoInk has no control over the use, collection or disclosure of any Information that you post publicly to the Services.<b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Change of Control:&nbsp; </i></b>If VideoInk, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by another company or party, user Information will be one of the assets transferred or acquired by the purchaser. <b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Third-Party Advertisers:&nbsp; </i></b>VideoInk may allow third party advertising serving companies, including ad networks (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisers</span>”), to display advertisements or provide other advertising services on the Services. These third party Advertisers may use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record demographic and other Information about you, including your activities on or off the Services. <b><i></i></b></p>
<p>Advertisers may use the information collected to display advertisements that are tailored to your interests or background and/or associate such information with your subsequent visits, purchases or other activities on other websites. Advertisers may also share this information with their clients or other third parties.</p>
<p><b><i>Analytics Providers:&nbsp; </i></b>In addition, VideoInk may use third party analytics providers and products to obtain, compile and analyze Information (that may include Personally Identifying Information) about how users are using and interacting with the Services. VideoInk may provide Information (including Personally Identifying Information) to these analytics providers for the purpose of obtaining such analytics. These analytics providers may use tracking techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect or compile this information. <b><i>VideoInk assumes no responsibility for the technologies, tools or practices of its Advertisers or analytics providers</i></b><i>.</i></p>
<p><b>Security and Protection of Personally Identifying Information</b></p>
<p>We have implemented reasonable security measures and practices in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your Personally Identifying Information (other than Personally Identifying Information that you have elected to disclose to others). However, no security system is impenetrable. It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access information you provide to the Services. VideoInk cannot guarantee the security of your Personally Identifying Information, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to the Services. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password(s) and computer or device, and to log off when using any shared computer.</p>
<p><b>Email or Text Message Communications</b></p>
<p>We may contact you by e-mail, text message or other equivalent electronic communications if you register for events, webinars or other content or otherwise access the Services.</p>
<p><b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>VideoInk retains the discretion to amend or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by placing a special notice on our website.</p>
