INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p><p>There are three general categories of information we collect.</p><p><strong>1.1 Information You Give to Us.</strong></p><p>1.1.1 Information that is necessary for the use of the Storefront Platform.</p><p>We ask for and collect certain personal information about you when you use the Storefront Platform.

While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, it may affect your ability to log in to your account and use the Site. The Storefront Platform currently does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.</li></ul><p><strong>1.3 Information We Collect from Third Parties.</strong></p><p>Storefront may collect information, including personal information, that others provide about you when they use the Storefront Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Storefront Platform and the Payment Services.

Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such provider.</p><p>Please note that you may, at any time ask Storefront to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to&nbsp;privacy@thestorefront.com.</p><p><strong>3.8 Business Transfers.</strong></p><p>If Storefront is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). </p><p><strong>3.9 Aggregated Data.</strong></p><p>We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other anonymized information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p><p><strong>4.

Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:</p><ul><li>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a Storefront Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Storefront Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Storefront Account in the future.</li><li>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Storefront may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.</li><li>Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Storefront Platform, even after your Storefront Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</li><li>Because we maintain the Storefront Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</li></ul><p><strong>6.5 Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.</strong></p><p>Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Storefront you may withdraw your consent at any time by sending a communication to Storefront specifying which consent you are withdrawing. &nbsp;This may necessarily result in the closure of your account.  Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Storefront override your own.</p><p><strong>6.6 Objection to Processing.</strong></p><p>In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Storefront not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing Storefront will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p><p>Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask Storefront to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to privacy@thestorefront.com.</p><p><strong>6.7 Lodging Complaints.</strong></p><p>You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by Storefront before the competent data protection authorities. If you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to file a complaint with Storefront’s lead supervisory authority, National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) (CNIL). </p><p><strong>7. OPERATING GLOBALLY</strong></p><p>To facilitate our global operations Storefront may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies or with service providers based in Europe, India, Asia Pacific and North America. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your Country of Residence. For example, information collected within the EEA may be transferred, stored, and processed outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p><p>If your information is shared with corporate affiliates or third party service providers outside the EEA, we have – prior to sharing your information with such corporate affiliate or third party service provider – established the necessary means to ensure an adequate level of data protection. This may be an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective non-EEA country or an agreement on the basis of the EU Model Clauses (a set of clauses issued by the European Commission). We will provide further information on the means to ensure an adequate level of data protection on request.</p><p><strong>7.1 California &amp; Vermont Residents.</strong></p><p>Storefront will not share information it collects about you with its affiliates or third parties (both financial and non-financial), except as required or permitted by your state’s law.</p><p><strong>7.2 California Privacy Rights.</strong></p><p>California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. See the “Contact” section for where to send such requests. Storefront does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent.</p><p><strong>8. SECURITY</strong></p><p>We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use to protect your information are firewalls and data encryption, and information access controls. If you know or have reason to believe that your Storefront Account credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Storefront Account, please contact us following the instructions in the Contact Us section below.</p><p><strong>9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p><p>Storefront reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Storefront Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you may cancel your Account. If you do not cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access to or use of the Storefront Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>10. CONTACT US</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or Storefront’s information handling practices, please email us at privacy@thestorefront.com.</p></div></div></div><script src="https://d2kity9bboyw3j.cloudfront.net/assets/scripts/utilities-f1a92503-b1.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script
