          <p><strong>Introduction </strong><br>
          	We are committed to protecting your privacy and the
            privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy (this
            <u>“Policy”</u>) describes how our Services handle and secure information they
            collect. This Privacy Policy is part of, and incorporated into, the
            <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> for our Services. If you have entered into a user agreement
            for one of our Services (your <u>“User Agreement”</u>), it will supplement and
            amend the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Because the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> and your User Agreement
            include subjects that may not be covered in this Policy, and may narrow
            ormodify the scope of our use of information under this Policy, please
          review them carefully. </p>
          <p><strong>Information Collected by our Services</strong>
          <br>
          <u>Information You Submit:</u> When you use our Services, you can (depending on the Service
          you use) submit information by: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Typing-in data (such as when you register for our Services, or type a
              message to send to us, or type a search request, or complete a form);
            </li>
            <li>Uploading a document, image or other data file; or
            </li>
            <li>Authorizing us to retrieve and import information from another user
              or other third party on your behalf.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <u>Engagement Tools and Data:</u> Our Services also gather information whenever
            you visit, log in or otherwise interact with them. As with other
            websites and interactive services, whenever you interact with our
            Services, your computer, mobile phone or tablet (a <u>“Device”</u>) and its
            software may transmit a “request” to us. That request includes
            non-personal information received from your Device (and its software)
            necessary for us to identify and appropriately route the information
            your Device is requesting. These “requests” and “replies” are the
            backbone of all websites and Internet services. Therefore, whenever you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visit and navigate through our Services
            </li>
            <li>Click on a link
            </li>
            <li>Open a webpage or web form
            </li>
            <li>Open a web-enabled email sent by us
            </li>
            <li>Send a message via our interactive chat or instant message feature
              or support request
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise take an action or interact with elements of our Services
            or its pages, content or features </li>
            </ul>
          In addition to managing the appropriate routing of information, we use so-called “cookies,” 			          “web
              beacons,” “server logs” and other <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> to enhance the
              quality of the service and content you receive. For example, we use <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> to:
<ul>
            <li>Save user preferences;
            </li>
            <li>Preserve session settings and activity;
            </li>
            <li>Help authenticate users;
            </li>
            <li>Allow users to auto-fill sign-in pages of websites they frequently
              visit;
            </li>
            <li>Tailor the delivery of ads and other content; and
            </li>
            <li>Analyze the performance of our Services and its various features and
              content.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Therefore, even if you do not register with us or submit any personal
            information on our Services, our <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> automatically receive
            information about your Device and the software running on it. We call
          such data “<u>Engagement Data</u>.” </p>
          <p>
            Engagement Data often includes elements such as the date and time a
            “request” is made, the model of the Device making the “request,” the
            type and version of operating system running on a Device (e.g., Mac OS
            or Microsoft Windows), the browser making the request (e.g., Internet
            Explorer, Chrome, Firefox or Safari), routing information, IP address,
            the Device’s geographic location, search terms a user enters, what URL a
            Device most recently visited, and, if a mobile application is used, an
            anonymous unique number. Engagement Data generally does not personally
            identify a Device’s user. However, it can be combined with personal
            information. If so, we treat such combined information the same way we
            treat personal information. Additionally, in the event that our
            Engagement Tools collect data elements that contain personal
          information, we treat those data elements as personal information. </p>
          <p>You
            have the ability to control how certain <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> operate by
            modifying the settings on your Device or its software. Most browsers,
            for example, allow you to refuse accepting cookies, and many mobile
            Devices allow you to disable the sending of location information. In
            some cases, doing these things could diminish the performance of our
            Services or render them inoperable. To learn more about <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> and how we use Engagement Data please see our <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> page and
            the section below entitled “How Information is used.” </p>
          <p>
            <u>Third Party Tools</u>: We work with certain third parties who deploy their
            own engagement tools on our Services. In some instances they do so
            exclusively on our behalf. In other instances, they may retain and use
            the data they collect pursuant to publicly available privacy policies.
            Companies providing online advertising services or analytics frequently
            deploy these Third Party Tools, but they may be deployed in other
            contexts as well, such as social media plug-ins. We treat personal and
            non-personal information that we receive from these <a href="/third-party-tools">Third Party Tools</a> the same way we treat personal and non-personal information that we
            directly collect from our Services. We, however, do not control how
            these third parties manage the information they gather. Please see our
          <a href="/third-party-tools">Third Party Tools</a> for more information. </p>
          <p><u>Personal and Non-Personal
            Information</u>: Information you submit to us that identifies you or can be
            used to contact you (e.g., email or mailing address) is your “<u>personal
            information</u>.” This includes identifiers that a governmental authority,
            financial institution or insurance carrier may use to uniquely identify
            you (e.g., a Social Security, credit card or ACH account number). When
            we combine non-personal information with personal information, or
            non-personal information with other non-personal information in a way
            that renders the combined information personal information, we treat
            that combined information the same way we treat personal information.
            When we combine personal information with information from third party
            sources, we also treat that combined information the same way we treat
          personal information. </p>
          <strong>How Information is Used</strong>
            <br>We use personal and non-personal information (including Engagement Data)
            for the following purposes:<p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Operating, maintaining, managing and administering our Services,
              including processing registrations and payments, and providing customer
              support;</li>
            <li>Responding to questions and communications, which we retain in the
              ordinary course of business;</li>
            <li>Administrative announcements about features, functionality, terms or
              other aspects of our Services; and, if applicable, informing you about
              offers for services or products we believe may be of interest (for
              further information, see also “Service Emails and other Communications”
              below);</li>
            <li>Safeguarding and protecting our Services, the information they
              safeguard, the rights of third parties and in response to legal process,
              in each case, as more fully described below in “The Importance of
              Protecting our Services and the Information they Safeguard;” and</li>
            <li>Any other purpose described in this Policy or your User
              Agreement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We use non-personal information for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Auditing, research, measurement and analysis in order to maintain,
              administer, enhance and protect our Services, including analyzing usage
              trends and patterns and measuring the effectiveness of content,
              advertising, features or services;</li>
            <li>Creating new features and services;</li>
            <li>Contextual and cookie-based automated content delivery, such as
              tailored ads or search results;</li>
            <li>Health and medical research; public health and service activities;
              healthcare- and medical-related services; and
            </li>
            <li>Other purposes described in this Policy or your User Agreement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may also use non-personal information to prepare aggregate reports for
            current or future advertisers, sponsors or other partners to show trends
            about the general use of our Services. Such reports may include age,
            gender, geographic, demographic or other general user information, but
            do not include personal information.
          </p>
          <u>Consents and Authorizations:</u><p>
            From time to time, we may request your consent or authorization (your
            “<u>consent</u>”) in connection with the use or sharing of your information. In
            some instances, this will be because your User Agreement, this Policy or
            applicable law or regulations requires us to obtain such consent. In
            other instances, such consent will be for informational purposes. In the
            latter case, the request to obtain your consent should not be
            interpreted as narrowing the scope or applicability of your User
            Agreement or this Policy – by entering into your User Agreement or using
            the applicable Services, you have accepted and agreed to our information
            handling practices in the manner described in your User Agreement and
            this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where you consent or “opt-in” to the use or sharing of your
            personal information in a manner that is not otherwise provided for in
            your User Agreement or this Policy, unless otherwise explicitly stated
            in such consent, you will have the ability to rescind your consent and
            “opt-out” of our use or sharing of such information in the future. In
            that event, we will refrain from our use or sharing of such information,
            but we may not be able to require the removal of such information from
            the databases of the recipients with whom such information has been
          shared. </p>
          <p><strong>How our Services Allow Users to Share Information: </strong><br>
          <strong><i>One-on-One
            Communications:</i></strong> Our Services can be used to facilitate one-on-one
            communications between users. Examples include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requesting an appointment with a healthcare provider;</li>
            <li>Sending an appointment or other reminder to another user.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In any one-on-one communication, users are sending information to one
            another. Depending on the message, this could include contact and other
            personal information. See also “Service Emails and other Communication”
            below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><i>Surveys and Ratings:</i></strong> From time to time we ask users to submit surveys or
            ratings to assist us in improving services. The content of such surveys
            or ratings, therefore, should be presumed public. When we make such
            survey and ratings requests, we let users know how their responses will
            be used. We strongly advise users to exercise care in selecting what
            information they share in a survey or similar communication, and
            strongly recommend against sharing any personal or other sensitive
            information that could directly or indirectly be traced to any
            individual, including you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em><strong>Records:</strong></em> Our Services allow users to store personal and health
            information (“<u>Records</u>”), including Records that identify other
            individuals, including other users. Our Services permit users to share
            all or portions of these Records at their discretion. You should be
            aware that this Policy covers only the information you submit through
            our Services. If you contact or exchange information with another user,
            either in person or through another means outside of our Services, such
          activity is not covered by this Policy. </p>
          <p>
            <u>What Other Users Do with Information You Share with Them</u>: Because our
            Services enable users to share information you share with them, you
            should take care in selecting with whom you share your Records and other
            information. Although our Services process such transmissions, we cannot
            take responsibility for the actions of other users or persons with whom
            you share your Records and other information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Confidentiality of Health Information</u>: Some of our users – such as
            healthcare providers – are subject to laws and regulations governing the
            use and disclosure of health information they create or receive.
            Included among them is the Health Insurance Portability and
            Accountability Act of 1996 (“<u>HIPAA</u>”), the Health Information Technology
            for Economic and Clinical Health of 2009 (“<u>HITECH</u>”), and the regulations
            adopted thereunder. When we store, process or transmit “individually
            identifiable health information” (as such term is defined by HIPAA) on
            behalf of a health care provider who has entered a Healthcare Provider
            User Agreement, we do so as its “business associate” (as also defined by
            HIPAA). Under this agreement, we are prohibited from, among other
            things, using individually identifiable health information in a manner
            that the provider itself may not. We are also required to, among other
            things, apply reasonable and appropriate measures to safeguard the
            confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable
            health information we store and process on behalf of such providers. To
            see our <a href="/healthcare-provider-user-agreement">Healthcare Provider User Agreement</a>, and to specifically review
            our business associate obligations, please review Sections 4.1.8 and 9
            of that agreement. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing
            the use and information of certain personal and health information,
            including HIPAA, when we operate as a business associate of a healthcare
          provider. </p>
          <p>
            <u>Service Emails and other Communications</u>: Our Services may allow users to
            communicate with others through our in-product messaging services,
            Service-branded emails, SMS and other electronic communication channels.
            Communications that are sent by or on behalf of a user are indicated as
            being “From” that user. Communications that are sent by us are indicated
            as being from an authorized representative of the company (such as a
            support specialist) assigned to assist you. Either type of
            communications may be “real time” communications or communications
            triggered automatically upon the occurrence of certain events or dates –
            such as a repeated sign-in failure, an appointment reminder and the
          like. </p>
          <p>Email communications received from users and our administrative
            announcements are often transactional or relationship messages, such as
            appointment requests, reminders and cancellations and other treatment or
            Service notificationslabel-contact-2.png. You may not be able to opt out of receiving
            certain messages, although our Services may provide a means to modify
            the frequency of receiving them. In cases in which we believe user
            emails are not primarily transactional or relationship messages, it will
            include the capability to opt-out of receiving further e-mails. If you
            sign-up to receive marketing or informational announcements from us,
          such emails will include capability to opt-out if so desired. </p>
          <p>Our
            Services may deploy <a href="/engagement-tools">Engagement Tools</a> (such as “cookies,” “web beacons”
            and “server logs”) on outbound emails to users and others to collect

          <ul>
            <li>When you choose to share such information through our Services.
              Under certain circumstances this may require a specialized consent
              before our Services complete certain such transmissions;</li>
            <li>When you are otherwise notified at the time we collect such
              information or we otherwise have your express consent;</li>
            <li>When an account administrator has issued your account, your account
              administrator will have access to your account information, including
              your personal information. Your account administrator may: (i) receive
              and retain your account information, (ii) change your account password,
              (iii) restrict your ability to submit, delete or edit information; (iv)
              suspend or terminate your account access, or (v) access or retain
              information you submit or otherwise stored as part of your account for
              any purposes required or permitted under applicable law;</li>
            <li>When we share such information with our current and future

            <li>When we share such information with trusted service providers
              operating on our behalf consistent with the terms of this Policy and
              your User Agreement. Such service providers shall be bound by
              appropriate confidentiality and security obligations, which may include,
              as applicable, business associate contract obligations. We will not
              sell, rent or trade your personal information with any third parties for
              their promotional or marketing purposes;</li>
            <li>When we protect our Services, the information they safeguard, the
              rights of third parties and in response to legal process, as more fully
              described below in “The Importance of Protecting our Services and the
              Information they Safeguard;”</li>
            <li>In connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange,
              reorganization or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or
              otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the services
              to which this Privacy applies. If such a transaction occurs, the
              acquiring company’s use of your personal information will remain subject
              to this Policy; and</li>
            <li>Any other purposes described in this Policy or your User

          </ul>
          <p>
            It is important for you to understand that other users who submit to, or
            receive from, our Services personal information about you, may share
            that information with other persons, even without separately notifying
            you or seeking your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Importance of Protecting our Services and the Information they
          Safeguard </strong>
          <br>Many of our Services are protected by technical measures
            intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility
            of sensitive information our users store and share on our Services.
            Further, certain regulations require us to investigate potential or
            suspected threats on our Services or the confidentiality, integrity or
            availability of the information they safeguard. Accordingly, we may
            preserve, use and disclose information – including personal and
            non-personal information – when we have a good faith belief it is
            necessary or advisable to: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Detect, prevent and address potential or suspected: threats on our
              Services or the confidentiality, integrity or availability of any
              information they house; fraud and other illegal activity; or violations
              of our User Agreements or Terms of Use; and</li>
            <li>To protect you, third parties and ourselves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may also preserve, use and disclose such information in response to a
            search warrant, court order, subpoena, judicial proceeding or other
            legal process if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to
            do so. Such legal process may prohibit us from notifying the users or
            other individuals or entities identified by such information or take
            such other actions, as would otherwise be a violation of your User
            Agreement or this Policy. When we preserve information pursuant to this
            section, it may be for extended periods of time, as we in good faith
            believe are necessary or appropriate under the circumstances, and may
            include the preservation of information from accounts that have been
            disabled.
          </p>
          <strong>Security</strong>
          <p>
            The security of our Services and the information they store, process and
            transmit is a top priority. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain
            data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the information we
            collect, we deploy a wide range of technical, physical and
            administrative safeguards, including: Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
            encryption, firewalls, system alerts and other information system
            security technologies; housing health data in secure facilities that
            restrict physical and network access; and regular evaluation and
            enhancement of our information technology systems, facilities, and
            information collection, storage and processing practices. Under our
            Healthcare Provider User Agreement and applicable law, we are required
            to apply reasonable and appropriate measures to safeguard the
            confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable
            health information (as such term is defined by HIPAA) residing on and
            processed by our Services. It is important to remember, however, that no
            system can guarantee 100% security at all times. Accordingly, we cannot
            guarantee the security of information stored on or transmitted to or
            from our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Steps You Can Take</u>: If we learn of a security vulnerability or risk, we
            may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective measures
            you may take. There are, however, some precautions that you can
            proactively take to improve your system security and reduce the
            likelihood of unintended disclosure of personal information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Install malware detection programs that regularly scan your system
              and incoming traffic for malicious code – such as computer viruses,
              worms, Trojan Horses and spyware. Because viruses and malware are
              continuously created and modified, regular malware protection software
              typically requires frequent updates.</li>
            <li>Use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to your Device.</li>
            <li>Because malware often targets vulnerabilities in existing operating
              systems, browsers, plug-ins and other programs, software vendors
              frequently update their products with security patches to guard against
              known or commonly exploited vulnerabilities. Vendors often try to alert
              their users and recommend immediate installation of these security
              patches.</li>
            <li>Use a strong password using a combination of letters and numbers
              that are not easily guessed. Do not share your password with
              others.</li>
            <li>If you use a shared Device, always close all active programs and log
              out before leaving it unattended.</li>
            <li>Avoid using a public wireless network, if possible. If you do use a
              public network, use the most restrictive wireless network settings on
              your Device.</li>
            <li>If you use file-sharing programs, be sure to restrict all other
              folders or directories to “no share.”</li>
            <li>Be very cautious with any email requesting you to share personal
              information. On websites, look for the lock symbol on or near your
              browser’s address bar which signifies a secure website before supplying
              personal information.</li>
            <li>When participating in one of our communities, surveys or other open
              communication platforms, exercise care in selecting what information you
              share, particularly personal or health information.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Children less than 13 years of age</strong>
          <br>
            Our Services are not intended for or designed to attract children under
            the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
            such children. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal
            information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that
            information as soon as practicable. If you become aware that your child
            has provided us with personal information without your consent, please
            contact us immediately at the contact information below. Should this
            policy change, we would comply with the Children’s Online Privacy
            Protection Act, which requires us to notify and obtain consent from a
            parent or guardian before we collect, use and disclose the personal
            information of children who are under 13 years of age. Without limiting
            the generality of the foregoing, our Services do allow users above the
            age of 18 years old – such as healthcare providers, parents and
            guardians – to submit personal information about others, including
            minors. Such users assume full responsibility over their submission, use
            and transmission of such information.
          <p>
          <strong>United States Only</strong>
          <br>
            Access to our Services is administered in the United States (“US”) and is
            intended for users in the US. You may not use our Services in any
            jurisdiction where offering, accessing or using our Services would be
            illegal or unlawful. If you are located outside of the United States,
            please note that the information you submit to us will be transferred to
            the US. By using our Services, you consent to this transfer. You also
            consent to the transfer to and processing of any personal information by
            us or other parties described in the section “Sharing of Information”
            above, whether located in the US or any other countries, for the
            purposes described in this Policy, or for any other specific purposes to
            which you consent. If you are located in a country other than the US,
            you should note that, at present, the laws of the US and certain other
            countries have not been approved by the European Commission or privacy
            authorities in certain other countries as providing “adequate
            protection” for personal information within the meaning of the European
            Union Data Protection Directive or applicable laws of other countries.
          </p>
          <strong>Third Party Services</strong>
          <br>
            This Policy applies only to our Services. It does not apply to services
            offered by third parties, including websites and other online services
            that our Services may display links to or advertisements for. When you
            click on such links or advertisements, you will be visiting websites or
            interactive services operated by third parties, who have their own
            information collection practices and may also collect information
            through the use of tracking tools, such as cookies, web beacons, server
            logs and the like. When you click on or interact with an ad appearing in
            our Services, the advertiser or sponsor may infer that you meet
            targeting criteria that they may have used in connection with the
            sponsoring such ad. This may lead to similar ads being targeted to you
            on our Services or elsewhere. We do not have control over how any third
            party gathers or uses information, so you should review their privacy
            policies to learn of their information gathering and handling practices.
          <p>
          <strong>Changes to this Policy</strong>
          <br>
            We work hard to continuously improve and enhance our Services. Some of
            these improvements and enhancements may result in changes to this
            Policy. We will post such changes along with their effective date on
            this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more
            prominent notice. Because our Policy can change at any time, we
            encourage you to reread it periodically to see if there have been any
            changes that affect you. If you disagree with any changes to this Policy
            and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Policy,
            you will need to deactivate your account before the new Policy becomes
            effective. Your use of our Services following any such change
            constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about
            you through our Services after the revised Policy is posted will be
            subject to the terms of the revised Policy.
          </p><p>
          <strong>
            Viewing, Updating and Deactivating Information
          </strong>
          <br>
            Our Services aim to provide you with access to the personal information
            you submit and the means to update it. Your information can be viewed,
            updated or deactivated by logging into our Services or contacting us.
            Under certain circumstances, we may ask you to verify your identity
            before your request is processed. This will be done free of charge
            except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We may reject
            requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate
            technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally
            changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be
            extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
            residing on backup tapes).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you desire to deactivate your account please contact us using the
            contact information below. Upon your request, your account will be
            deactivated and your personal information and Records will be securely
            archived. We retain archived information for a period of five years (or
            longer if required by law) as necessary to comply with legal
            obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements and other
            authorized uses under this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that, unless you are an administrator who has administrative
            rights over another user’s account pursuant to a Healthcare Provider
            User Agreement, you are not entitled to review the content of another
            user’s account. Accordingly, if you have used our Services to share
            personal information with another user or other party, you will not be
            able to access, update or delete that shared information pursuant to
            this Policy or your User Agreement. Please also note that other users
            may submit personal information that identifies you. You will also not
            be able to access, update or delete that information pursuant to this
            Policy or your User Agreement. In either case, certain users – such as
            healthcare providers – may be required under HIPAA and other applicable
            laws or regulations to retain such information for extended periods of
            time. This means that until our User Agreement with such user(s)
            terminate(s); we will continue to retain such information on their
            behalf. HIPAA grants patients certain rights to access and correct
            certain health information their healthcare providers retain about them.
            Patients should submit requests to access or correct their health
            information directly to their healthcare providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also be aware that we store indefinitely non-personal
            information, including Engagement Data and de-identified health
            information, as well as all information that you have share on any of
            our public communities, surveys and the like.
