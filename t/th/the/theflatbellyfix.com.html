        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via our Website, your information is protected both online and offline. <strong>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.</strong> You can verify this by looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page. We use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, and we also protect your information offline.</p>
        <p>Only employees who require the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
        <h2>Cookie Usage</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
        <p>We use cookies to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.</li>
        <li>Understand and save user’s preferences for future visits.</li>
        <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

        <h2>Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</h2>
        <p>In addition to cookies, certain third party services, such as Google and Facebook may use web beacons and similar technologies to track users in the same way that cookies do (as noted above). You can opt out of these services here: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></p>

        <h2>Google</h2>
        <p>We have implemented Demographics and Interests Reporting, and Google Advertising Features including remarketing.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative consent to, that merger.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first and third-party cookies and anonymous identifiers to compile data regarding user interactions with our website. It’s also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website. This allows us to make special offers and continue to market our services to those who have shown interest in our service.</p>
