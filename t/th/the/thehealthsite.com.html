<p>In keeping with the traditions of India Webportal Pvt. Ltd, we refer to customers of India Webportal Pvt.

<p>3. Information That We Collect from Others</p>
<p>We may supplement personally identifiable information that we have collected directly from our guests with other information that we obtain from third parties and other members / affiliates of India Webportal Pvt. Ltd.</p>
<p>In addition, we may obtain information about individuals who are not yet users of our Web sites or guests of India Webportal Pvt. Ltd. In addition, when we associate information that we obtain from third parties or other members / affiliates of India Webportal Pvt. Ltd with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>C. HOW WE USE AND SHARE THE INFORMATION</p>
<p>India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may use your personally identifiable information in many ways, including sending you promotional materials, and sharing your information with third parties so that these third parties can send you promotional materials. (By “promotional materials,” we mean communications that directly promote the use of our Web sites, or the purchase of products or services.)</p>
<p>1. India Webportal Pvt, Licensees and Co-Branding Participants</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information collected under this Privacy Policy is shared among and used by India Webportal Pvt Ltd. for many purposes. For example, India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may use your personal information to send you promotional materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) either offered by India Webportal Pvt Ltd. or offered by third parties. These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail or other means. Please keep in mind, however, that when you purchase or request products or services from India Webportal Pvt Ltd., promotional materials may accompany delivery of that product or service.</p>
<p>India Webportal Pvt. Ltd. may also use your personal information for many purposes other than sending you promotional materials. (We refer to all of these types of uses of your personal information that do not involve the sending of promotional materials as “Operational Uses.”)For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of a product or service offered on our Web sites), or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>In addition to using your personal information within India Webportal Pvt Ltd., India Webportal Pvt. Ltd., may share your personal information with companies that offer products and/or services under brand names of India Webportal Pvt. Ltd. These companies are called “licensees.” For example, a company that publishes and sells books under the ” India Webportal Pvt Ltd.” brand would be such a licensee.</p>
<p>India Webportal Pvt. Ltd., may also share your information with companies that offer products and/or services that are co-branded using brand names of India Webportal Pvt Ltd.</p>
<p>When India Webportal Pvt Ltd. shares personal information with third parties acting as licensees and co-branding participants, these licensees and co-branding participants are restricted by contract from using the personal information for any marketing or promotional purpose that is not related to a licensed or co-branded product or service.</p>
<p>You may engage in transactions (such as purchasing products or services) without registering and logging on our Web sites. These transactions may be either with us or with other affiliated members of India Webportal Pvt Ltd. (We refer to all of these transactions that you engage in without registering and logging on our Web sites as “Non-Registered Transactions.”) An example would be when you purchase items through an India Webportal Pvt Ltd. e-commerce service without registering and logging on that Web site. When you engage in Non-Registered Transactions your information will not be shared with third parties and will not be used by any member of India Webportal Pvt Ltd. to send you promotional materials other than the member involved in your transaction, except as separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Finally, India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon the right of India Webportal Pvt Ltd. to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way.</p>
<p>2. Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</p>
<p>India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may share your personal information with selected third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services (including special offers and promotions) offered by them. When sharing your information for promotional purposes, India Webportal Pvt Ltd. attempts to select only reputable companies that offer high quality products and services.</p>

<p>India Webportal Pvt Ltd may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you.</p>
<p>When India Webportal Pvt Ltd. shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this “Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services” section, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information.</p>
<p>In addition to the promotional sharing that is subject to your choices India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may also share your information when you engage in certain activities on our sites that are sponsored by third parties, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party.</p>
<p>India Webportal Pvt Ltd. may also share your personal information when you respond to promotional materials from India Webportal Pvt Ltd. and authorize a third party to use your personal information for purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game. (We refer to all of these activities and requests as “Sponsored Activities.”) When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate may use your personal information (including, in some cases, your e-mail address) in accordance with the sponsor or business associate’s privacy practices.</p>
<p>3. Companies That Facilitate Communications and Transactions with You</p>
<p>Sometimes India Webportal Pvt Ltd. hires companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies.</p>

<p>4. Companies That You Previously Authorized to Obtain Your Information</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, your dealings with a third party may have authorized that third party to obtain your personal information from India Webportal Pvt Ltd. and to use that information in accordance with the third party’s own privacy practices and policies. For example, in using an online shopping service (such as the shopping services offered by Internet portals that refer the portal’s users to third-party merchants), you may have authorized that shopping service to obtain from the service’s participating third-party merchants (including India Webportal Pvt Ltd.) information about your purchases conducted through the shopping service.</p>
<p>India Webportal Pvt Ltd.will provide such companies only the information that you authorized (except as separately permitted under other provisions of this Privacy Policy). In the example given above, the shopping service would be provided only information concerning purchases you made from India Webportal Pvt Ltd. through that shopping service, and would not be provided any other information concerning you, unless any additional sharing of your personal information were separately permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>5. Purchase or Sale of Businesses</p>
<p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.</p>
<p>In the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy if it is practicable and permissible to do so.</p>
<p>In the event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).</p>
<p>In light of this protection, nothing in this paragraph will affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph will also apply in the event that one or more businesses of any other member of India Webportal Pvt Ltd. are sold and personal information subject to this Privacy Policy is transferred to a purchaser of those businesses.</p>
