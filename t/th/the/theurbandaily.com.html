<p>This website, together with a network of related content and social networking websites (each, a “Site,” and collectively, the “Company Sites”), is owned and operated by or on behalf of Radio One, Inc. (“Radio One”), Interactive One, LLC, Community Connect Inc., and/or certain other Radio One subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from you and how we may use and share that information. This Privacy Policy also explains the choices you can make about the ways this information is used by us.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use provided at each Site, which governs your use of the Company Sites. By accessing and using any of the Company Sites (including, without limitation, any social networking features, communities or other interactive content offered on the Sites), you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use provided on the Site. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Site. Please note that certain features or services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Company Sites at any particular time.</p>
<h2>APPLICABILITY AND USER RESTRICTIONS</h2>
<p>Unless specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies to information collected on the Company Sites, which also may be governed by separate or additional policies and does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, third party web sites (e.g., ad serving and tracking services), applications or offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Company Sites. The information collected or received by such affiliated providers and third parties is subject to their own respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for compliance with other websites’ privacy policies or practices.</p>
<p>The Company Sites are not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13). In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (”COPPA”), we use reasonable commercial efforts to adhere to the prohibition on the collection of personal information online from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. At a minimum, the Company Sites prohibit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under the age of thirteen (13). Company Site use and membership is void where prohibited by law.<br>
<a><br>
</a></p>
<h2><a name="about-our-ads">INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Whether you are a Company Site visitor or a registered member, we take certain steps to protect your information. Collection of information is usually grouped into two categories: Personal Information, which is information that is personally identifiable to a specific member (further defined below), and aggregate information, which is general demographic information that does not identify any individual member. We may use or disclose aggregate information for any purpose.</p>
<p>The Company adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (the “Principles”), developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet.&nbsp; To learn more about the Principles, please go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
<h3>User Content</h3>
<p>Please note that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online (e.g., through email, social networking platforms, forums, message boards, chat areas, or similar web pages), such information may be collected, exported and used by people that you do not know. Posting personal information in public places may result in unsolicited communications, including unwanted email messages or other forms of contact. Always be smart about the information you provide online. We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information you may disclose on the Company Sites.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information collected online about an individual, such as a first and last name, a physical street address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a social security number, or any other information that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.&nbsp; You can browse the Company Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, there are certain features and services (including social networking) that may not be available for your use without providing Personal Information. If you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers.&nbsp; Further, you consent to e-mail or other marketing communications sent by us, unless you unsubscribe from such messages or opt-out, as described below.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Certain features and services of the Company Sites may require you to first complete a registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to provide certain Personal Information. We may use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest. In addition to Personal Information collected for registration purposes, we may collect and store the following:</p>
<p>(a) your responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on the Sites;</p>
<p>(b) information about the Sites’ services or features that you use, and how frequently you use them;</p>
<p>(c) commercial transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, billing or shipping information, or a history of products purchased through the Company Sites);</p>
<p>(d) your responses to or entries for surveys, sweepstakes, and contests and requests for services, products, newsletters or information;</p>
<p>(e) customer service information about you as a user of a Company Site, including any suggestions you submit to us for review;</p>
<p>(f) community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our Sites, and correspondence sent to us;</p>
<p>(g) your activity on the Company Sites, including adding a friend, sharing a photo or video, or accessing an application;</p>
<p>(h) your activity on certain third party sites or services for which you have consented to connect or share through your account on a Company Site;</p>
<p>(i) information from other companies, such as demographic and traffic data; and</p>
<p>(j) other information from your interaction with our Sites, services, content and advertising, including computer and/or mobile device connection and location information, browser type, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information.</p>
<h3>Profile and Preference Information</h3>
<p>So that you can make the most of our social networking features, your member name, profile photo and certain other profile information associated with your account with a Company Site or with any third party sites shared by you through a Company Site will not be private.&nbsp; Depending on your privacy settings, you can control other information shared on your member page.&nbsp; If you do not wish to share photos of yourself with other members, then delete them or do not post them.</p>
<p>We may combine information that you provide us with other information about you that we may obtain through your use of the Company Sites in order to provide promotions and marketing offers tailored to your preferences and to improve the content of the Company Sites for you.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>To enhance your experience with the Company Sites, we may use “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that we place in your computer’s browser when you visit the Company Sites. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, to help serve advertisements, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate the Company Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Cookies automatically identify your web browser whenever you visit the Company Sites, help us determine which areas are popular and further personalize your experience on the Company Sites. If you do not wish to allow for use of cookies, you can generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Company Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.&nbsp; Please refer to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>The Company Sites and our e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon that monitors and collects certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message. Web beacons typically are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate the Company Sites, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) that we send are actually opened. Additionally, our advertising providers may use web beacons or similar technologies to personalize and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements using data gathered over time from users of the Company Sites.&nbsp; If you would like more information about the information collection practices of some of these third party advertising companies and to learn which of these companies allow you to opt out of this type of information collection, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>
<h3>IP Address and Log Files</h3>
<p>Upon visiting the Company Sites, we may collect and store your browser type and IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Company Sites, to help identify and analyze user trends, to customize content and advertisements offered to you, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<h2>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
<h3>Third Party Content</h3>
<p>When you are visiting the Company Sites, certain content may be served directly by third parties. This third party content may use cookies, web beacons, Javascript or other technologies. We do not have access to or control the use of such technology by third parties, including the information they collect or how they use such information.</p>
<h3>Applications and Websites</h3>
<h3>The Company does not own or operate certain applications or websites (e.g., games or tools) accessible through the Company Sites.&nbsp; As a result, when you use these third party applications or websites, we may share your information along with the location of your computer or mobile device to enable your use of such services and for age verification and security purposes, among other purposes.&nbsp; For example, the Company may offer you the option to connect your member profile and activity on the Company Sites with certain third party services such as Facebook, Foursquare or Twitter (“Third Party Services”).&nbsp; When you consent to publish your information or activity on the Company Sites to any Third Party Services, such information will be viewable by the communities on such Third Party Services and may be used by such Third Party Services in accordance with their posted privacy practices.&nbsp; Similarly, if another member in your friend list uses a third party application or website, it may receive your non-private member information so that you may be separately linked with your friend.&nbsp; If the application or website seeks any further information, your consent should be requested.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee that such applications or websites will follow our privacy practices, so we encourage you to always review their information sharing policies and to report any application or website that may be in violation of our privacy practices.</h3>
<h3>Online Shopping Services</h3>
<p>Company Sites may offer shopping services either directly or through a partner that operates a service under contract with us. If a Site offers shopping or other commercial services, the customer order form will ask you to provide certain Personal Information, including credit card or other payment data. The financial information that you provide will be used by the Company or its partners to bill you for products and services that you request and for any other uses to which you have consented. By giving the Site your payment data and related Personal Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company and/or you are authorizing the Company’s partner directly to confirm and fulfill your order. In addition, the Company and/or its partners will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders and for customer service purposes. The Company will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.</p>
<h3>Other Third Parties</h3>
<p>Our employees, agents and contractors must have a “need-to-know” business reason to obtain access to your Personal Information. We may share your Personal Information with those who help us manage or provide content or other services for the Company Sites (e.g., forum administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes. Such outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide the Company Sites with a specific service and not for any other purpose. We may also provide your Personal Information to a third party where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires sharing your Personal Information. We also may share your Personal Information with any affiliated companies and partners if we have a business reason to do so.</p>
<h3>Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>We may access or disclose your Personal Information without your consent in order to: (i) protect or defend our legal rights or property, including those of our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of other users of the Company Sites or members of the public, including responding to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if any Company Site is sold to or merges with another company not owned by or affiliated with Company, we may transfer your Personal Information to any acquiring or merging party as part of that transaction.</p>
<h2>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</h2>
<p>The following sub-headings apply only to those Company Sites for which user registration is available.</p>
<h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to correct, update or remove Personal Information you have provided to us at any time. Upon entering any Company Site, you may sign in using your previously issued login name and password. After signing in, click on “My Page” and you will have the option of either modifying or deleting your member profile settings through the “Edit Profile” or “My Account” links. If you have forgotten your login name or password, click the “Forgot your password?” link, and following verification, your login name and/or password will be sent to your email address.</p>
<h4>Activity Associated with Your Member Name</h4>
<p>Your member name is displayed to other members throughout the Company Sites and depending on your activity (e.g., blogging) on any Sites, may also be available to the public. All of your activity on our Sites is traceable to your member name. Therefore, if you associate your name with your member name, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Company Site activities.</p>
<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving e-mail communications from us at any time by either following the instructions to unsubscribe within an email you receive from this Site or by logging in to your account and selecting “Email Alerts” under the “My Account” link. As explained above, if you choose not to provide us with information sought on registration or sign up forms, it is possible that you will not be able to access or use certain features of certain Company Sites.</p>
<h3>Your Member Profile</h3>
<p>When you register with certain Company Sites, you may set up your member profile, upload photos, provide additional information, search, add friends, send messages, perform searches and engage in other activities. Information transmitted during such activities is collected so that the Company may provide you with services and personalize certain features. Any content you post on the Company Sites is at your own risk. Certain privacy options exist on the Company Sites that allow you to limit access to your profile. However, such privacy options are not always available or perfect. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Company Site. Furthermore, the Company cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you choose to share your profile or Personal Information. Because of the foregoing, the Company does not guarantee that any content or personal information you post on a Company Site will not be accessible by unauthorized persons. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.&nbsp; Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on any Company Site is a violation of the Site’s Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Friend Referrals</h3>
<p>The Company Sites may allow you invite a friend to view or use certain features or services Company Sites, including online shopping services. To refer a friend, information including your friend’s email address is required. Such information is collected and stored to send this one-time invitation, to allow for your friend’s registration and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our records.</p>
<h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>The Company employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice to secure information collected through the Company Sites. We also use internal protections to limit access to your Personal Information to only those people who need the information to perform a specific request. However, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (e.g., as a result of unauthorized or otherwise unlawful third party access), and you transmit such information to us at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Account Protection</h4>
<p>Your member profile is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this information. Please use a unique combination of numbers, letters and special characters and do not disclose your Company Site password to anyone for greater protection. If you share your computer with other people, or use a publicly accessible computer, sign out of your account and close your browser window when you are done. If you do share your password or your Personal Information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken under your member profile.

(AP) — A judge on Tuesday ruled that a 13-year-old Northern California girl declared brain dead after suffering complications following a tonsillectomy can be taken off life support.  But Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo gave Jahi McMath's family until 5 p.m. Dec. 30 to file an appeal. She will stay on life support until then. Relatives said the family has not decided if they would keep fighting.  &quot;It's Christmas Eve, there is still time for a miracle,&quot; said Omari Sealey, the girl's uncle. He said the family would discuss and decide later whether to appeal or to allow Children's Hospital of Oakland to remove the girl from a ventilator.  &quot;Prayers are more important than ever before,&quot; Sealey said. &quot;Because the clock is ticking.&quot;  Jahi's mother, Nailah Winkfield, didn't attend the court hearing, remaining with her daughter in the hospital where she will spend Christmas Eve.  Sealey said Winkfield and other family members have remained with the teen since complications arose Dec. 9 after a tonsillectomy.  &quot;Room 325 of Children's Hospital is our new home,&quot; Sealey said.  Sealey held hands with Jahi's grandmother Sandra Chatman, Jahi's stepfather Martin Winkfield and the family's lawyer Christopher Dolan as the judge ruled.  Grillo based his decision on the conclusions of two doctors, court-appointed Dr. Paul Fisher of Stanford University and the hospital's Dr. Robin Shanahan.  Fisher examined the girl for several hours on Monday and reported to the judge Tuesday that the teen was brain dead, the same conclusion Shanahan reached.  Grillo said he had no other choice but to allow the hospital to remove the ventilator.  &quot;I wish I could fix it, but I can't,&quot; he said.  The hospital had argued that the teen had no chance of recovery since all brain function had ceased.  &quot;Our sincere hope is that the family finds peace and can come to grips with the judge's decision,&quot; hospital attorney Doug Strauss said outside court after Grillo's ruling.  Jahi's family has been battling with hospital administrators over keeping her on a ventilator since the teen suffered cardiac arrest after bleeding profusely following her operation.  The family said that as long as the teen was breathing, there was hope of recovery. The family also demanded an independent examination. They have said they believe Jahi is still alive and that the hospital should not remove her from the ventilator without its permission.  Hospital lawyers disagreed.  &quot;Because Ms. McMath is dead, practically and legally, there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue; there is nothing to which the family's consent is applicable,&quot; the hospital said in a court filing on Tuesday.  The case is now out of Grillo's court and the decision will be up to the California Court of Appeal if the family decides to pursue its legal case to keep Jahi on the ventilator.  The family thanked Fisher, the court-appointed doctor, for what they called a thorough examination of Jahi, and he shook the hand of each family member before leaving court.  &quot;I don't know if we have accepted his decision yet,&quot; said Sealey, Jahi's uncle. &quot;There's still time for a miracle from now and until Dec. 30.&quot;  The family had demanded that another doctor of its choosing examine Jahi.  In ruling Tuesday, the judge made no mention of the family's desire for Dr. Paul Byrne, a pediatric professor at the University of Toledo, to examine the teen.  Byrne is the co-editor of the 2001 book &quot;Beyond Brain Death,&quot; which presents a variety of arguments against using brain-based criteria for declaring a person dead.  In a phone interview, Byrne said he could not comment in detail because he had not seen any of Jahi's medical records. But the fact that her ventilator is still functioning properly is a sign that she is alive, he said.  &quot;The ventilator won't work on a corpse,&quot; he said. &quot;In a corpse, the ventilator pushes the air in, but it won't come out. Just the living person pushes the air out.&quot;  Arthur L. Caplan, who leads the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center and is not involved in Jahi's case, told The Associated Press that once brain death has been declared, a hospital is under no obligation to keep a patient on a ventilator.  &quot;Brain death is death,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;They don't need permission from the family to take her off, but because the little girl died unexpectedly and so tragically, they're trying to soften the blow and let the family adjust to the reality.&quot;">Judge Rules Jahi McMath, 13-Year-Old Declared Brain Dead Following Tonsillectomy, Can Be Taken Off Life Support</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/24/nelson-mandela-oprah-christmas_n_4493153.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="In 2002, Oprah and her staff of volunteers traveled to South Africa to bring Christmas joy to 50,000 unsuspecting schoolchildren and orphans devastated by the AIDS epidemic. Many of those children walked miles -- in tattered shoes or no shoes at all -- to meet up with the staff. When the children arrived, Oprah said, their joy was contagious.  Believing they were there to simply attend &quot;a party,&quot; the children smiled, danced and laughed with the volunteers -- and got their feet measured. Without explaining why, Oprah's volunteers measured the size of each child's feet so they could later be sent home with a brand new pair of shoes. It was a surprise to many, who didn't realize there would be any gifts at the event.  But that wasn't even the biggest surprise.  As a helicopter descended toward a field near the tents, Oprah's own excitement was noticeable. &quot;There's our 'Wizard of Oz' moment,&quot; she said, watching the helicopter. &quot;Here comes the Wizard!&quot;  The helicopter doors opened and out stepped former South African President Nelson Mandela. &quot;To the world, the people of South Africa and to me, he is a beloved and inspiring hero,&quot; Oprah said.

Judge Allen Baddour presided over a Wake County Superior Court hearing on Monday in which he overturned an administrative decision to confine the demonstrators to Halifax Mall, a big grassy area enclosed by state office and legislative buildings. The hearing was held hours before an evening rally organized by the NAACP state chapter president Rev. William Barber II and others opposed to new policies and laws adopted this summer by the Republican-led General Assembly. The NAACP and other groups have asked Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican from Mecklenburg County, to convene a special legislative session to rescind 2013 decisions to reject a federally funded Medicaid expansion and cut programs for North Carolina's poor. To underscore the argument, Barber brought hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of protesters to the Halifax Mall. A police estimate of the crowd wasn't immediately available. An NAACP spokesman put the count as high as 2,500. The crowd gathered under a blanket of clouds that didn't so much threaten rain as continuously dump it, the protesters a growing cluster of umbrellas around Barber's peaked white tent. The first &quot;Moral Monday&quot; event held in Raleigh since the summer offered Barber a chance to rekindle the movement. He promised that 2014 would be a fighting year, and he outlined plans to legally challenge state government, document the effects of new policies on individual people, and push McCrory further on a few issues. &quot;If you think we fought in 2013, you ought to see how we fight in an election year ... you haven't seen a fight,&quot; he said. As gray skies darkened, the crowd left the mall in a line two, three and four people wide. The line eventually stretched almost a half-mile from the legislative lawn to the Christmas tree near the steps of the old N.C. State Capitol. There Barber and other speakers led the crowd in hymns and gave Christmas-themed sermons on state politics before the huge, brilliantly decorated tree. It was &quot;hypocrisy,&quot; Barber said by megaphone, for McCrory to have lit the tree weeks earlier while enacting &quot;unmerciful&quot; policies. 'The people's space' Besides becoming a point in Barber's speech, McCrory's tree lighting also was part of the court argument that won the NAACP its right to assemble on the grounds. In court on Monday morning, Scott Holmes, a longtime Durham-based and director of The Civil Litigation Law Clinic at N.C. Central University, told the judge that people have long gathered at the state capitol for a variety of activities. &quot;The state cannot stand up and say, in good faith, that hundreds of people cannot gather,&quot; Holmes argued to Baddour. &quot;If the people of North Carolina cannot go to the state Capitol after work to pray, where can they go? ... It is the people's space, it is a public space, and therefore we have a right to go there.&quot; Donald Teeter Sr., a special deputy attorney general, argued that the administration needed some discretion in deciding which permits to issue. Typically, Teeter said, the administration works to limit gatherings on the capitol grounds to a paved area that accommodates about 100 people. As part of the permit application process, the administration seeks information from groups about their plans for the grounds. On rainy days, Teeter added, a large crowd could leave behind a sloshy mess. Baddour asked what would happen if a group stated it planned to have 100 people at a rally or demonstration and more showed up. Teeter had no quick response. Baddour pointed out that Halifax Mall, like the Capitol grounds, is a grassy area that also could become a muddy mess on a rainy day. He added that whether the group that was gather had a permit or not, the damage likely would be the same. &quot;It's the actions that control how the grounds are used, and not the speech,&quot; Baddour said. &quot;The difference here is speech. A concern the court has is whether that's discretionary.&quot; Administration decries protest McCrory spokesman Rick Martinez on Monday criticized the protesters and said that the administration offered a better chance for the impoverished. &quot;These are the same left-wing political groups that are wanting to keep the failed policies of the past that put people out of work,&quot; Martinez told Associated Press. &quot;Instead, Gov.McCrory is working to strengthen the economy so more North Carolinians can earn a paycheck instead of hoping for a government check,&quot; he said. McCrory had been invited to join the crowd, Barber said, but was not seen. Those who did attend, though, included a mix of Moral Monday fixtures and first-time attendees. The &quot;Raging Grannies,&quot; who were a regular sight over the summer protests, were out again in their floral hats. They knew they'd come, but some weren't so sure about the rest of the crowd. &quot;I was thinking, oh, maybe the rain will keep people home. ... I was just hoping it would pick up where we left off,&quot; said Christine Carlson, 71, a retired bus driver living in Carrboro. &quot;The rain doesn't usually keep people from Christmas shopping. This is just as important to us,&quot; said Ruth Gibson, 66, a retired minister living in Chapel Hill. Casey Aldridge, 19, made the trip from UNC-Charlotte. He'd attended a Monday protest there, but he'd long waited to get to Raleigh. &quot;You weren't at the seat of power (in Charlotte),&quot; said the political science major, who came with the N.C. Student Power Union. Ruth Wood, 64, also was a first-timer. The North Carolina native watched the movement from New Mexico through social media, her son and the national news. &quot;We were so proud,&quot; she said, to see her son arrested for civil disobedience. For Natalie Bullock Brown, 44, the return of &quot;Moral Monday&quot; to Raleigh opened another outlet for her growing advocacy. &quot;I've always had an activist instinct, but I've not always known exactly what to do with it,&quot; said Brown, who teaches film at Saint Augustine's University. In the coming weeks, the NAACP will look for a lot more people like her. It has renamed its signature Raleigh event, the Historic Thousands on Jones Street march, to include the words &quot;Moral Monday&quot; in its title. The march will return to Raleigh in February.

(AP) — A judge on Tuesday ruled that a 13-year-old Northern California girl declared brain dead after suffering complications following a tonsillectomy can be taken off life support.  But Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo gave Jahi McMath's family until 5 p.m. Dec. 30 to file an appeal. She will stay on life support until then. Relatives said the family has not decided if they would keep fighting.  &quot;It's Christmas Eve, there is still time for a miracle,&quot; said Omari Sealey, the girl's uncle. He said the family would discuss and decide later whether to appeal or to allow Children's Hospital of Oakland to remove the girl from a ventilator.  &quot;Prayers are more important than ever before,&quot; Sealey said. &quot;Because the clock is ticking.&quot;  Jahi's mother, Nailah Winkfield, didn't attend the court hearing, remaining with her daughter in the hospital where she will spend Christmas Eve.  Sealey said Winkfield and other family members have remained with the teen since complications arose Dec. 9 after a tonsillectomy.  &quot;Room 325 of Children's Hospital is our new home,&quot; Sealey said.  Sealey held hands with Jahi's grandmother Sandra Chatman, Jahi's stepfather Martin Winkfield and the family's lawyer Christopher Dolan as the judge ruled.  Grillo based his decision on the conclusions of two doctors, court-appointed Dr. Paul Fisher of Stanford University and the hospital's Dr. Robin Shanahan.  Fisher examined the girl for several hours on Monday and reported to the judge Tuesday that the teen was brain dead, the same conclusion Shanahan reached.  Grillo said he had no other choice but to allow the hospital to remove the ventilator.  &quot;I wish I could fix it, but I can't,&quot; he said.  The hospital had argued that the teen had no chance of recovery since all brain function had ceased.  &quot;Our sincere hope is that the family finds peace and can come to grips with the judge's decision,&quot; hospital attorney Doug Strauss said outside court after Grillo's ruling.  Jahi's family has been battling with hospital administrators over keeping her on a ventilator since the teen suffered cardiac arrest after bleeding profusely following her operation.  The family said that as long as the teen was breathing, there was hope of recovery. The family also demanded an independent examination. They have said they believe Jahi is still alive and that the hospital should not remove her from the ventilator without its permission.  Hospital lawyers disagreed.  &quot;Because Ms. McMath is dead, practically and legally, there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue; there is nothing to which the family's consent is applicable,&quot; the hospital said in a court filing on Tuesday.  The case is now out of Grillo's court and the decision will be up to the California Court of Appeal if the family decides to pursue its legal case to keep Jahi on the ventilator.  The family thanked Fisher, the court-appointed doctor, for what they called a thorough examination of Jahi, and he shook the hand of each family member before leaving court.  &quot;I don't know if we have accepted his decision yet,&quot; said Sealey, Jahi's uncle. &quot;There's still time for a miracle from now and until Dec. 30.&quot;  The family had demanded that another doctor of its choosing examine Jahi.  In ruling Tuesday, the judge made no mention of the family's desire for Dr. Paul Byrne, a pediatric professor at the University of Toledo, to examine the teen.  Byrne is the co-editor of the 2001 book &quot;Beyond Brain Death,&quot; which presents a variety of arguments against using brain-based criteria for declaring a person dead.  In a phone interview, Byrne said he could not comment in detail because he had not seen any of Jahi's medical records. But the fact that her ventilator is still functioning properly is a sign that she is alive, he said.  &quot;The ventilator won't work on a corpse,&quot; he said. &quot;In a corpse, the ventilator pushes the air in, but it won't come out. Just the living person pushes the air out.&quot;  Arthur L. Caplan, who leads the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center and is not involved in Jahi's case, told The Associated Press that once brain death has been declared, a hospital is under no obligation to keep a patient on a ventilator.  &quot;Brain death is death,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;They don't need permission from the family to take her off, but because the little girl died unexpectedly and so tragically, they're trying to soften the blow and let the family adjust to the reality.&quot;">Judge Rules Jahi McMath, 13-Year-Old Declared Brain Dead Following Tonsillectomy, Can Be Taken Off Life Support</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/24/nelson-mandela-oprah-christmas_n_4493153.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="In 2002, Oprah and her staff of volunteers traveled to South Africa to bring Christmas joy to 50,000 unsuspecting schoolchildren and orphans devastated by the AIDS epidemic. Many of those children walked miles -- in tattered shoes or no shoes at all -- to meet up with the staff. When the children arrived, Oprah said, their joy was contagious.  Believing they were there to simply attend &quot;a party,&quot; the children smiled, danced and laughed with the volunteers -- and got their feet measured. Without explaining why, Oprah's volunteers measured the size of each child's feet so they could later be sent home with a brand new pair of shoes. It was a surprise to many, who didn't realize there would be any gifts at the event.  But that wasn't even the biggest surprise.  As a helicopter descended toward a field near the tents, Oprah's own excitement was noticeable. &quot;There's our 'Wizard of Oz' moment,&quot; she said, watching the helicopter. &quot;Here comes the Wizard!&quot;  The helicopter doors opened and out stepped former South African President Nelson Mandela. &quot;To the world, the people of South Africa and to me, he is a beloved and inspiring hero,&quot; Oprah said.

Judge Allen Baddour presided over a Wake County Superior Court hearing on Monday in which he overturned an administrative decision to confine the demonstrators to Halifax Mall, a big grassy area enclosed by state office and legislative buildings. The hearing was held hours before an evening rally organized by the NAACP state chapter president Rev. William Barber II and others opposed to new policies and laws adopted this summer by the Republican-led General Assembly. The NAACP and other groups have asked Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican from Mecklenburg County, to convene a special legislative session to rescind 2013 decisions to reject a federally funded Medicaid expansion and cut programs for North Carolina's poor. To underscore the argument, Barber brought hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of protesters to the Halifax Mall. A police estimate of the crowd wasn't immediately available. An NAACP spokesman put the count as high as 2,500. The crowd gathered under a blanket of clouds that didn't so much threaten rain as continuously dump it, the protesters a growing cluster of umbrellas around Barber's peaked white tent. The first &quot;Moral Monday&quot; event held in Raleigh since the summer offered Barber a chance to rekindle the movement. He promised that 2014 would be a fighting year, and he outlined plans to legally challenge state government, document the effects of new policies on individual people, and push McCrory further on a few issues. &quot;If you think we fought in 2013, you ought to see how we fight in an election year ... you haven't seen a fight,&quot; he said. As gray skies darkened, the crowd left the mall in a line two, three and four people wide. The line eventually stretched almost a half-mile from the legislative lawn to the Christmas tree near the steps of the old N.C. State Capitol. There Barber and other speakers led the crowd in hymns and gave Christmas-themed sermons on state politics before the huge, brilliantly decorated tree. It was &quot;hypocrisy,&quot; Barber said by megaphone, for McCrory to have lit the tree weeks earlier while enacting &quot;unmerciful&quot; policies. 'The people's space' Besides becoming a point in Barber's speech, McCrory's tree lighting also was part of the court argument that won the NAACP its right to assemble on the grounds. In court on Monday morning, Scott Holmes, a longtime Durham-based and director of The Civil Litigation Law Clinic at N.C. Central University, told the judge that people have long gathered at the state capitol for a variety of activities. &quot;The state cannot stand up and say, in good faith, that hundreds of people cannot gather,&quot; Holmes argued to Baddour. &quot;If the people of North Carolina cannot go to the state Capitol after work to pray, where can they go? ... It is the people's space, it is a public space, and therefore we have a right to go there.&quot; Donald Teeter Sr., a special deputy attorney general, argued that the administration needed some discretion in deciding which permits to issue. Typically, Teeter said, the administration works to limit gatherings on the capitol grounds to a paved area that accommodates about 100 people. As part of the permit application process, the administration seeks information from groups about their plans for the grounds. On rainy days, Teeter added, a large crowd could leave behind a sloshy mess. Baddour asked what would happen if a group stated it planned to have 100 people at a rally or demonstration and more showed up. Teeter had no quick response. Baddour pointed out that Halifax Mall, like the Capitol grounds, is a grassy area that also could become a muddy mess on a rainy day. He added that whether the group that was gather had a permit or not, the damage likely would be the same. &quot;It's the actions that control how the grounds are used, and not the speech,&quot; Baddour said. &quot;The difference here is speech. A concern the court has is whether that's discretionary.&quot; Administration decries protest McCrory spokesman Rick Martinez on Monday criticized the protesters and said that the administration offered a better chance for the impoverished. &quot;These are the same left-wing political groups that are wanting to keep the failed policies of the past that put people out of work,&quot; Martinez told Associated Press. &quot;Instead, Gov.McCrory is working to strengthen the economy so more North Carolinians can earn a paycheck instead of hoping for a government check,&quot; he said. McCrory had been invited to join the crowd, Barber said, but was not seen. Those who did attend, though, included a mix of Moral Monday fixtures and first-time attendees. The &quot;Raging Grannies,&quot; who were a regular sight over the summer protests, were out again in their floral hats. They knew they'd come, but some weren't so sure about the rest of the crowd. &quot;I was thinking, oh, maybe the rain will keep people home. ... I was just hoping it would pick up where we left off,&quot; said Christine Carlson, 71, a retired bus driver living in Carrboro. &quot;The rain doesn't usually keep people from Christmas shopping. This is just as important to us,&quot; said Ruth Gibson, 66, a retired minister living in Chapel Hill. Casey Aldridge, 19, made the trip from UNC-Charlotte. He'd attended a Monday protest there, but he'd long waited to get to Raleigh. &quot;You weren't at the seat of power (in Charlotte),&quot; said the political science major, who came with the N.C. Student Power Union. Ruth Wood, 64, also was a first-timer. The North Carolina native watched the movement from New Mexico through social media, her son and the national news. &quot;We were so proud,&quot; she said, to see her son arrested for civil disobedience. For Natalie Bullock Brown, 44, the return of &quot;Moral Monday&quot; to Raleigh opened another outlet for her growing advocacy. &quot;I've always had an activist instinct, but I've not always known exactly what to do with it,&quot; said Brown, who teaches film at Saint Augustine's University. In the coming weeks, the NAACP will look for a lot more people like her. It has renamed its signature Raleigh event, the Historic Thousands on Jones Street march, to include the words &quot;Moral Monday&quot; in its title. The march will return to Raleigh in February.

It's clear from the clip that Cumberbatch is enjoying himself, smirking and winking at the audience after every couplet. Check it out below, and just try not to squeal with glee.

In an interview with the New York Daily News, Portman revealed that the scene was shot after primary filming had ended, and due to a scheduling conflict, the actress wasn't able to make it back on set to reprise her role as Jane Foster. That's when Hemsworth's wife, actress Elsa Pataky (pictured below), stepped in.      &quot;And so they put his wife in my wig and costume, that's why it was so passionate,&quot; Portman explained. &quot;It was such a perfect solution, wasn't it?&quot;  The plan clearly worked, since there were no complaints from &quot;Thor&quot; fans about the switcheroo. The Daily News reports that a few trick camera angles helped keep up the ruse -- perhaps with an assist from Loki, the God of Mischief?

Lawrence is an obvious choice, having spent the past year winning an Oscar, breaking the box office with &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,&quot; and charming critics/kissing Amy Adams in the forthcoming &quot;American Hustle.&quot; When not winning as an actress, she's doing things like blowing up the Internet with her new pixie cut and happily discussing pooping her pants with David Letterman. The 23-year-old can do -- and say -- no wrong.  Pope Francis, Robin Roberts, long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad, and Edward Snowden round out the list of the year's most fascinating individuals, with Walters's number one pick set to be revealed when the 90-minute special airs on ABC on December 18.  Expect Lawrence to say something in her interview to make the Internet collectively guffaw and then want to marry her, or at least go out for beers.
