<div class="first-content">
<h4>Disclaimer &amp; privacy policy</h4>
<div class="first-row">&gt;</div>
<div class="row-content">The information we collect through our Site helps us provide you with information specific to your needs and interests. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”)   covers the ThePrivateSales.com website (the “Site”). Please read below to review our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our Site. In this Privacy Policy, 'we', 'us', 'our' and other similar references mean ThePrivateSales.com and 'you' and 'your' and other similar references mean a specific user of the Site. By visiting the Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</div>
<h4>How does ThePrivateSales.com gather and use information?</h4>
<div class="first-row">&gt;</div>
<div class="row-content">Cookies. Cookies are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the browser on your PC. Websites typically use temporary cookies called   “session” cookies to ensure that you are recognised when you move from page to page within one site and that any information you have entered is remembered. For   example, if an e-commerce site did not use session cookies then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear by the time you reach the checkout. Websites also use   cookies called “persistent” cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions   offered. ThePrivateSales.com attempts to install both persistent and session cookies when a user arrives at our Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather information   about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their browsers. Visit the “help” portion of   your toolbar for more information. If you block or refuse to accept cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be able to access or use certain   features or functions of our Site.</div>
<div class="first-row">&gt;</div>
<div class="row-content">Server Statistics. We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to   access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns. The information that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally identifiable   information about our users. It helps us track “where” our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas and determine the most effective ways   to communicate with our users. As part of that ongoing analysis, ThePrivateSales.com also uses devices called “web beacons” to help us identify when emails sent to you   have been received and read. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers into the ThePrivateSales.com site we may collect information, such as IP   addresses, into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the ThePrivateSales.com site.</div>
