<h2>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly accept, request, or solicit information from children or knowingly market to children under the age of 16. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 16, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Subprocessors</h3>
<p>In compliance with General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) Vecteezy uses certain subprocessors in providing our service.  A subprocessor is a third party data processor engaged by Vecteezy, who has or potentially have access to your personal information to support our service.</p>

<h2>What you can do to your personal information</h2>
<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by contacting us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Request a copy of your data</h3>
<p>You can request a copy of your information which we hold (in Europe this is known as a subject access request). If you would like a copy of some or all of it, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#47343237372835330722223d3e6924282a"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="54272124243b26201431312e2d7a373b39">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> and let us know the information you want a copy of, including any account or reference numbers, if you have them. Any subject access request may be subject to a reasonable fee to cover the cost of providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
<h3>Data portability request</h3>
<p>You have rights to obtain a copy of some of the Personal Information that we hold on you and reuse or share it for your own purposes (“right to data portability”).</p>
<p>The right to data portability only applies:</p>
<ul class="styled-list">
<li>to Personal Information you’ve provided to us (i.e. not any other information),</li>
<li>where we are processing your Personal Information because you have provided your consent for us to do so, or under a contract with you;  and</li>
<li>when processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can refuse your data portability request if the processing does not satisfy the above criteria.  Also, if the Personal Information concerns more than one individual, we may not be able to transfer the information to you if doing so would prejudice the other person’s rights.</p>
<h3>Request that we cease processing of your information</h3>
<p>You may request that we cease processing your personal information.  If you make such a request, we shall retain only the amount of personal information pertaining you that is necessary to ensure that no further processing of your personal information takes place.</p>
<h3>Emails and Communications</h3>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from us, you may opt-out by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hitting the unsubscribe button at the bottom of any of our newsletters or emails, or by contacting us using the contact information provided below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>We may retain some personal information related to financial transactions in order to prevent fraud and for financial record keeping.</p>

<h2>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information as well as the names and addresses of any businesses with which customer information was shared during the prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2018 will receive information regarding 2017 sharing activities). If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Site, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Site. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Site, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.</p>
