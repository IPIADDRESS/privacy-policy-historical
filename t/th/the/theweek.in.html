<p>This Privacy Policy describes THE WEEK's collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally THE WEEK's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., user interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE WEEK SERVICES</b></h3>

<h3><b>THE WEEK Collected Information</b></h3>
<p>THE WEEK Services Activity Information. When users access THE WEEK Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to THE WEEK Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access THE WEEK Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.
