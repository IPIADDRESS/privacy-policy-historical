<font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">TheStreet.com, Inc. shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy regarding the privacy of information we collect on our web sites. We have revised our policy in connection with the introduction of our new commerce platform. Please take some time to review the new version below.

TheStreet.com, Inc. gathers two types of data about users: (a) personal information, which individual users provide (i) when registering as a member of <i>TheStreet.com</i>, our free flagship site, (ii) when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and (iii) voluntarily at certain other points, such as contests or surveys; and (b) tracking information, which is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites.    

</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">

<b>Personal Information</b><br>
Personal information is gathered in several places on our web sites. We will always provide a secure area of our sites for you to enter your information, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information over the telephone or via email.

</font></p><ul><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">
<li><b>Registration</b><br>
Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet.com in
order to have access to our free commentary, analysis and news, but if you'd
like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, we require you to
register <a href="https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/register/freereg_benefits.jsp?action=freereg" target="_blank">here</a> to become a member. In order to register, you'll have to pick
a unique User Name and password, and supply us with your email address, zip
code, and, if you like, a daytime telephone number where we can reach you.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Premium Services</b><br>
If you'd like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based
services, we require you first to <a href="https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/register/freereg_benefits.jsp?action=freereg" target="_blank">register</a> as a member of TheStreet.com. In
order to register, you'll have to pick a unique User Name and password, and
supply us with your email address, zip code, and, if you like, a daytime
telephone number where we can reach you. Then, on the subscription
registration page for the premium service you are interested in, you'll need
to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or
paid subscription.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Real-Time Portfolio Tracker</b><br>
You may, at your option, subscribe to a real-time, streaming Portfolio
Tracker, which is provided to us as a result of a partnership with Money.net
Inc. Use of the Money.net Real-Time Portfolio Tracker is completely
voluntary and is the privacy or your portfolio information is governed by
Money.net's <a href="http://my.money.net/scripts/wrap?name=privacy&amp;wrap=yes" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Message Boards and Chats</b><br>
We provide message boards and chats for discussion of various topics.
Although any user of TheStreet.com may read messages posted to the boards,
only <i>RealMoney</i> subscribers are permitted to post on the boards. Frequently
asked questions on the use of the message boards can be found <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/talk/library/780279.html#netiquette" target="_blank">here</a>. No
additional personal information is required to post on the boards, but
participants are asked in the interests of accountability, honesty and
informed dialogue to include their full names in any posting, as well as any
positions they have in stocks being discussed. Please note that information
you post to a message board or chat will be available for any user of that
service to read, and is no longer private.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Surveys/Polls</b><br>
At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are
generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your
investment experience or your reactions to a particular article. Because
information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual
subscribers and is used internally to better market our services,
participation is voluntary. In addition, some columnists will on occasion
take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of
the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Contests and Purchases</b><br>
We sometimes offer contests in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants' identities and notifying the winners. If the contest is being administered by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names. We also require shipping and billing information in order to fulfill online purchases of tangible items, such as books and videos.
</li></font></ul><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">
