TheStreet.com, Inc. gathers two types of data about users: (a) personal information, which individual users provide (i) when registering as a member of <em>TheStreet.com</em>, our free flagship site, (ii) when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and (iii) voluntarily at certain other points, such as contests or surveys; and (b) tracking information, which is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites.  
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">

<b>Personal Information</b>
</font></p><p><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">
TheStreet.com collects personal information in several places on our web sites, which are set forth generally below.

</font></p><ul><font face="arial, helvetica, ms sans serif, sans-serif" size="2">
<li><b>Membership</b><br>
Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet.com in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on our flagship site, <em>www.thestreet.com</em>.  However, if you'd like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, gain access select commentary articles from <em>RealMoney</em> and daily archives of Jim Cramer's radio program, or use our <em>MyStockWatch</em> service to filter content from <em>TheStreet.com</em>, we require you to register <a href="https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?PID=PRFR-0003&amp;OID=000842">here</a> to become a member. In order to register, you'll have to supply us with your email and postal addresses, choose a unique User Name and password, and provide us with some additional information about you (the reason for your visit to TheStreet.com, what kind of investor you are, etc.).
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Premium Services</b><br>
If you'd like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, you first must <a href="https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?PID=PRFR-0003&amp;OID=000842">register</a> as a member of TheStreet.com as described above, and then you'll have to pick a unique User Name and password. Then, on the subscription registration page for the premium service you are interested in, you'll need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription. 
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Real-Time Portfolio Tracker</b><br>
You may, at your option, subscribe to a real-time, streaming Real-Time Portfolio Tracker, which is provided to us as a result of a partnership with B4Utrade.com Corp.

<p>
</p></li><li><b>MyStockWatch</b><br>
We provide a free service called MyStockWatch, which you can use to stay current on <em>TheStreet.com</em> or <em>RealMoney</em> coverage of stocks in your portfolio.  Registered members of TheStreet.com may create up to five lists with a maximum of 50 tickers each.  You must therefore enter in tickers of stocks you are interested in following.  This information is kept confidential and is not utilized for marketing purposes by TheStreet.com.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Chats, Reader's Forum and Moderator</b><br>
We provide chat events for discussion of various topics and we allow readers to submit questions to <em>RealMoney's</em> Reader's Forum and <em>Street Insight's</em> Moderator . No additional personal information is required to submit questions, but participants are asked in the interests of accountability, honesty and informed dialogue to include their full names, as well as any positions they have in stocks mentioned in the question submitted. Please note that information you submit to the Reader's Forum, the Moderator, or during a chat will be available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private. 
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Surveys/Polls</b><br>
At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reactions to a particular article. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally to better market our services, participation is voluntary. In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary. 
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
We sometimes offer contests or sweepstakes in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants' identities and notifying the winners. If the contest or sweepstakes is being administered by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.
