Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the interest rate you may be charged for the card. Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance. In addition, card issuers may use Third Parties in connection with the development of a “credit score” for you. If you do not want Third Party Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with an approval for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.</p><p>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</p><p><b>Aggregation and De-Personalization</b></p><p>We may take Your Information and de-personalize it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing Your Information).
