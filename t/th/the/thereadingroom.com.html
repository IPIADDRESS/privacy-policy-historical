        <p class="lh15 footer_phil_body">From Jane Eyre to Harry Potter, books have provided us with friends, enemies, partners in crime and strangers on a dark night. TheReadingRoom.com aims to provide a world in which all readers can enjoy the variety of books on offer to them. We embrace the fact that not all readers are the same. Some of our members read literary fiction, others love romance and some escape in fantasy. TheReadingRoom.com enables you to have both the magical adventures of books and friends to share them with. <a href="http://www.thereadingroom.com" title="share your comments with like-minded readers">Reading books online</a> with your real friends allows you to enjoy the fictitious ones all the more, as you share <strong>book reviews</strong> and get together through <strong>online book</strong> clubs. No one should have to adventure alone so join TheReadingRoom.com and share your passion for books!</p>
