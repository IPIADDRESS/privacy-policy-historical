We have these Google Web Funds locally stored on our server. For your safety, however, we would like to point out that the browser you use can connect to Google’s servers. As a result, Google learns that our website has been accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and attractive presentation of our online services.

More information about Google Web Fonts can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" title="Google faq">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" title="Google privat policy">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a> and <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" title="Google Settings">www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Social Media</strong></p>
<p>A. Facebook Pixel<br>
Our website uses Facebook’s visitor action pixel for conversion measurement, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, <span class="caps">USA</span> (“Facebook”). This way, the behavior of the site visitors can be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad.

The collected data are anonymous to us as the operator of this website, we can not draw conclusions about the identity of the users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with the Facebook data usage directive. As a result, Facebook can enable ads to be displayed on Facebook and outside of Facebook. This use of data can not be influenced by us as the site operator.

<p>B. Twitter<br>
Twitter is a microblogging service provided by the American company Twitter, Inc. (795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107). If you use The European, e.g. To call up one of our web pages that contains a Twitter button, your browser will also establish a direct connection to the Twitter servers and load the button from there. The information is transmitted to Twitter that an online service has been called. Even if you are not logged in, Twitter can collect and save usage data as needed. If you click on the Twitter buttons and “twitter” information via the opening Twitter window, you can forward the tweeted information to Twitter. This information will then be published in your Twitter user profile.<br>
Further information on the collection, analysis and processing of your data by Twitter as well as your related rights can be found in the privacy policy of Twitter, which can be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy" title="Twitter Privacy">https://twitter.com/en/privacy</a> is retrievable.</p>

The European homepage also includes Google+ buttons on the social network “Google+”. This social network is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, <span class="caps">USA</span>. The Google+ button is recognizable by the “+1” sign.<br>
If you e.g. If you visit one of our websites that contains a Google+ button, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Google servers and loads the button from there. The information is transmitted to Google Inc., that the corresponding page on The European was called. The content of the “+1” button is sent directly to your browser by Google and incorporated into the website by Google, so we have no control over the amount of data Google collects from the button Click on the button no personal data collected Only with logged in members of the social network Google+ data, among other things the IP address, are collected and processed.<br>
If you are a Google+ member and do not want Google to associate data with your Google + account when you visit The European, you must log out of Google+ before visiting The European. We do not know if and when you’ve used the Google+ button, but only receive aggregate, non-personal statistics about using the Google + button from Google. For details of what Google collects for its own purposes and information on how to further process and use the data, please read Google’s Privacy Policy at <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy" title="Google+ policy">https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy</a>.</p>
<p>D. YouTube<br>
Our website uses plugins from the Google-powered YouTube page. Site operator is YouTube, <span class="caps">LLC</span>, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, <span class="caps">USA</span>. When you visit one of our YouTube plug-in-enabled sites, you will be connected to the servers of YouTube. It tells the YouTube server which of our pages you’ve visited. If you’re logged into your YouTube account, YouTube will allow you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.<br>
The use of YouTube is in the interest of an attractive presentation of our online offers. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f <span class="caps">DSGVO</span>.<br>
Further information on how to deal with user data can be found in the privacy policy of YouTube under: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=de" title="Privacy Youtube">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=de</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Privacy Policy</strong><br>
It is currently not legally clear whether and to what extent all networks offer their services in accordance with European data protection regulations. We therefore expressly point out that the services used Facebook, Twitterr, Google+ and YouTube store the data of their users according to their data usage guidelines and use for business purposes. We have no influence on the data collection and its further use by the social networks. For example, there is no information on the extent to which, at what location and for what duration the data is stored, to what extent the networks comply with existing deletion obligations, which evaluations and links are made to the data and to whom the data is passed on.</p>
<p><strong>5. Newsletter</strong></p>
<p>The newsletter is distributed via “MailChimp”, a newsletter shipping platform of Rocket Science Group, <span class="caps">LLC</span>, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave # 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, <span class="caps">USA</span>. The e-mail addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as their other information described in these notes, are stored on the MailChimp servers in the <span class="caps">USA</span>. MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp may, according to its own information, use this data to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the shipping and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes, to determine from which countries the recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass them on to third parties. We rely on the reliability, IT and data security of MailChimp. MailChimp is certified under the US-EU privacy shield “Privacy Shield” and is committed to complying with EU data protection requirements. The Privacy Policy of MailChimp: <a href="https" title="Mailchimp private policy">https: //mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</a>: //mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/.</p>
<p>A. Content of the newsletter<br>
We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications with advertising information (hereinafter “newsletter”) only with the consent of the recipient or a legal permission. Insofar as the contents of a newsletter are concretely described, they are authoritative for the consent of the users. Incidentally, our newsletters contain information about the digital economy and all its branches (this may include, in particular, references to articles, advertisements, white papers, or online appearances).</p>
<p>B. Double opt-in and logging<br>
The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. That After registration, you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external e-mail addresses.<br>
The registration for the newsletter will be logged in order to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP address. Similarly, the changes to your data stored with MailChimp will be logged.</p>
<p>C. Statistical survey and analyzes<br>
The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”, i. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the MailChimp server when the newsletter is opened. This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval. This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.<br>
Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our desire nor that of MailChimp to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p>
<p>D. Online call and data management<br>
There are cases when we direct the newsletter recipients to the MailChimp websites. For example, Our newsletters contain a link that allows the newsletter recipients to retrieve the newsletters online (for example, in the event of problems with the e-mail program). Furthermore, newsletter recipients may store their data, such as correct the e-mail address later. Similarly, the privacy policy of MailChimp is only available on their page.<br>
In this context, we point out that on the websites of MailChimp cookies are used and thus personal data processed by MailChimp, their partners and service providers used (for example, Google Analytics). We have no influence on this data collection. For more information, see the privacy policy of MailChimp.
