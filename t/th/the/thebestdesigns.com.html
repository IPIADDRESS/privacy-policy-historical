<h4>3. Cookies</h4>
<p>Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website, although the cookies we use do not contain personally identifiable information. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and login to your account.</p>
<p>You may adjust the settings on your browser to refuse cookies, although some areas of our website may not work properly if you do so. To learn more about cookies, and to read instructions on how to disable cookies in your browser, you can visit <a href="https://cookiesandyou.com/">Cookies and You</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>4. Public Information and Sharing with Third Parties</h4>
<p><u>Social Media Platforms and Widgets</u></p>
<p>Our website includes social media features, such as the Pinterest “Pin It" button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.</p>
<p>Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website. We also maintain presences on social media platforms such as Twitter. Any information, communications, or materials you submit to us via a social media platform is done at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. We are not in control of the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves. Your interactions with those features and platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>

<p><u>Google Analytics</u></p>
<p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our website is used, but no personally identifiable data such as your name or email address is shared, and we anonymize your IP address in the Google Analytics code that we use so that your IP is not tracked. You can read more about Google's privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here</a>.</p>
<p><u>Affiliates</u></p>
<p>We are partnered with other websites, such as theme marketplaces, and those partnerships may include affiliate links in our website. When you click on one of these affiliate or referral links, a cookie may be used to track your visit to their website from ours, and if you make a purchase on their website, we will receive a small percentage of that sale for referring you. We are also very careful about the websites we partner with, and we will only partner with websites that we like and trust. The income that we receive from these affiliate links helps us to keep the website running and maintained. Although you do have the option to adjust the settings in your browser to refuse cookies if you do not want a purchase on one of our partner websites to be affiliated with our website referral.</p>
<p>We are currently partnered with the following websites as affiliates: ElegantThemes.com, Envato.com, Themeforest.com, Themify.com, Themetrust.com. Each of these websites has their own privacy and cookie policies, and we recommend that you read their policies for more information about how they collect and track data.</p>

<p>We use Google Adsense on our website to serve ads, although we keep these ad spots at a minimum to keep the website as user-friendly as possible. Google Adsense may use tracking to display relevant ads to you, although you can disable this in Google’s “Ad Personalization" settings to prevent tracking <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">here</a>, and you can read more about Google’s privacy policy here <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">here</a>.</p>
<p><u>Where Required by Law</u></p>
<p>We may disclose necessary information to the police, law enforcement agencies, security agencies and other third parties where we are legally obligated and/or permitted to do so.</p>
<p><u>Mergers and Acquisitions</u></p>
<p>As with any website, it is possible that in the future TheBestDesigns.com could buy, merge with, or be acquired by another company. We may disclose your information to the prospective seller or buyer of our website, along with any other advisers related to this sale or purchase. If TheBestDesigns.com or a substantial proportion of its assets are acquired by a third party, information held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets, and the company or individual taking over these assets would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.</p>
<h4>6. Data Retention Policy</h4>
<p>We retain data for the purposes of reporting, backup, and financial compliance for a period of up to five years. If you make a request to delete your account and your data, we will take steps to delete your data from our system (with the exception of the required data retention for tax or financial reporting). We will make every effort to complete your request within 30 days after the account and data deletion is requested.</p>
<p>If you ask us not to contact you, we will retain that information on a ’Do Not Contact’ list to minimize the risk of contacting you in the future.</p>

<p>Security is very important to us. In addition to using SSL, we also use the Sucuri Firewall service to help protect our website and the data within.

<p>Our Data Retention Policy (see number 6 above) explains the circumstances when we can or are obliged to retain information, however outside of those periods we will delete your information in line with our data retention policy and on request. We will maintain a record that you made an erasure request to reduce the likelihood of us contacting you in the future, but we will use that information for no other purpose.</p>

<p>You can ask us to send you the information you provided to us in electronic format.</p>
<p><u>To ask us not to process your information where you previously gave consent or where we are exercising our legitimate interest.</u></p>
<p>If you make a request for us to stop processing your information, we will review this request to see if there is an important reason for processing to continue, and then we will discuss this decision with you.</p>
<p>You cannot object to processing which is a legal obligation or where we must process your information to satisfy a contract that you entered via our website. If you previously gave consent and we processed your data on the basis of that consent, you cannot object to that past processing, although you can request that we stop processing it in the future.</p>
<p><u>To ask for a copy of the information we hold about you.</u></p>
<p>We will make every effort to respond to your request within 30 days of the request.</p>
<p><u>To ask us not to process your information for marketing purposes.</u></p>
<p>We currently do not send newsletters or marketing emails, although if we ever do, we will announce this in an email to account owners, and you will have the option to opt-in to those newsletter or marketing emails at that time. If you do not opt-in at the time of the announcement, then you will not be contacted with newsletter or marketing emails. If you do opt-in to a newsletter or marketing emails, and you change your mind or want to stop receiving the newsletter later on, you will be able to unsubscribe by clicking an “Unsubscribe” link in that email or by replying to let us know that you want to unsubscribe.</p>
<p><u>To ask us to delete your account.</u></p>
<p>You can request to delete your account at any time by sending an email to hello@thebestdesigns.com. Your account and any personally identifiable information collected for your account will be deleted, and we will make every effort to respond to this request within 30 days of the request.</p>
