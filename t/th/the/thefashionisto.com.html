After studying at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Art in Australia, Vivanco moved to New Zealand, where he began a career in photography, before moving to London.  Photographing models, it would not be long, until Vivanco's work made it to print, being featured in British magazine Dazed &amp; Confused.  Catching the attention of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Vivanco went on to photograph numerous works for the Italian label, publishing books, beginning in 2003 with Calcio, before moving on to other books that include the recent David Gandy retrospective." rel="nofollow">mariano vivanco</a>

The British designer and couturier was worldly known for his over-the-top, theatrical, and sometimes controversial runway productions, featuring his avant-garde taste and highly thought provoking designs, that could only be imagined and possessed by a genius like McQueen.  Often having the privileged front row at the edge of their seats, Alexander McQueen was a master at juxtaposing influences between contrasting elements that were both visually compelling and mentally stimulating.  The purchase of his entire degree collection at Central Saint Martins in 1994, by fashion editor Isabella Blow, marked the beginning of McQueen's remarkable career.  He was appointed head designer at Givenchy in 1996, succeeding John Galliano.  Due to his controversial collections and disputes at the French house, McQueen presented his final collection in 2001.  His own label was launched that very same year and menswear followed suit in 2004, which earned him the British Menswear Designer of the Year Award.  Tragically, in February 2010, Alexander McQueen was found dead in his apartment in London.  His label continues to operate and Sarah Burton, who was by McQueen's side for over a decade, was appointed as the new creative director of Alexander McQueen.

Since taking reign in 1997, Ghesquière has turned up the dial on volume and shape to the maximum.  Today, Balenciaga is Sci-Fi obsessed, techno-fabric crazed and sculpturally conceptual.  Ghesquière has revitalized Balenciaga and transformed the house into a multimillion dollar couture factory that churns out highly covetable items consistently, season after season.  Hot items include the much sought after harness platform boots, gladiator sandals, lego-inspired heels, shearling jacket and the signature Balenciaga City bag.

Two years later, Oscar de La Renta took the helm at Balmain and designed for the dwindling label from 1993 to 2001.

Since Decarnin's reign at Balmain, sales of the French house have doubled.

Over time, Bottega Veneta ventured into new territory by abandoning their classic understated look and explored a more trend-driven aesthetic.  They struggled to find their own identity and British designer Giles Deacon was brought on in an attempt to revive the label.  On the verge of bankruptcy, the Venetian label was ultimately acquired by the Gucci Group in 2001 and German designer Tomas Maier was made creative director.  Maier returned Bottega Veneta back to its roots, removing visible logos from the products and once again highlighting the signature intrecciato weave.  He presented his first collection in spring 2002 and brought the Venetian house back to the runway with the first womenswear ready-to-wear collection in 2005 and the first menswear show in 2006.

Best known for its slim fitting silhouettes and Rock 'n' Roll style, the French label quickly garnered a cult following of celebrities and designers.  It was widely rumored that Karl Lagerfeld shed off 90 pounds to fit into the clothing.  Due to the popularity of the label and new found attraction from women, there was dispute between Slimane and LVMH over the expansion of Dior Homme into womenswear.  Slimane's contract was ultimately not renewed and he presented his final collection in fall 2007.  He was replaced by Belgian designer, Kris Van Assche, who presented his new interpretation of Dior Homme in spring 2008.  The silhouette was reinvented and a more relaxed and loose fitting style was adopted." rel="nofollow">dior homme</a>

The purchase of his debut collection by Barney's New York marked the beginning of Van Noten's international success.  The womenswear range is best known for its silk satin dresses that hang beautifully on the body with a trademark dropped waistline, covered in bold prints ranging from leopard to floral in an array of jewel tones and deep saturated colors.  With women swooning over his designs, Van Noten had men joining the bandwagon with the launch of his menswear collection in 1991. The same ethnical-world-traveller aesthetic from his womenswear collection was applied to men with the juxtaposition of different fabrics, prints and colors creating a contrast that is visually enticing and beatnik, but with restraint and an understated mode." rel="nofollow">dries van noten</a>

Hailing from Toronto, Dean and Dan Caten moved to New York in 1983 to study at the prestigious Parsons The New School for Design.  The Caten brothers eventually moved to Milan, Italy and worked as designers for the house of Gianni Versace and Diesel.  Their ultra-sexy and urban attire often pays tribute to their Canadian heritage, though they are now based out of Italy.  In 2002, Madonna asked the Caten brothers to design 150 pieces for her Drowned World Tour and in 2009, Dean and Dan designed the costumes for Britney Spears's much anticipated comeback tour.  The first Dsquared² flagship store opened in Milan in 2007.

Founded in 2001, many of their colorful ensembles are handmade and hand finished to the finest detailing.  Always shaking things up and treading away from the normal conventions of menswear, Duckie Brown's collections are often mismatched, clashing with their contradictory barbaric prints and color combinations.  The British and Canadian designers earned a nomination for the CFDA Menswear Designer of the Year award in 2007.

The Central Saint Martins graduate began honing in his craft while interning at Rick Owens.  Pugh caught the attention of major fashion editors with his graduate collection, featuring the use of balloons to accentuate the body, which would later become a signature of the London designer's.  His space-age meets sci-fi meets twenty-first century warriors aesthetic has many compare him to avant-garde masters like Martin Margiela and Rick Owens.  It could also only be a compliment when you are rumored to be the replacement at Dior Homme and of the late Lee Alexander McQueen.  His flamboyant designs have been loved by superstars like Kylie Minogue, Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.  In 2010, the first Gareth Pugh boutique was opened in Hong Kong.

Ferré's signature womenswear collection was launched in 1978 and menswear followed suit in 1982, while his couture collection was introduced in 1986.  Shape and structure were to be expected from the Italian designer, playing a dominant role in much Ferré's designs.  He was also known for his crisp lines and impeccable tailoring, with the white shirt becoming his signature piece.  In 1989, Ferré was appointed as the head designer of Christian Dior.   The engagement ended in 1997 and he was succeeded by John Galliano.  With the passing of Gianfranco Ferré in 2007, the Italian label was taken over by designers, Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi.  They remain true to the designs of the late Ferré, with geometric dresses for women and sharply tailored suits for men." rel="nofollow">gianfranco ferré</a>

The Armani brand expansion includes Privé, Collezioni, Jeans, and the latest, Armani Exchange.  In 2000, a new line of cosmetics and home furnishings were added to the list.

A young Audrey Hepburn became the muse of the French label, spanning a relationship that lasted over forty years.  After the retirement of Hubert in 1995, the house was succeeded by John Galliano.  But less than two years later, Galliano took reign at Christian Dior, prompting the hiring of Alexander McQueen, who was later succeeded by Julien MacDonald in 2001.  Givenchy resurfaced to prominence in 2005 with a much darker undertone with the appointment of a relatively unknown Riccardo Tisci.  Tisci's fetishistic demeanor and his fascination with goth struck a high note, attracting new attention and revitalized the Givenchy label.  Givenchy menswear was also given new life in 2005 under the helm of Ozwald Boateng.  The task ultimately fell upon Riccardo Tisci in 2009, who translated and infused his sleeker and darker themes from his women's collection over to men's.  " rel="nofollow">givenchy</a>

Lang was well known for his sharp tailoring and refined luxe.  His love of fetishism was prominent in his designs, featuring iconic pieces like leather harnesses over T-shirts and bondage pants.  His jeans collection became a phenomenon and a cult favorite, making up more than half of the brand's sales.  In 1999, Helmut Lang was acquired by Milan fashion house Prada, which led to the discontinuation of Helmut Lang Jeans and became the catalyst of Lang's departure in 2005. The popular 80's and 90's brand fell into a slump under the management of Prada and was consequently sold to Japan's Link Theory in 2006.  Helmut Lang was relaunched in 2007 under the helm of Nicole and Michael Colovos.  Though, the brand maintains its modern and minimalist roots, it is often not seen as a continuation of Helmut Lang's namesake label under the new creative direction.

His gender bending designs and theatrical presentations have given him the reputation of being the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of fashion.  He launched his first ready-to-wear collection in 1976 and it wasn't until 1997 that he launched his couture collection, which often references different religions and cultures.  Gaultier is known for using unconventional models on his runway such as older men and full-figured women, a contrary to the beauty idealized by the fashion world.  His menswear, which debuted in 1984, often promotes the cross-over between genders like tube tops and skirts for men.  In 1999, thirty-five percent the Jean Paul Gaultier label was purchased by Hermès, which led to the appointment of Gaultier at the French house in 2004.

Her signature clean lines, slim fitting tops and sharply cut pantsuits helped popularized the minimalist movement in the nineties.  Sander's understated elegance and high-end materials garnered her a cult following of critics and buyers, leading to a $200 million empire.  The label continued to find success with the launch of menswear in 1997.  Sander departed from her label in 2000 after 71 percent of the label was purchased by Prada Group in 1999.  However, she made a return in 2003 after a failed attempt to revive the label was made under the new creative direction of Milan Vukmirovic.  Sander revisited her minimalist aesthetic, though this time, more feminine and with splashes of colors, before officially ending her time with her namesake label in 2004 after four seasons.  Belgian designer Raf Simons came onboard as creative director in 2005, staying true to the heritage of the Jil Sander brand.  His take on menswear and womenswear are both conceptual and sculptural, with bold color blocking, exaggerated silhouettes and luxurious textiles.

Launched in 1854, the French house has become synonymous with its luxury goods and lifestyle.  Its signature canvas monogram, introduced in 1896, was actually created to prevent counterfeiting.  The famous pattern is now the ideal status symbol.  In 1987, Louis Vuitton merged with Moët et Chandon, becoming today's luxury powerhouse LVMH.  A decade later, Marc Jacobs was appointed creative director and created the first ever ready-to-wear collection for the French house.  Jacobs injected his personal touch to the label and has collaborated with artists such as Stephen Sprouse and Takashi Murakami to create limited collections.  Menswear was finally checked off the to-do list in 2000 under the reign of Jacobs and his studio director Paul Helbers.  Louis Vuitton remains one of the largest luxury goods company in the world." rel="nofollow">louis vuitton</a>

The designs were well beyond its time, adopting an avant-garde style that remains to be innovative and leading-edge till this day.  Despite his non-conventional designs, Margiela was appointed as the creative director of Hermès in 1997 and was succeeded by Jean Paul Gaultier in 2004, whom Margiela worked for from 1985 to 1987 before creating his eponymous label.  A couture line was added in 1997 and menswear in 1999. There is much mystery that surrounded the label and Margiela himself, who was rarely seen in the media or at the end of his runway shows.  His low profile earned him a cult status and his designs were worshipped upon.  His famous clothing tag, introduced in 1997, consists of the numbers 0-23, with each number containing a different meaning.  Margiela's departure from the avant-garde house was rumored and finally officially confirmed in December 2009, with no replacement creative director." rel="nofollow">maison martin margiela</a>

To coin the multiple CFDA Award winner (menswear, womenswear, and accessories) as multifaceted would simply be an understatement.  From 70's disco fever to 80's punk, the New York designer never fails to dazzle and delight when fashion week comes along and is a prominent fixture to the New York City fashion scene.  He unveiled his first menswear collection in 1994, with double breasted blazers and slim cut trousers as classic staples.  His diffusion line Marc by Marc Jacobs, launched in 2001, elevates the wardrobe of a younger customer that favors a more cheeky, mix-and-matched and breezy look that can translate from the workplace to cocktail hours.  It should be noted that a waitlist for the accessories is to be expected from the CFDA Accessories Award winning designer.  Since 1997, Jacobs has also been at the helm of the French luxury powerhouse Louis Vuitton.  " rel="nofollow">marc jacobs</a>

The anti-overt-sex-appeal label introduced a new way of dressing for women with their offbeat collections featuring the juxtaposition of textures, colors and patterns.  In 2002, Marni introduced its menswear collection favoring a more minimalist and streamlined aesthetic while retaining the idiosyncratic look known to the brand.  Bold graphics, contradictory fabric combinations and classic tailoring resonate through the men's designs.  In fall 2007, Marni produced leggings for men as standalone bottoms, kicking start a trend that would become very prominent in menswear a few seasons later.

Kors has built a career out of his renowned classic American sportswear that earned him the prestigious CFDA award in 1999.  His garments are classics rather than basic and pure rather than simple.  Kors understands luxury fundamentally in its most understated and versatile form.  His minimalistic approach to designing rejuvenated the French house, Celine, during his reign from 1997 to 2003.  The launch of his menswear collection in 2002 garnered Kors his second CFDA award.  In addition to his critically acclaimed ready-to-wear collections, Kors capitalized his commercial success with the launch of his diffusions lines in 2004, MICHAEL Michael Kors (handbags and footwear) and KORS Michael Kors (footwear and jeans).

Missoni is known for its eccentric knitwear often consisting of multiple patterns such as stripes, geometrics and abstract shapes in an array of colors and fabrics like wool, cotton, linen, rayon and silk.  The label has developed over 25 sub-lines aside from the main Missoni line, including M Missoni and Missoni Home.

Moschino consummates the smartness of prep and the edginess old school rock 'n' roll with perfection.  In 2006, Moschino designed the official outfits for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Turin.  The Italian house continued to gain brand recognition through designing the costumes for the tour of Kylie Minogue and Madonna.

The first women's ready-to-wear collection made its debut in 1989 and its opulence instantaneously caught the attention of the fashion world.  Prada's success reached new heights in the 90's and a sister line, Miu Miu, was launched along with a men's ready-to-wear collection.  Menswear is celebrated for its classic tailoring, bold prints and geometric cutting.  Today, the Prada collections are known for its quirk and its contradictory and juxtaposing themes.

To reach more clienteles, Raf by Raf Simons, a diffusion line was launched in 2005.  He also teamed up with Dr. Martens to create a much anticipated limited footwear collection.

He presented his first collection in New York in 2002 with the support of Anna Wintour, who later featured the designer in a spread in Vogue.  His menswear collection was launched the following season and it has since become a cult favorite.  After two seasons, Owens relocated to Paris from Los Angeles and his runway shows are among one of the most anticipated during fashion week.  His dark aesthetic has started a new sub-genre in fashion and has paved the way for new designers with similar vision.  The label expanded with more affordable lines, Lillies and DRKSHDW and in the summer of 2008, a furniture range was added to the empire of Rick Owens.

With nothing holding him back, Browne injected his sense of humor and wit into his collections, often breaking the limitations and standards set for menswear.  The Thom Browne man is not afraid to wear skirts, short shorts with bright red knee-high socks, yellow raincoats, and loves to roll up the hem of his pants.  Browne reinvents the classic American look with a dose of fun and eccentricity.  His whimsical and flamboyant creations stem from his playful inspirations that range from the perfect beach resort to the tennis court and even a circus freak show.  His trademark plaid prints and signature colors, red, white, blue, and grey, were translated into his much anticipated debut menswear-inspired womenswear collection for spring 2011." rel="nofollow">thom browne</a>

Founded by Gianni Versace, the Medusa-branded label epitomized over-the-top glamour with its loud prints and flashy colors.  Versace is now under the helm of Gianni's sister, Donatella, following his death in 1997.  Donatella oversees womenswear, menswear, as well as Versace Couture, Sport, and Jeans Couture.  Another diffusion line, Versus, founded in 1989 was resurrected by Donatella in 2009 after closing in 2005.  Versace is sought after for their thigh high slits and barely-there mini dresses.  For men, it's all about the sleek and masculine sex appeal.  The Versace empire remains a family affair and continues to expand with hotels in Australia and Dubai." rel="nofollow">versace</a>

The unpredictable designers met while studying at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design and launched their avant-garde label in 1993, showcasing the highest level of craftsmanship and showmanship.  Viktor and Rolf's imaginative and outlandish runway shows have included light fixtures attached to models while wearing traditional wooden Dutch clogs, stripping all their designs off one model while dressing another with the newly stripped away pieces and massive blocks of ruffled-gowns sliced and chopped to create a dreamy visual illusion.  While the womenswear collections are over-the-top and large scaled, Viktor and Rolf's menswear collections are understated and subtle but with charming detailing that sets them apart from others.  The Dutch duo reached out to the masses by collaborating with high street retailer H&amp;M in 2006, creating a one time collection featuring their signature looks." rel="nofollow">viktor &amp; rolf</a>

In 1970, along with the band Sex Pistols, Westwood opened the boutique Let it Rock in London, where she crafted her outlandish designs inspired from bikers and prostitutes, perfect for the fashion misfits.  The boutique, now World's End, remains to be owned by Westwood and continues to carry her collections.  She launched her first ready-to-wear collection in 1981 and has expanded into menswear and created two secondary lines.  Her rebellious and punk aesthetic revolutionized fashion during the 70's and the impact is still prominent today.  Westwood's love for theatricality has made her runway shows the place to be during fashion week.

Known for his avant-garde taste and aesthetic, Yamamoto creates the perfect marriage between dark romance, wit and historic references.  He launched his menswear collection in 1984 with the same grandeur and unconventional sex appeal as his womenswear.  The Japanese designer is never one to follow trends and is a master of oversize silhouettes, textured and voluminous suits, somber colors and dramatic drapery.  In addition to his high-end Yohji Yamamoto line and his original Y label, Yamamoto churned out a handful of diffusion lines, including the collaborative label Y-3 with Adidas, Y's Red Label, Limi Feu and an affordable range entitled Coming Soon.

The French luxury fashion house became the catalyst for women dawning on the the classic tuxedo, Le Smoking suit.  Saint Laurent also popularized safari jackets, shirt dresses, the beatnik look, and the iconic Mondrian dress.  He was recognized as one of the first designers to feature black models on his runway shows.  In 1993, Yves Saint Laurent was sold to a pharmaceutical company for $600 million before it was acquired by the Gucci Group in 1999.  Alber Elbaz took over as the creative director of the prêt-a-porter line Rive Gauche in 1998, while Saint Laurent remained as the designer of his couture collection until his retirement in 2002, which also marked the closing of the couture house.  After three seasons, Elbaz was succeeded by Tom Ford, who introduced a much sexier and provocative interpretation of the French house.  After the departure of Ford in 2004, Stefano Pilati was brought on as the new designer for Yves Saint Laurent, who returned to the roots of the label, favoring a more French style than Ford's heightened sexy appeal.
