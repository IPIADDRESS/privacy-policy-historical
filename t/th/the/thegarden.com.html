        Policy</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">At 
        Madison Square Garden, L.P. ("MSG"), we understand that privacy 
        is an important issue for visitors to websites. Specifically, Web users 
        are concerned about what information is being collected, how it's being 
        collected and how it is being used. The following information is designed 
        to help you understand MSG's Internet Privacy Policy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><br>
        <b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Parental 
        Consent Required for Personal Information Collected From Children Under 
        the Age of 13</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">MSG 
        cares about protecting the personal information of children and does not 
        collect nor use personal information voluntarily supplied without parental 
        consent of a child. Upon obtaining parental consent, MSG only shares this 
        information internally with its business units (the New York Knicks, the 
        New York Rangers, the Hartford Wolf Pack, the New York Liberty and Radio 
        City Entertainment) for purposes of providing special gift offerings, 
        ticket discounts, and conducting games and sweepstakes. The types of personal 
        information collected are (i) names; (ii) email address; (iii) age; (iv) 
        mailing address; (v) hobbies; (vi) sports and entertainment interests; 
        and (vii) telephone numbers. If a parent decides not to authorize the 
        online collection and/or use of such personal information, the child will 
        still be able to participate in such offerings, discounts, games and sweepstakes. 
        A parent may also elect to authorize the internal use of a child's personal 
        information, but not the external use of such data. Either way, MSG will 
        never collect more information from a child than is necessary for conducting 
        the aforementioned activities. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">If 
        at any time MSG decides to use such personal information with its sponsors, 
        partners or affiliates, it will not to do unless and until it obtains 
        verifiable consent from parents (e.g. requiring parents to fax a signed 
        consent form, or sending emails that only be opened with a PIN number 
        supplied upon extending parental consent). A parent may revoke previously 
        extended approval at any time. A parent may also authorize the collection 
        of his/her child's personal information for internal marketing purposes, 
        as described above, but not for disclosure to MSG's sponsors, partners 
        and affiliates. </font></p>
