However, in order to participate in certain activities or receive certain of our services (such as commenting on our blogs, downloading materials from the Website and subscribing to our newsletter), you will need to register on the Website and provider certain personally identifiable information. "Personally identifiable information" includes, for example, contact information and demographic information, such as the User's name, postal address, e-mail address, photograph and zip code. Some information may be required, such as a username, password, name and e-mail address, and other information (such as your postal address, photograph and avatar), may be voluntary. Personally identifiable information may also be collected from Users using a "contact us" or similar feature on the Website, when sending us an e-mail or in any other way contacting us through the Website.</p><br><p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We collect the browser type and IP address of all Site visitors. Our servers may also record the referring page that linked Users to the Site (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages Users visit on this Site; the Web site that Users visit after this Site; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings Users are using; any search terms Users have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.</p><br><p>We also store certain information from Users' browsers using cookies (small pieces of data stored on the User's computer). Cookies track where Users travel and what Users look at on the Web Site, and confirm when Users have logged in to the Site. A cookie may enable us to relate Users' use of the Website to other information about that User, including personally identifiable information. Cookies can be blocked or removed by a User through the use of browser settings. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude Users from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site. We also may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies in the Site and/or in our communications with you (such as in our e-mails), which help us to verify an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message, and may enable us to relate such viewing or receipt to other information, including personally identifiable information. Any or all of the above-described activities with respect to non-personally identifiable information may be performed on our behalf by our Service Providers (defined below).</p><br><p>Information Obtained from Third Parties: We may supplement the information obtained from you through the Website with information that is received or otherwise obtained from third parties.
