<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAST UPDATED: FEBRUARY 8, 2008</strong></p>
<p>As used herein, "Site" refers to theweekdaily.com and other sites on the World Wide Web originating in the United States which are owned and/or operated by The Week Publications, Inc. (collectively, "The Week"). By using this Site, you indicate your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you are not permitted to access this Site and you should not do so. </p>
<p>The Week reserves the right to change or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes or updates are effective immediately after The Week gives notice of the change or update, which The Week may do by posting on this Site, or by e-mail or conventional mail, and/or by any other means which provides reasonable notice. Your use of this Site after such notice is posted means that you accept these changes or updates.</p>
<p>The Week understands and respects your desire for privacy. To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p>We (both directly and through third parties) collect personally identifying information when you register for the online newsletter or our magazine-subscriber-only area, enter contests, or participate in other interactive online activities (e.g., surveys, chat rooms, games, or bulletin boards) throughout this Site. This personally identifiable information may include your name, street address, city, state, zip code, e-mail address, landline phone number, cell phone number, and other identifiers that permit the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. As described below, we may use such information to award prizes or, with your permission, for promotional and marketing purposes. We also collect non-personally-identifiable information (such as your IP address or domain, or about your use of this Site) both directly and through third parties, including through the use of Web beacons, for purposes of site administration and to compile aggregate information about usage of this Site.</p>
<p>Click here: <a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/privacy/sitecensus.htm"><strong> http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/privacy/sitecensus.htm</strong></a>, to learn more information about how we use a third party service to collect and use information on this Site.</p>
<p>You will be asked for your credit card information if you subscribe to The Week Magazine or buy any other product from this Site. Your credit card information, along with the personal identifying information you submit, is transferred to and used by third party financial institutions to verify the credit card numbers and to authorize the processing of the transaction. Be sure to review all privacy policies published by our third party service providers and contact them directly if you have questions as they may have privacy terms that differ from The Week's Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>This Site has implemented appropriate safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and to make proper use of the information that we collect. However, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal information, The Week cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide to us.</p>
<p>To unsubscribe from the theweekdaily.com newsletter and/or other electronic communications from The Week, reply to the e-mail newsletter with "UNSUBSCRIBE" (and only "UNSUBSCRIBE") in the subject line, or by following the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the e-mail. You can also unsubscribe from promotional and marketing e-mails that you receive from one of this Site's partners by typing "UNSUBSCRIBE" (and only "UNSUBSCRIBE") in the subject line in a reply to one of the partner's e-mails to you, or following the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the e-mail.</p>
<p>To change the address of your The Week Magazine subscription, or to provide any other subscription-related information to The Week, you may write to The Week, P.O. Box 420235, Palm Coast, FL 32142 or call 1-386-447-6312. </p>
<p><strong>POLICY FOR MINORS </strong></p>
<p>Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this Site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not knowingly provide any personally identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to third parties, nor is this information knowingly used by The Week for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not allowed to participate in contests on this Site. </p>
<p><strong>POLICY FOR ADULT GUESTS </strong></p>
<p>This Site collects personal information from guests over 18 years of age in order to provide guests with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. The Week may share the personal and aggregate information we collect with our affiliates and other sites operated by and for The Week. On a confidential basis, The Week may also share personal information with our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf (such as fulfilling orders or for general site administration purposes). The Week shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. If all or part of The Week Publications, Inc. or its affiliates are sold, merged, or is otherwise transferred to another entity, the information you have provided at the Site may be transferred to such entity as part of that transaction. We may also disclose personal information in response to legal process, such as a request by law enforcement, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the integrity of this Site if we believe that a guest has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful acts.</p>
<p>With the permission of guests 18 years or older, information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and, also with the permission of the guest, may be shared by us with companies that have agreed with The Week to use this information only for the marketing and promotion of its products and services. </p>
<p>If any individual submits content for publication, we may publish his or her name and any other information submitted by that individual. </p>
<p>If guests elect to use our "E-mail to a Friend" referral service for informing a friend about this Site, we ask for the friend's e-mail address, and we will send an e-mail in response to the guest's request inviting their friend to visit the Site. This information is stored at this Site solely for the purpose of sending the e-mail. </p>
<p><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, the â€œShine the Lightâ€ law, allows California residents to obtain a list of third parties to whom a business has disclosed personal information if it shares such information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, if a business adopts and discloses in its privacy policy a policy of not disclosing customersâ€™ personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that right.</p>
<p>As stated earlier in this Privacy Policy, personal information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes only with the guestâ€™s permission. Whenever a guest agrees to allow us to collect personal information, we provide the guest with an option to prevent such information from being shared for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties. Furthermore, you may exercise this cost-free option at any time by clicking on the link below:</p>
<p><strong>Opt-out </strong></p>
<p>Because this Site has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-in or opt-out of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with the third party list. </p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC FORUMS </strong></p>
<p>Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in chat rooms, message boards, or similar posting areas, the information can be reviewed and collected by anyone. Therefore, do not post any information that you do not want to be made available to the general public. The Week is not responsible for unsolicited communications that arise from your postings on this Site. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS FROM THIS SITE </strong></p>
<p>If you purchase a product from this Site, information may be collected from you, including your credit card and contact information, for transfer to and use by third party providers of the product. The Week does not retain this information. Unless otherwise stated, The Week does not have any responsibility in connection with such purchases and all transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of the product provider. Be sure to review the product provider's privacy policy and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from The Week's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p> We use third party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit this Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit the following web addresses:</p>

    <p>
    <strong>USE OF IP ADDRESSES </strong></p>
<p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you log on to the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address, so when a guest requests pages from this Site, our servers log the guest's IP address. The IP addresses of our guests are collected only for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf. We do not combine IP addresses with any personally identifying information, nor do we compile any session activity reports by IP address. </p>
<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES </strong></p>
<p>In cyberspace, cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. </p>
<p>Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're online. The use of cookies is an industry standard. You'll find them at most major Web sites. </p>
<p>We use cookies to help us see which areas are popular and which are not. This helps us to target ads based on guest interests, and also improve and update this Site based on such data as total number of guests and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. </p>
<p>A cookie allows us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to this Site, which in turn allows us to speed up your future activities at this Site. Similarly, the stores hosted by this Site usually use cookies to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting cookies do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you are a subscriber of The Week Magazine and have registered to access the subscriber-only portion of this Site, an identifying cookie will be placed on your computer. During future visits to this Site, we will only read and retrieve information that we set in a cookie during an earlier visit to this Site. </p>
<p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers on this Site as well. This Site does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to The Week's Privacy Policy. Advertisers do not have access to this Site's cookies.</p>
<p>The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. </p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of this Site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. </p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about The Week's Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may contact us at The Week, Privacy Policy, 55 West 39th Street, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10018.</p>
