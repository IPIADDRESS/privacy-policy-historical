						information that is collected pursuant to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and similar state and 
						federal laws. We will also collect the work you perform. We may also gather information about you 
						to improve the content on our Web site and in our product and for marketing, promotional, and other 
						reasonable commercial purposes. Such data may include information gathered when you first subscribe 
						to our service or respond to surveys or other requests for information. We do not collect personally

                  CompassLearning Campus
               </p>
               <p>
				  The CompassLearning Campus available at support.compasslearning.com ("Campus") is an online community of teachers, 
						administrators and other school personnel with active agreements with CompassLearning for support 
						of Odyssey and who have licenses to use Odyssey.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  The Campus is a place to discuss how to use Odyssey, tips &amp; tricks, integrating Odyssey into the classroom, etc.  
						The Campus is moderated by CompassLearning.  Posts do not require pre-approval, although inappropriate posts, 
						as determined in CompassLearning’s sole discretion, will be removed.  
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  You post content to the Campus at your own risk.  CompassLearning cannot control the actions of other users with 
						whom you may choose to share information.  Therefore, CompassLearning does not guarantee that the content you 
						post on the Campus will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.  Any personally identifiable information you 
						submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of the Campus, and could be used to send you unsolicited 
						messages.  CompassLearning is not responsible for the personally identifiable information or other content you 
						or other customers choose to post on the Campus.  Access to the Campus and all content posted or linked thereon 
						is provided "AS IS" and "WHEN AVAILABLE."  We reserve the right to edit or delete any content we deem, in our

				  Odyssey Community
               </p>
               <p>
				  The Odyssey Community available at www.compasslearningodyssey.com ("Odyssey Community") is a discussion forum that 
						is integrated into Odyssey and designed to accompany and compliment the Odyssey curriculum.  Access to the 
						Odyssey Community is limited to teachers, administrators and students in a particular class or school with 
						active agreements with CompassLearning for support of Odyssey and who have licenses to use Odyssey.  The 
						applicable teacher or administrator who creates a discussion thread, or assigns a CompassLearning-created thread, 
						is considered the "moderator" of that discussion and is solely responsible for defining and maintaining 
						appropriate behavior among participants.
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  The Odyssey Community provides multiple tools to help moderators manage participation.  Moderators may: approve 
						comments before posting, remove inappropriate posts, limit access to specific discussion threads, and set 
						student access to "read only".  A school or district may also choose to disable the Odyssey Community entirely. 
						CompassLearning is not responsible for the content or any Odyssey Community discussions. 
			   </p>
			   <p>
				  You post content to the Odyssey Community at your own risk.  CompassLearning cannot control the actions of other users 
						with whom you may choose to share information.  Therefore, CompassLearning does not guarantee that the content 
						you post on Odyssey Community will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.  Any personally identifiable 
						information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of the Odyssey Community, and could be 
						used to send you unsolicited messages.  Access to the Odyssey Community and all content posted or linked thereon 
						is provided "AS IS" and "WHEN AVAILABLE."  We reserve the right to edit or delete any content we deem, in our 
						sole discretion, to be inappropriate or offensive, and to deny comment or participation rights to you or other

                  How We Use Your Information
               </p>
               <p>
				  Except with respect to material posted on the Campus or the Odyssey Community, CompassLearning maintains 
						all student data, student educational information, and student files as confidential, which guards 
						the privacy of students and families. CompassLearning and/or contractors to CompassLearning use the 
						information collected for assessment (such as scoring), reporting, and other purposes as your school 
						system may require. We may aggregate information without identifying students for internal research 
						and generally to inform the public about the results achieved through the CompassLearning Odyssey Web 
						site. Except as otherwise provided herein, we do not sell or share our student database. We have 
						established strict security procedures designed to prevent personally identifiable student files from 
						unauthorized access. Authorized parties that have access to student information are limited to 
						CompassLearning employees and contractors, school districts and/or the student's immediate family with 
						proper request and identification. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Some information may pass through third-party suppliers of services (such as Web hosting services) 
						who have been engaged to assist in the delivery of the CompassLearning Odyssey product. In addition, 
						like any company, CompassLearning may acquire or be consolidated with other enterprises, and another 
						enterprise may assume the duties of CompassLearning and so have access to your personal information. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We may also share aggregated demographic information about our user base with other companies who market 
						our products.  This information does not identify individual customers and we do not link aggregate user 
						data with personally identifiable information. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and/or to 
						comply with judicial proceedings, government investigations, court orders, or legal process served on 
						us, as well as when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, investigate or prevent 
						fraud or other illegal activities or to prevent breach of CompassLearning’s Terms and Conditions of Use Policy.

                  Privacy Protection for Children
               </p>
               <p>
				  CompassLearning urges parents and guardians to discuss with their children restrictions regarding 
						the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know and to monitor their children's 
						Internet activities. We strive to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). 
						Please read this <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm" class="link">Privacy Policy</a> in its entirety to understand what personal information is collected 
						from children on our Web site and how we use such information. We have established and will maintain 
						reasonable procedures designed to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information 
						collected from children, although no assurances are provided.  
               </p>
               <p>
				  No part of our Web site is specifically structured to attract children under the age of 13, except 
						as a student under the guidance and supervision of an adult. Parental/Guardian consent is required 
						in order for any child under 13 years of age to submit personal information to the CompassLearning 
						Odyssey Web site, and before CompassLearning will use or disclose that personal information. Only 
						a parent or guardian may register a child for access to the CompassLearning Odyssey Web site.  
               </p>
               <p>
				  We will provide to a parent or guardian, upon proper request and identification, the following 
						information about their child: (a) a description of the specific types of personal information 
						collected from the child, and (b) the opportunity at any time to refuse to permit us further use 
						or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online collection of personal information from that 
						child. We request the parent or guardian send your request to 
						<a href="http://support.compasslearning.com" class="link">
						Customer Support</a>, by U.S. mail, or by facsimile with a sufficiently detailed request for 
						information or notice, referring to contact information below. Certain exceptions may apply to 
						the foregoing provisions, pursuant to COPPA and other applicable law.  
               </p>
               <p>
				  If you are a teacher, school administrator, tutor, or similar party entering information about 
				  children, you represent that you have proper authority to submit the child's personal 
				  information and you agree to hold harmless CompassLearning from any and all claims relating to the 
				  acceptance and use of such information.
