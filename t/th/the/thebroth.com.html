<h1>Privacy Policy - TheBroth.com</h1>

<p><em>
TheBroth.com ("TheBroth") takes your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
</em></p>

<div class="q_a">
<h2>1. What information does TheBroth collect?</h2>
<p>
TheBroth collects only the information required to provide you with
access to services offered by TheBroth. Participating as an anonymous
player in any of TheBroth's rooms does not require you to provide
TheBroth with any personal information. Visitors to TheBroth who wish to
sign up as a member of TheBroth need only provide TheBroth with
a contact email address.
</p>

<h2>2. What is TheBroth's practice regarding cookies?</h2>
<p>
Cookies stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit
to TheBroth. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit
TheBroth, although viewing or participating in any of TheBroth rooms
requires cookies. Cookies alone do not give us any personally
identifiable information about you. By adjusting your browser settings,
you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected.
</p>
<p>
We also automatically receive and record information from our servers
and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit
to pages on TheBroth, and information about the pages you visited. This
information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be
matched with any personally identifiable information about you.
</p>
<p>
We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>Keeping count of return visits to our site;</li>
   <li>Accumulating and reporting anonymous statistical information on web site and advertisement usage;</li>
   <li>Keeping track of registered users' preferred settings. </li>
</ol>

<p>
TheBroth allows other companies to display advertisements on our site,
and these ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads
placed by third parties are collected by TheBroth advertisers or their
affiliates, and TheBroth does not have access to or control over this
information. Unless you visit the web site of these companies and
provide them with personally identifiable information about yourself,
these tracking technologies tell those advertisers nothing about who you
are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is subject to their own
privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>3. How does TheBroth use the information?</h2>
<p>We use the information we gather for three general purposes:</p>
<ol>
   <li>To determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to improve TheBroth's services;</li>
   <li>To fulfill your requests for certain services, such as allowing you to create personalized TheBroth rooms;</li>
   <li>To send you information regarding changes to TheBroth's services. </li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Does TheBroth share the information?</h2>
<p>
TheBroth will not share your personally identifiable information with
other companies or people. 
</p>
<p>
TheBroth may share personally identifiable information if and when we
are required to do so by law, such as in the case of responding to
subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.
</p>

<h2>5. Privacy practices relating to registered members and their profiles</h2>
<h3>5a. Publishing information</h3>
<p>
As a registered member, you have the option (but not the obligation) to customize your forum profile, post in the forum,
write in user blogs, comment on artworks and blog entries, and you're
encouraged not to share personally identifiable information when doing
so. Please review our <a href="/safety.html">safety tips and
guidelines</a>.
</p>
<h3>5b. Contests</h3>
<p>
If you opt to enter an art competition and you win and wish to claim
your prize, you may be required to disclose your name and mailing
address. This is completely optional - we do not have your name or
address on file, and it is your choice as to whether you wish to
disclose this information to TheBroth or the contest sponsors upon
winning a prize. Please refer to our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of
Service</a> for the rules governing contests.
</p>

<h3>5c. Online indicators and public profile information</h3>
<p>
As a member, when you are online at TheBroth, every visitor to TheBroth can see
whether you're online by means of a flashing online indicator icon displayed
behind your username. Every visitor to TheBroth can also view your
profile and view information about your user history, including the date when you
joined, how often you visited, to how many and which snapshots you have contributed,
and how many and which snapshots you have submitted to the public
gallery. Based on the tags that other users or yourself are adding to
your artworks, a certain "style" may be displayed on your profile,
indicating the tags that your artworks are most frequently associated
with. Every visitor to TheBroth will be able to read your forum posts, blog
entries and comments on blog entries and artworks. Every visitor to
TheBroth will also be able to see in which mosaic room you were last and
the date or time of that visit. You have the option to only visit your
own hidden room, in which case the "last mosaic room" information will
be hidden from all other users on TheBroth.
</p>

<h3>5d. Friends list</h3>
<p>
You are able to accept, ignore or reject friend requests, and you can
remove other users from your friends list at any time. Members of
TheBroth that you accept as friends will be able to view the last page
you have viewed and the time associated with the last page view.
</p>

<h3>5e. Chat</h3>
<p>
Members at TheBroth can communicate in mosaic rooms via a chat system.
All chat messages are being logged. We do not monitor the chat but we
reserve the right to look up previous chat conversations in the context
of dispute resolution. We will not disclose any information in the chat
log other than if required to do so by law, such as in the case of
responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.
</p>

<h2>6. What are my options</h2>
<p>
Users who would rather not provide the data requested by our
registration process (ie. a valid email address and password) do not
need to register with TheBroth. You can still participate anonymously in
TheBroth experience without registering.
</p>

<h2>7. How can I review and update my personally identifiable information?</h2>
<p>
TheBroth does not store personally identifiable information other than
your email address. You can <a href="http://www.thebroth.com/unregister.html">unregister</a> which will
delete your account, and it will remove your name from gallery comments
you may have made and from artworks you may have contributed to. Your
posts in the forum will remain visible and continue to display your
username. If you are experiencing problems with our services or you have
questions about how our services work, you can contact us via our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.
</p>

<h2>8. How is my information secured?</h2>
<p>
TheBroth has security measures in place, such as routine backups and
administrator-only server access, in order to prevent the loss, misuse
or alteration of personal information under our control.
