<b>The Daily Plate Privacy Policy</b>

<b>Effective
Date: May 8, 2008</b>
<br><br>Your
privacy is important to The Daily Plate ("The Daily Plate", "we" or "us").
This
Privacy and Information Security Policy ("the Policy") discusses the
personally identifying information ("PII") that we collect about you when you
use our website <a href="http://www.thedailyplate.com/">http://www.thedailyplate.com</a>
(the "Site") and the other services we provide on or through the Site (together
with the Site, the "Service").
This Policy is part of and incorporated into <a href="/tou">The
Daily Plate Terms of Use</a> (collectively, the "Terms").

<br><br>Policy
highlights:
<ul>
<li>We will not collect PII about
you through the Service unless you disclose such information to us;</li>
<li>We will not knowingly disclose
PII about you that we collect through the Service to third parties, except
under the limited circumstances described in this Policy; and</li>
<li>We will take reasonable steps
to protect the security of the PII we collect from you through the Service.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>These
Policy highlights are qualified in full by reference to the terms described
below.
<br><br><b>BY
PROVIDING PII OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO
THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE POLICY.</b>
<br><br><b>1.
</b><b><u>INFORMATION
YOU GIVE US</u></b>.
<br><br>a.
<u>The
Types of Information The Daily Plate Collects</u>.
We collect any information
you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email,
survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how
you use our Service.
Our account registration process requires that you
provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and that you create
and provide us with a password.
We may also request other information, such as
but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code.
You
may access and update certain of your personal information or account settings by
going to the "Profile" tab on the Site.
<br><br>b.
<u>Information
in Public Areas of the Site</u>.
Please keep in mind that whenever you
voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service, such as the
user profile pages or forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used
by others.
We therefore advise visitors not to disclose contact information,
including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger
address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share.
We are not
responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.
Also, we may
highlight content you post to the public areas of the Service such as reviews
or comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site’s home page.

<br><br>c.
<u>Minors</u>.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register.
If you are under
13, do not attempt to register for our Site or send any information about
yourself to us.
We recommend that prospective users between the ages of 13 and
17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission before sending any
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
<br><br><b>2.
</b><b><u>AUTOMATIC
INFORMATION COLLECTION</u></b>.

<u>Cookies</u>.
Like many websites, we use "cookies."
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers
that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser.

cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.

you access the Internet and the Internet address</div></center></center></body></html>
