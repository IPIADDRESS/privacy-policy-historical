APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to let individuals know, generally, what sort of personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, uses, and discloses that information.      <br><br>     <b>Principle 6: Access and correction</b>     <br><br>     Where APN Newspapers Pty Ltd holds personal information about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the information on request, in a form or manner suitable to the individual's reasonable needs, except to the extent that: <br>     a) providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; or<br>     b) providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or<br>     c) the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or<br>     d) the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or<br>     e) providing access would reveal the intentions of APN Newspapers Pty Ltd in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or<br>     f) providing access would be unlawful; or<br>     g) denying access is specifically authorised by law; or<br>     h) providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or<br>     i) providing access would be likely to prejudice:<br>     (i) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal   offences; or<br>     (ii)  breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction<br>      (iii) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;<br>      (iv)  the protection of the public revenue;<br>      (v)  the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper     conduct; or<br>     (v) preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or    implementation of its orders; by or on behalf of an enforcement agency; or<br>     (j) an enforcement agency performing a lawful security function asks APN Newspapers Pty Ltd not to provide access on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the national security of Australia.<br>     <br><br>     Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within APN Newspapers Pty Ltd in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd may give the individual an explanation for the decision, rather than direct access to the information.      <br><br>     Wherever direct access by the individual is impractical or inappropriate, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and the individual should consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.      <br><br>     If APN Newspapers Pty Ltd levies charges for providing access to personal information, those charges:<br>     a) will not be excessive; and<br>     b) will not apply to lodging a request for access.     <br><br>     If APN Newspapers Pty Ltd holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date.      <br><br>     If the individual and APN Newspapers Pty Ltd disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the individual asks APN Newspapers Pty Ltd to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to do so.      <br><br>     APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will provide reasons for denial of access or correction.      <br><br>     <b>Principle 7: Identifiers</b>     <br><br>     APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier that has been assigned by a government agency (or by an agent of, or contractor to, a government agency acting in its capacity as agent or contractor).      <br><br>     <b>Principle 8: Anonymity</b>     <br><br>     Whenever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the option of not identifying themselves when dealing with APN Newspapers Pty Ltd.      <br><br>     <b>Principle 9: Transborder data flows</b>     <br><br>     APN Newspapers Pty Ltd will not transfer personal data outside Australia unless:<br>     (a) APN Newspapers Pty Ltd reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a statute, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair information handling that are substantially similar to these rules; or<br>     (b) the individual concerned consents to the transfer; or<br>     (c) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual concerned and APN Newspapers Pty Ltd, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in respect to the individual's request; or<br>     (d) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual concerned between APN Newspapers Pty Ltd and a third party; or<br>     (e) the transfer is for the benefit of the individual concerned; and<br>     (i) it is not practicable to obtain the consent of the subject of the information to that transfer; and<br>     (ii) if it were practicable to obtain such consent, the subject of the information would be likely to give it; or<br>     (f) APN Newspapers Pty Ltd has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be collected, held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with these rules.     <br><br>     <a name="item3"></a><b>What personal information we collect?</b>     <br><br>     Online Forms<br>     When submitting information on our website, we will collect details such as your name, email and phone number.
