        <p>
            The following policy applies to SCHOLASTIC.COM and any other site owned and/or operated by or on behalf of Scholastic
            Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, that states that it is governed by this Privacy Policy and/or links to this Privacy Policy (the sites
            and entities collectively referred to herein as "Scholastic.com" and/or "Scholastic" respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
            Scholastic is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. This policy statement provides our visitors
            (e.g., parents, teachers, librarians, and children) with an overview of the measures we have taken to provide a safe online
            environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to our online practices only, except the Opt-Out procedure below also applies to our offline
            collection of personal information.
        </p>
        <h2>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </h2>
        <p>
            We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable information: first and last name, e-mail address,
            street address and phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
            We (and/or our agents or affiliates) may collect online and use personally identifiable information from our adult visitors: (1) to
            process and fulfill orders for products or services (such as our magazines); (2) in connection with contests, sweepstakes,
            games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content submissions, classroom activities, our requests for suggestions
            and visitors' requests for information; and (3) to customize the content on our site for our visitors' current and future needs. In
            addition, this personally identifiable information may be used to provide our visitors, via e-mail or other means, information
            about materials and activities that may be of interest to them, including products or services of third parties. For these
            reasons, we may share such information with third parties. If you are an individual who has provided us with your personal
            information online or offline and you do not want us to share your information with third parties, or if there is a media
            notification that you no longer wish to receive from us, please let us know by sending us your name, address, e-mail and
            phone number at: Opt-Out Request, Scholastic Inc., 557 Broadway â€” Room 4010, New York, NY 10012. If you are writing to
            request that you no longer receive a particular media notification from us, please include the name of the media notification. In
            addition, in every e-mail that we send, we provide a link that you can click on to enable you to opt out of receiving future e-
            mails from the sender.
        </p>
        <h2>FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS</h2>
        <p>
            There are many activities on the Scholastic site that children can participate in and enjoy without having to share personally
            identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those activities that require personally identifiable information, such as contests and sweepstakes, in compliance with the
            Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Scholastic will not condition a child's participation in an
            activity on that child disclosing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to administer the activity.
            For certain online activities, we may require verifiable parental consent before collecting or using personally identifiable
            information from children under the age of 13. With these activities, Scholastic will notify the respective parent of our privacy
            policy and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personally identifiable information from the child, unless we
            collect only the child's name and online contact information to: (1) obtain parental consent or provide parents with notice; (2)
            respond directly on a one-time basis to a child's specific request; (3) respond more than once to a child's specific request
            along with providing parental notice of such use; (4) protect the safety of a child; or (5) comply with legal requirements. When
            we provide parents with notice and/or seek consent, we also give parents the ability to let us know if they do not want any
            further use made of the personally identifiable information we have collected from their child. Parents can request to review or
            have deleted their child's personally identifiable information from Scholastic's records, and refuse to permit further use of a
            child's personally identifiable information by writing to us at: e-Scholastic, 557 Broadway, New York, New York 10012, Re:
            Parent's Request for Information. Parents can also print, complete and return
            <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/inforequest/index.htm" class="external">this letter</a> to the specified address.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless we indicate otherwise and obtain prior parental consent, personally identifiable information collected from children
            under the age of 13 will be used solely by Scholastic, co-operators of any customized features on our site or Scholastic's
            agents for internal purposes and will not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is Scholastic's policy never to post on its site more than a child's first name, first initial of last name, state, and age or grade.
        </p>
        <h2>FOR TEACHERS</h2>
        <p>
            There are many activities on the Scholastic site that are for teachers, which enable teachers to add another dimension to their
            classroom and students' activities. In order to create such online classroom activities, we will collect personally identifiable
            information from teachers and have teachers provide a password to their students so that students can publish materials
            online and do other activities online in connection with their class through the use of such password. We will only enable such
            passwords with the verifiable consent provided by teachers acting on behalf of parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            A teacher may revoke the consent she has provided on behalf of her students' parents, or inquire about personally identifiable
            information that has been collected from a student by writing to us at: e-Scholastic, 557 Broadway, New York, New York
            10012, Re: Teacher's Request for Information. Teachers can also print, complete and return
            <a href="http://scholastic.com/inforequest/tchrequest.htm" class="external">this letter</a> to the specified
            address.
        </p>
        <p>
            When teachers register with our site, we use their sign-in information, which contains personally identifiable information, to
            ensure that only the teacher who has signed in has access to his or her personal areas of the site. For example, only
            registered teachers are permitted to administer Class Homepages. Access to administer a teacher's Class Homepage is
            controlled via that teacher's personal username and password, which was established during the registration process.
        </p>
        <h2>FOR KIDS</h2>
        <p>
            Remember to be smart online. Do not give out your full name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number or any other
            personal information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or
            guardian for permission. Sometimes on our Scholastic site we will ask you for your first name and e-mail address along with
            your parents' e-mail address. We do this so that we can contact your parents to let them know that you have communicated
            with us, and that we have collected this information from you.
        </p>
        <h2>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
            We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of a software technology called "cookies," and through our
            visitors' voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request. By non-personally identifiable information, we are referring to
            information about our visitors' browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), operating systems (e.g., Windows or
            Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) and other similar information which we track in aggregate
            form. We also collect the following non-personally identifiable information in connection with content submissions, games,
            classrooms, and bulletin boards: first name only and first initial of last name, state, age, and grade. The non-personally
            identifiable information that we track is anonymous and will never be identified with or lead us back to any of our visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookie technology helps us to know how many people visit us and where visitors go on our site. Cookies are small bits of
            information we send to your computer. Among other things, this non-personally identifiable information allows us to know
            which areas are favorites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what technologies and Internet services are being used
            by our visitors so that we may continually improve our visitors' online experiences.
        </p>
        <h2>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</h2>
        <p>
            We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of Scholastic.com. An IP address is a number assigned to
            your computer by a Web server when you're on the Web. When you are on our site, we have a back-end server that logs your
            computer's IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how
            many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However,
            we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply
            with legal requirements.
        </p>
        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
            Scholastic ensures that all personally and non-personally identifiable information that it receives via the Internet is secure
            against unauthorized access. This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the
            Internet. This means that no eyes but ours will ever see the information that our visitors send to us, unless we indicate
            otherwise. We will give out personal information as required by law, for example to comply with a court order or subpoena or
            to assist in criminal investigations. We may also give out personal information when we deem it advisable in order to protect
            the safety and security of our sites and visitors to our sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why are we so safe?</strong><br>
            Scholastic uses secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line to protect your credit card information. It
            encrypts all of your personal and credit card information so that this information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering
            system, and once it is received, it is stored in a location not accessible via the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>More Guarantee Details</strong><br>
            Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized charges. If your bank
            does hold you liable for any of this $50, Scholastic will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. Note that, in the
            event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules
            and procedures.
        </p>
        <h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>
        <p>
            Visitors will find links from Scholastic.com to independently owned, controlled and/or managed World Wide Web or Internet
            sites whose content we have found of possible interest to our visitors. In many cases, but not always, the links represent
            cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. While we initially visit these
            sites to which we directly link, please note that we do not monitor or control the content that appears on these sites and such
            content may be constantly changing. We recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking off to
            any new sites, and we encourage all end users of Scholastic.com to read the privacy policies of all linked sites before
            navigating through them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that we may revise our above policy without notice to users as the content on our sites continues to change and
            we will post all such material changes on this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope that you enjoy exploring our sites.
