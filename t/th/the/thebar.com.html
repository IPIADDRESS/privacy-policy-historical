<h2>11. Portfolio permissions</h2>

<p>If you have given permission to receive communications about Diageo brands generally (for example, by opting to receive news and special offers by email about Diageo's other great alcohol brands), you may from time to time receive communications about brands to which you have not opted in specifically. Information about many of Diageo's brands can be found at <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com">www.diageobrands.com.</a></p>

<p>We occasionally may send you communications about brands not featured on <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com">www.diageobrands.com.</a> (e.g., new brands). We recommend that you refer to <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com">www.diageobrands.com.</a> from time to time as the list of featured brands will be updated periodically.</p>

<p>Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does not mean that you will receive communications about all of Diageo's brands. We will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo brands.</p>

<p>If you have any privacy-related questions, concerns or complaints, please contact: Data Privacy Officer, Corporate Centre Legal Team, Diageo plc, Lakeside Drive, London, NW10 7HQ, United Kingdom.</p>
