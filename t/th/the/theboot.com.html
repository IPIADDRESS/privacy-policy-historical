A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Website(s) that is saved on your hard drive by your computer's browser. Cookies help us remember you when you return to the Website(s). Cookies also hold information to personalize and enhance your experience and to gather Website(s) statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the Internet provider's domain name and the addresses of the sites you visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving the Website(s).  The information in the cookies lets us trace your “clickstream” activity (i.e., the paths taken by users of the Website(s) as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve you by revealing which portions of the Website(s) are the most popular. We may also allow our affiliate and service providers and advertisers to serve cookies from the Website(s) to allow them to assist us in various activities such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of the Website(s), its content and advertising.

We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.  </p><p data-reactid="220">5.4	Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools that we may use on the Website(s) may collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Website(s).  This information may include your computer's Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website(s) you visited immediately before coming to the Website(s). Cookies, pixel tags, and/or other analytical tools in our emails may also be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.  We may also work with businesses that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Website(s) and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. </p><p data-reactid="221">5.5	We may combine the NPII collected through cookies, pixel tags and other analytical tools with other information we may have collected from you. This information may be used to improve the Website(s), to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of advertising, and for other internal business purposes.  We may use and share aggregated and anonymous information to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves and/or for our business partners. Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our service providers in order for them to perform services to or for us.  </p><p data-reactid="222">5.6	Ads appearing on the Website(s) may be delivered to users by Townsquare or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows us or our partners to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Townsquare and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p><p data-reactid="223">5.7	We authorize certain service providers to utilize NPII for their business purposes and in accordance with their privacy policies, such as to report on usage or industry trends to their customer base. </p><p data-reactid="224">5.8 	Third Party Functionalities: The Website(s) contains links to and/or enables certain third-party functionalities to enhance your experience on the Website(s), including social plug-ins, tools and APIs.
