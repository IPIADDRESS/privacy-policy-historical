				<p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on November 15, 2012. </p>
<p>We are committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to our website. This Privacy Policy explains how TheHousingForum.com (the “Site”), uses your personal information, and it applies to all users of the Site. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. </p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our personal information practices. It is your responsibility to check for revisions; anytime we revise this Privacy Policy, we will change the revision date at the top of this document. Please contact us with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT OR STORE</strong></p>
<p>If you use the Site, we may transmit, collect and store certain limited information. We collect the IP address used to access the Site along with the dates and times of access. Any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information of users.</p>
<p>We also store on the Site any personal information you choose to include, for example in your forum posts or comments to articles. You may control this information by not including it or removing it at your discretion.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES AND OPTING OUT</strong></p>
<p>We also use cookies as a means to collect information about Site usage automatically. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. </p>
<p>Specifically, TheHousingForum.com uses Google as a third-party vendor to serve advertisements on the Site. Google uses the Doubleclick DART cookie to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Site and other websites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>The collection of IP addresses is done so we may analyze trends, administer and improve the Site, track users movement and gather broad demographic information for internal use. We may also use information to protect against or identify violations of the terms and conditions of the Site, unauthorized use, claims and other liabilities, and manage risk exposure, including by identifying potential hackers and other unauthorized users. Information may also be used to understand your needs and interests and identify products, services, offers, events and promotions that may be of interest to you. </p>
<p>We may also use the information to comply with any applicable legal requirements (see the following section).  </p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION WE SHARE</strong> </p>
<p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about you except as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>We may share the information we collect with parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies; third parties offering services or information in which you have indicated your interest; any service providers who perform services on our behalf; and other third parties, with your specific consent. Any service providers with whom we may share information are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information we share with them except as necessary to perform the services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>We also may disclose information about you without obtaining your consent or offering you an opportunity to opt out (i) if we are required to do so or believe to be required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent or defend against misuse of the Site’s services, violation of our intellectual property rights, violation of our Terms and Conditions, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. </p>
<p>We also may transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
<p>We can better provide you services to match your interests by using limited information as described above, but there are ways you can limit our access to your information completely or in part. If you want us to stop using your personal information, you may discontinue using the Site for all purposes. You may also limit your personal information on the Site by using discretion in what you choose to post to the Site; remember that information posted on the Site is public.</p>
<p>Also note that most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies. Refer to the privacy and security settings in your browser you use to determine and manage the options. Please note, however, that by disabling or limiting cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Site features. Also note that you may opt out of the DART cookie and explained above.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and do not target the Site to children under 13. If we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any stored personal information about the user.  </p>
<p><strong>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong></p>
<p>The Site may provide links to third-¬party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the Site. We do not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from our practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal information you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third-¬party websites is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information through their websites.</p>
