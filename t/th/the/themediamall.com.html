    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We at MediaMall Technologies take privacy seriously. We would never sell any of your private information. Any sensitive information that you provide to us will be protected and never disseminated to other third parties. We do use private information to sell and deliver our PlayOn Service, and the Privacy Policy described here governs our use of that information.<br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding privacy at MediaMall Technologies, you should first contact our Privacy Office via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@themediamall.com">privacy@themediamall.com</a>.</p>
<h2>About MediaMall Technologies and the information we collect</h2>
<p>MediaMall Technologies (MMT) has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our dedication to protecting your personal information and informing you about how we handle it. This Privacy Policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on websites or through software managed by MMT. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time.</p>
<h2>Information Collected</h2>
<h4>Your Personally Identifiable Information:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Our blog, forum, newsletter, and trial registration forms require you to give us certain information such as your name, email address and password. You may always choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content.
</li><li>You may also enter usernames and passwords for use to access your accounts on other services via PlayOn (Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube, as examples).
</li><li>If you place an order for one of our products, you may be required to enter your credit card number and information, as well as your address and/or other contact information.
</li></ul>
<h4>Cookies:</h4>
<p>MediaMall Technologies wants to optimize your experience by ensuring that the most relevant information, searches and offers are displayed to you while using the Site. A common manner in which to do this is by placing cookies on your computer. Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when you visit the Site, and which may be correlated with your Personally Identifiable Information in our log files.</p>
<h4>Pixel Tags: </h4>
<p>MMT uses pixel tags to gather information about the emails we send to our users. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded email messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's computer will access our email provider’s server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with your email address, the date and time the recipient viewed the message, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may see or read cookies. For more information about cookies and how to disable their use, see the section below on "Use of Cookies."</p>
<h4>User Names and Passwords to Third-Party Sites:</h4>
<p>Any passwords to third-party sites that you provide will be stored encrypted on your local PC, and will only be used in secure channel communication with the respective sites. We will never ask for your login information to third-party sites, nor will this information be sent to our servers.</p>
<h4>Tracking:</h4>
<p>Our software sends installation tracking to our servers, which is used to calculate the raw total numbers of licensed and trial installations of our products. License keys for licensed installations are also validated by our server.</p>
<h4>Support Requests:</h4>
<p>Support requests send a copy of diagnostic logs that enable us to assess the problem you are having. These logs contain binary data about your PlayOn installation. The information in these logs includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC information: operating system version, CPU, RAM, free HDD space, security software status, etc.
</li><li>Basic UPnP communication information with the DLNA device(s).
</li><li>Video playback attempts and their timestamps, as well as playback status (errors, serve rates, etc.).
</li><li>Usernames for Netflix and Hulu accounts (not the respective passwords)
</li></ul>
<p>Without this information, we cannot support your PlayOn installation.</p>
<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<h4>Use of Personally Identifiable Information by MediaMall Technologies:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We use the collected Personally Identifiable Information to verify you and to contact you in connection with your transactions, postings and other activities on the Site, to send you product updates and announcements and for general corporate communications.
</li><li>MMT uses your Personally Identifiable Information to help us provide you with personalized content, advertising, and commercial messages (collectively, "Content").
</li><li>MMT does not sell, share or otherwise provide any "Personally Identifiable Information" you give to us unless required by law, court order or as required to technically operate the service, or to complete a transaction or order.
</li><li>MMT does reserve the right to share your Personally Identifiable Information with its parent, subsidiary or affiliated entities.
</li></ul>
<h4>When We May Disclose Your Personally Identifiable Information, MMT Communications Content, Data and Information:</h4>
<p>MMT may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or the contents of your private communications if required to do so by law or court order. Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be disclosed if necessary in order to complete a transaction such as the fulfillment of an order or purchase placed by you. </p>
<p>MMT will in no way disclose the contents of your MMT communications other than to the intended recipient(s) unless required (1) by law or court order, (2) to protect MMT's rights and property, (3) to protect against unauthorized use of the Site or Service, and (4) during emergencies such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk. </p>
<p>It is possible that as we continue to develop the PlayOn Service and business, MMT and/or related assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. </p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>This site has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and integrity of the information under our control. </p>
<p>Our credit card transaction data is processed and stored by PayPal – a third party website with TRUSTe certification and its own stringent privacy policies. To review PayPal’s privacy policies, please visit <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside" title="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside">http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside</a>.</p>
<h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<h2>Other Websites or Links</h2>
<p>This Website contains hyperlinks to other websites. MMT is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>
<h2>Opt-Out/Correct/Delete/Deactivate</h2>
<p>You may elect not to receive future communications from MMT or to discontinue use of our Service. </p>
<h2>Notification Procedures</h2>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our customers or web site Users, via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the relevant MMT website or as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our customers or web site Users.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>MMT reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at its sole discretion. If we make any substantive changes to the policy in the future with regard to how we use your information, we will notify you as described above.</p>
