	<b>PRIVACY POLICY</b>
	
	<p>
	
	Thank you for visiting
	TheWB.com, a Time Warner site. Your privacy is important to us. To better
	protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information
	practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is
	collected and used at this Time Warner site.
	
	</p><p>
	
	<b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
	
	</p><p>
	
	At some Time Warner sites,
	you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an
	opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or
	participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally
	identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name,
	address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information,
	and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs,
	and services.
	</p><p>
	At some other Time Warner
	sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might
	submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card
	and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you
	might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally
	identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these
	pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
	</p><p>
	At certain parts of some of
	our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally
	identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services
	or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.
	</p><p>
	We also may collect certain
	non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages
	such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer),
	the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and
	the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online,
	Earthlink).
	</p><p>
	<b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</b>
	</p><p>
	We may use the information
	you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs,
	and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer
	you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to
	you.
	</p><p>
	We sometimes use this
	information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won
	one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to
	fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your
	account with us.
	</p><p>
	We use the information that
	you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From
	time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs,
	or services to them.
	</p><p>
	The information we collect
	in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an
	interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in
	these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you
	products, programs, or services.
	</p><p>
	If you choose to submit
	content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may
	publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us.
	</p><p>
	We sometimes use the
	non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design
	and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet
	experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site
	usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.
	</p><p>
	We may disclose personally
	identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response
	to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in
	response to a law enforcement agency's request.
	</p><p>
	Agents and contractors of
	Time Warner who have access to personally identifiable information are required
	to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
	Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to
	carry out the services they are performing for Time Warner.
	</p><p>
	Although we take
	appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
	information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that
	we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this
	Privacy Notice.
	</p><p>
	Certain Time Warner sites
	may disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose practices
	are not covered by this privacy notice (e.g., other marketers, magazine
	publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations)
	that want to market products or services to you. If a site shares personally
	identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or
	block such uses. For instructions on how to opt out from such disclosures,
	please <a href="/Shows/Special/0,11116,17016||,00.html">click here</a>.
	</p><p>
	Time Warner may on occasion
	combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our
	ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to
	you. 
	</p><p>
	Finally, Time Warner sites
	will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in
	ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an
	opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.
	</p><p>
	Some of our sites contain
	links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours.
	Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control
	over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
	</p><p>
	Time Warner sites sometimes
	may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is
	sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these
	relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information
	that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. Time
	Warner has no control over these third-parties' use of this information. The
	Time Warner site will notify you at the time of requesting personally
	identifiable information if these third-parties will obtain such information.
	</p><p>
	Some Time Warner sites may
	use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may
	see at its Web pages. Our privacy policy does not cover any use of information
	that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. For more information
	on this site's use of such third-party ad servers, please <a href="/Shows/Special/0,11116,17035%7C%7C,00.html">click here</a>.
	</p><p>
	<b>COOKIES</b>
	</p><p>
	To enhance your experience
	with our sites, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text
	files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies,
	by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally
	identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us
	by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to
	furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may
	be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 
	</p><p>
	We use cookies to
	understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites.
	For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages
	(e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your
	password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on
	our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or
	services.
	</p><p>
	<b>OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY </b>
	</p><p>
	We have put in place
	appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
	help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the
	information we collect online.
</p><p>
