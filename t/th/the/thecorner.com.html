<td valign="top" width="900">Your personal data is collected and processed by YOOX USA for purposes which are strictly connected to the use of the US Site, its services and the purchase of products on the US Site. However, your personal data may also be used for other processing operations within the limits of such purposes. <br>In particular, your personal data may be processed for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>when you register with the US Site we collect your personal data (for example, your personal information, password, e-mail address, gender, favorite designer) through the relevant registration form (My Corner) in order to provide you with services in reserved access areas of the US Site and in order to send you our Newsletter, when specifically requested; </li>
<li>when you request Customer Care services, we collect your personal data (for example, your password) for purposes strictly necessary to provide you with customer care services relevant to the US Site and to the purchase of products on the US Site; </li>
<li>when you are executing purchasing procedures for products sold on the US Site, including conclusion of an agreement for the purchase of products, we collect your personal data (for example, personal information, e-mail address, address, credit card numbers, bank account number and telephone number) on your order form only for the purpose of selling the products ordered by you; </li>
<li>when you request technical assistance, we collect your personal data in order to provide you with information on net-surfing, Internet browsing or viewing and downloading web pages; </li>
<li>when creating your Wish List, we process your personal data in order to customize our services for the purchase of products on the US Site. </li></ul>
<p>Your personal data is generally processed by electronic means; however, in certain circumstances, paper-based means may be used (for example, when the processing of your personal data is required for the prevention of fraud against us). <br>Your personal data is stored in a way which allows YOOX USA to identify you for the period that is strictly necessary for the original purposes for which such personal data is collected and subsequently processed, all in accordance with applicable laws. <br>Please report any changes to your personal data to <a href="mailto:privacy@thecorner.com">privacy@thecorner.com</a> in order to ensure that your personal data is always accurate and kept up-to-date. <br>Your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties for purposes not permitted by law or without your explicit consent. <br>Your personal data may only be disclosed to third parties when it is necessary to process an order placed by you. For example, your personal data is disclosed to Paymentech Inc. for the performance of electronic payment services, through credit/debit cards. Moreover, your personal data may be disclosed to the police or to judicial authorities, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and upon a formal request by such authorities for the purposes of preventing a fraud against us (anti-fraud services). Data processors will also have access to your personal data, as stated in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy, for the specific purposes stated in that Section. In all the above circumstances, your consent for data processing will not be specifically requested.<br>YOOX USA does not disclose your personal data to the public, unless it receives your approval and only in connection with the supply of services through the US Site (for example, in order to allow YOOX USA, upon your request, to post your suggestions on the US Site as a testimonial.) <br>Your personal data will not be transferred to any countries outside the United States and Italy if such countries do not provide for an adequate level of protection of the privacy of individuals. Should the above be necessary in order to supply services to you or to execute contracts for the purchase of products between you and YOOX USA, the transfer of your personal data to any such countries will be carried out only after the execution of specific contracts between YOOX USA and all parties involved, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. <br>If YOOX USA receives your consent, it may process your personal data in order to send you information on new commercial initiatives which are strictly related to the US Site's activities and services, or for direct marketing purposes, including by e-mail. <br>YOOX USA may have access to third parties' personal data which is directly disclosed by its users to YOOX USA, for instance when the user buys a product to be sent to a friend, when the user who pays the purchase price for a product is different from the recipient of such product, or when a user wishes to recommend to a friend a service provided through the US Site or the sale of a particular product posted on the US Site. <br>In all cases involving the disclosure of information of a third party, you must obtain the consent of such individuals before disclosing their personal data to YOOX USA and have informed said individuals about this Privacy Policy. You will be the only person liable in connection with the disclosure of information and data relevant to such third parties and with any other incompatible and unlawful use of such data if they have not provided you with their consent. <br>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold YOOX and YOOX USA harmless from any liability, loss, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees, arising from or related to any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information of third parties. <br><br></p></td></tr>
