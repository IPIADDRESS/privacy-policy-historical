However, your personal data may also be used for other processing operations within the limits of such purposes. <br>In particular, your personal data may be processed for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>when you register with the US Site we collect your personal data (for example, your personal information, password, e-mail address, gender, favorite designer) through the relevant registration form (My Corner) in order to provide you with services in reserved access areas of the US Site and in order to send you our Newsletter, when specifically requested; </li>
<li>when you request Customer Care services, we collect your personal data (for example, your password) for purposes strictly necessary to provide you with customer care services relevant to the US Site and to the purchase of products on the US Site; </li>
<li>when you are executing purchasing procedures for products sold on the US Site, including conclusion of an agreement for the purchase of products, we collect your personal data (for example, personal information, e-mail address, address, credit card numbers, bank account number and telephone number) on your order form only for the purpose of selling the products ordered by you; </li>

<li>when creating your Wish List, we process your personal data in order to customize our services for the purchase of products on the US Site. </li></ul>Your personal data is generally processed by electronic means; however, in certain circumstances, paper-based means may be used (for example, when the processing of your personal data is required for the prevention of fraud against us). <br>Your personal data is stored in a way which allows YOOX USA to identify you for the period that is strictly necessary for the original purposes for which such personal data is collected and subsequently processed, all in accordance with applicable laws. <br>Please report any changes to your personal data to <a href="mailto:privacy@thecorner.com">privacy@thecorner.com</a> in order to ensure that your personal data is always accurate and kept up-to-date. <br>Your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties for purposes not permitted by law or without your explicit consent. <br>Your personal data may only be disclosed to third parties when it is necessary to process an order placed by you. For example, your personal data is disclosed to Paymentech Inc. for the performance of electronic payment services, through credit/debit cards. Moreover, your personal data may be disclosed to the police or to judicial authorities, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and upon a formal request by such authorities for the purposes of preventing a fraud against us (anti-fraud services). Data processors will also have access to your personal data, as stated in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy, for the specific purposes stated in that Section. In all the above circumstances, your consent for data processing will not be specifically requested.<br>YOOX USA does not disclose your personal data to the public, unless it receives your approval and only in connection with the supply of services through the US Site (for example, in order to allow YOOX USA, upon your request, to post your suggestions on the US Site as a testimonial.) <br>Your personal data will not be transferred to any countries outside the United States and Italy if such countries do not provide for an adequate level of protection of the privacy of individuals. Should the above be necessary in order to supply services to you or to execute contracts for the purchase of products between you and YOOX USA, the transfer of your personal data to any such countries will be carried out only after the execution of specific contracts between YOOX USA and all parties involved, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. <br>If YOOX USA receives your consent, it may process your personal data in order to send you information on new commercial initiatives which are strictly related to the US Site's activities and services, or for direct marketing purposes, including by e-mail. <br>YOOX USA may have access to third parties' personal data which is directly disclosed by its users to YOOX USA, for instance when the user buys a product to be sent to a friend, when the user who pays the purchase price for a product is different from the recipient of such product, or when a user wishes to recommend to a friend a service provided through the US Site or the sale of a particular product posted on the US Site. <br>In all cases involving the disclosure of information of a third party, you must obtain the consent of such individuals before disclosing their personal data to YOOX USA and have informed said individuals about this Privacy Policy. You will be the only person liable in connection with the disclosure of information and data relevant to such third parties and with any other incompatible and unlawful use of such data if they have not provided you with their consent. <br>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold YOOX and YOOX USA harmless from any liability, loss, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or related to any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information of third parties. <br><br><span>4. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO YOOX USA</span> <br>The personal data we request you provide to YOOX USA, including your e-mail address, your address, your credit/debit card numbers, bank account number and your telephone number, is necessary for the processing of your order for the purchase of products on the US Site, to supply other services provided on the US Site upon your request, or to carry out obligations arising out of applicable laws and regulations.<br>Your refusal to provide certain personal data to YOOX USA may prevent YOOX USA from processing your order for the purchase of products sold on the US Site or from providing other services through the US Site, such as Customer Care services, sending the Newsletter, use of the Wish List, sending a flower to a friend, or recommending a product to a friend.<br>Your failure to provide personal data to YOOX USA may justify YOOX USA's refusal to process your order for the purchase of products sold or to provide services through the US Site.<br>The disclosure of personal data to YOOX USA other than that required in order to fulfill legal or contractual obligations or to provide the services requested by you is optional and does not have any effect on the use of the US Site and its services or on the purchase of products on the US Site (for example, the name of your favorite designer).<br>We will inform you if the personal data we ask you to provide is necessary or optional by marking with an asterisk (*) the information that is necessary. Your Failure to disclose optional personal data will not pose any obligation or disadvantage to you, except to the extent that we may no be able to offer you some of our optional, personalized features of the US Site.<br><br><span>5. TO WHOM YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL BE DISCLOSED </span><br>Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties who provide specific services as Data Processors on behalf of YOOX USA or who autonomously process personal data collected by YOOX USA in connection with the performance of a contract for the purchase of products on the US Site (for example, Paymentech Inc.). Any such disclosure will be conducted, in each instance, without exceeding the original purposes for which your personal data was collected and subsequently processed.<br>In addition, your personal data may be disclosed to third parties in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental and judiciary inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, and (4) protect the rights or property of YOOX USA and YOOX Italy. <br>Any third party information disclosed to YOOX USA in accordance with this Privacy Policy will not be used for any purpose other than as required to technically operate the service, to complete a transaction, or as otherwise required by law.<br>In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of YOOX USA including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, or transfer of substantial assets, YOOX USA may, in its sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign personal data collected on and through the US Site, including, without limitation, personally identifiable information and aggregate information concerning users and customers, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.<br><br><span>6.
