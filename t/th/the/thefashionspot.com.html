Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</td></tr><tr><td>Functionality Cookies</td><td>Functionality cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, for example remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have voted in (and in some cases to show you poll results) and remembering changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services.</td></tr><tr><td>Social Media Cookies</td><td>Social media cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this.</td></tr><tr><td>Targeted and advertising cookies</td><td>Targeted and advertising cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show advertisements that may be relevant to your interests while you are on third-party websites. These cookies also store your location, including your latitude, longitude, and GeoIP region ID, which helps us show you locale-specific news and allows our Services to operate more efficiently. You can disable cookies that remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting<a href="https://youradchoices.com/control" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://youradchoices.com']);"> https://youradchoices.com/control</a>. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><b>Flash</b></p><p>A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that is built into or downloaded by you onto your device.
