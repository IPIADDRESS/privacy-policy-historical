<span class="italic">At  M Resort, we are aware of your  concerns about privacy. We have implemented policies and procedures to  ensure that your personal information is handled safely and with the utmost  responsibility. The following Privacy Policy outlines the type of  information M Resort will collect and how it will be used. These  procedures apply to only M Resort. In the event additional properties are  included, this Privacy Policy will  be updated to include those web sites.</span><br><br>


<span class="bold">Collection  of Information</span><br>
As  appropriate, M Resort may collect  personally identifiable information from you voluntarily to provide you with a  particular service. We may ask you for your information such as name, address,  telephone number and e-mail address.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Cookies</span><br>
A cookie is  a small file stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable  information while on our site. Cookies also measure usage of various pages on  our website to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and  easy for you to access, and they  provide functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.<br><br>

You may set  your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular  browser on how to do this), although  doing so will adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain  content on our website.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Browsing</span><br>
We do not  collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse  this website and request pages from our servers. Unless you voluntarily and  knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name,  your e-mail address, or any other  personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our web site, our servers log the information provided in the  HTTP request header including the IP number,  the time of the request, the URL of  your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Security  and Storage</span><br>
The M Resort  Web Site and all personal and general information that reaches M Resort is  stored on secure servers generally located in the United States. Because laws  applicable to personal information vary by country,  our hotel and other business operations may put in place additional measures  that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Conversely, the United States may not require a  level of privacy protection as great as that offered in other  jurisdictions. M Resort makes no representation that this privacy policy  complies with requirements outside the United States. While M  Resort will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain the security  of personal information that you may furnish to us,  such disclosure is at your own risk.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Sharing  of Information</span><br>
M Resort may  share your personal information with our properties,  affiliates and select third parties as we deem appropriate. Your personal  information may also be disclosed if necessary to: (1) enforce our Web Site  Agreement; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of M Resort; (3)  comply with a court order or other legal process or other legal requirements of  any governmental authorities,  including but not limited to authorities that regulate gaming activities; or  (4) governmental authorities, in the  sole discretion of M Resort, in  exceptional circumstances, such as a  national emergency, security concern, or other situation in which M Resort deems such  disclosure prudent.<br><br>

M Resort  uses the services of third parties,  such as e-mail service providers and marketing companies that act on behalf of  M Resort. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally  identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose M Resort  specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain  service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of  performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or  transfer of personal information to entities outside of the M Resort family of  companies for use without your approval.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Special  Offer/Promotions E-Mails &amp; Opt Out</span><br>
It is our  intention to send you only e-mail communications that will be useful to you and  that you want to receive. These communications will relate to M Resort offers  and/or the promotions of select,  reputable third parties with whom M Resort has a strategic marketing  relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be  of interest to you. We use a third party e-mail service provider to send  e-mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for  any purpose other than to send M Resort related e-mail. When you receive an e-mail, you will be provided the choice to opt-out of  future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.<br><br>

<span class="bold">The  Children's Online Privacy Act</span><br>
M Resort  does not knowingly or intentionally collect any personally identifiable  information from, or market to or  target, individuals under the age of  21. Pursuant to law, persons under  the age of 21 are not permitted to gamble at our properties or loiter in casino  areas. Similarly, our website is not  intended for persons under the age of 21.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Use  of Third party Internet Sites</span><br>
Third party  Internet sites and services accessible through M Resort have separate privacy  and data collection practices,  independent from us. M Resort has no responsibility or liability for  these independent policies or actions.<br><br>

<span class="bold">Privacy  Statement Changes</span><br>
In  the future, we may need to change  this privacy statement. All changes will posted here so that you will always  know what information we gather, how  we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</div>
