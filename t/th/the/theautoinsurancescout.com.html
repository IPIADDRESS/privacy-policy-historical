State of California or Vermont and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of
your personal information to any third-party for marketing purposes, please  <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@customerpermissionservices.com">Click Here</a>. 
Please be advised that where California or Vermont residents opt-out from

<br><br>When you register on our Site, you hereby
agree and acknowledge that your personal information will be placed into the Monetizeit™
database and that such personal information shall be shared with third parties
for marketing purposes.  
<br>
<br> 
<b>Your
IP Address</b>
<br> 
<br>Each time that you
visit the Site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address and the
web page from which you came.  Your IP address is used to help identify you and
to gather broad demographic information about you.  We also use your IP address
to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Site and to
better serve you in using the products, services and other features contained
within the Site. 
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Cookies
and Action Tags</b>
<br> 
<br><u>Cookies</u>:  The first time
that a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at
the Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy
a cookie to the applicable user's PC.  Whenever that user comes back to the
Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to
recall the user's e-mail address.  If, at any time, a user provides other
information in connection with their activities on the Site (such as name,
address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with
the user’s e-mail address, in our user database. We may use the information
stored in our database: (a) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which
the information was originally provided by a user; (b) to pre-populate
information fields in the event that user wishes to purchase products and/or
services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other
offers in the future; (c) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed
to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Site;
and/or (d) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include
offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to
be, of interest to that user.  We also use cookies to anonymously track and
target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience on the
Site.  To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.  To
disable and reject cookies, adjust the settings via the toolbar options menu of
your internet browser.    
<br> 
<br><u>Action Tags, Web
Beacons and other Data Collection Methods</u>:  An action tag or a web-beacon (also
known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or
actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on the
Site.  Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are
used to transparently collect information.  We may use action tags to count the
number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the
pages of the Site and to provide information about what products/services are
viewed or purchased.  We reserve the right to retain this cookie and action tag
data indefinitely.  At no time will we share cookie-related, action-tag-related
and/or generated information and/or data with third parties.
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Personal
Information We Collect from You</b>
<br> 
<br>We collect your personally identifiable
information when you sign up to receive Insurance Services at the Site.  <strong>We may also collect your personally
identifiable information when you otherwise agree to the terms of this Privacy
Policy, but do not complete the applicable registration process in full</strong><b>.</b>
 The types of personally identifiable information that we collect at the Site
and/or when you sign up to receive Insurance Services include, without
limitation: (a) your e-mail address; (b) state of residence; and/or (c) any
other information requested on the applicable application.    
<br> 
<br> 
<b>How
We Use Personal Information</b>
<br> 
<br>By submitting your personal information on
the Site, you agree that we may share such personal information with our Third
Party Service Providers in order to complete your request for Insurance
Services.  Our Third Party Service Providers may use such personal information
for any lawful purposes, subject to any restrictions contained herein
including, without limitation, in connection with contacting you for purposes
of completing your application for the Insurance Services.  Any information
that you subsequently supply to any Third Party Service Providers shall be
governed by such Third Party Service Providers’ privacy policies.  <b>Please be advised that </b><b>Monetizeit™ does not itself auto insurance-related products
and/or services.  The Insurance Services will
be provided by Third Party Service Providers, and the
ultimate terms and conditions of the Insurance Services will be determined by those Third Party Service
Providers.  </b>  
<br> 
<br>We may share the personal information that
you supply to us with any third party and we may work with other businesses to
bring selected retail opportunities to our users.  These businesses and third
parties may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing
services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; (c) telemarketers; (d) SMS
text-based marketers (where permitted by applicable law); and (e) direct
marketers.
<br> 
<br>We may also employ
other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.
Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate
information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. 
The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access
to our users’ personal information as needed to perform their functions for us
but we do not permit them to use your personal information for other purposes.
<br> 
<br>Additionally, we
purchase and manage e-mail lists generated by third parties. Users may remove
themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options
that are present and available at the end of each piece of e-mail that we send.
<br> 
<br>We will also use your
personal information for customer service, to provide you with information that
you may request, to customize your experience on the Site and/or to contact you
when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Site.
 We may also use your personal information for internal business purposes, such
as analyzing and managing our business.  We may also combine the information we
have gathered about you with information from other sources.  We may use third
parties to help us operate our business and the Site or to administer
activities on our behalf.  
<br> 
<br>We also reserve the
right to release current or past user information in the event that we believe
that the user is using, or has used, our products, services and/or Site: (i) in
violation of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy or any other of
our operating rules, policies, price schedules and other supplemental terms and
conditions or documents that may be published by us from time to time; (ii) to
commit unlawful acts; (iii) if such information is subpoenaed; (iv) if we are
sold or acquired; and/or (v) when we deem it necessary or appropriate
including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third
parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003,
as amended from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission implementing
regulations.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the
right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all personal information with/to any
third party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and
applicable law.  
<br>   
<br>By registering at the
Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for
purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as
amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call
regulations.  As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed
on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state
do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in
accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations.
<br> 
<br>In
addition, you agree that by submitting your personal information at
the Site, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to,
text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and
marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by
applicable law).  As such, notwithstanding that
your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call
registries, we retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing
in accordance with applicable state and federal law.  Further, you agree that
we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute
your mobile telephone and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and
all non-marketing uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law. 

<br> 
<br>You may unsubscribe
from any of our e-mail marketing programs at any time.  In every e-mail
communication that we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the
recipient to unsubscribe from the specific marketing program by simply clicking
the hyperlink provided and following the instructions that follow.  We attempt
to process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after
unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another mailing
from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a
different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into.  We can guarantee,
however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail communication from us,
you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink.  We
are able to offer our free services, in part, based upon the willingness of our
users to be contacted by our marketing partners, including affiliated third
party advertisers. By allowing us to make the information that you supply
available to our marketing partners, you will receive free product and service
information that may be of interest to you.  You may, at any time, notify us
that you do not wish to have your personal information disclosed to third
parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@customerpermissionservices.com">unsubscribe@customerpermissionservices.com.</a>
<br> 
<br><b>How We Use Demographic Information and
Aggregate Data</b>
<br> 
<br>We use demographic
information to tailor the Site to the interests of our users. Demographic
information is shared with third party advertisers so that they can tailor
their advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic information may
also be shared with other third parties.  
<br> 
<br>We reserve the right to provide aggregate or
group data about our users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data
that describes the demographics, usage or characteristics of our participants
as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By opening
an account with us, you agree to allow us to provide such aggregate data to
third parties. By agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you hereby
consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party
when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate. 
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Other
Websites</b>
<br> 
<br>This Site may contain
links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites including, but not
limited to, the websites of our Third Party Service Providers.  Monetizeit™ is
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.  In
some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of their third-party
websites.  In these instances, you may be required to provide certain
information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction
at such website.  These third-party websites have separate privacy and data
collection practices and Monetizeit™ has no responsibility or liability
relating to them.
</p><p><b>Third-Party
Offers</b>
<br>Monetizeit™ provides
its users with the opportunity to receive special offers, products and/or
services from third parties including, but not limited to, our Third Party
Service Providers.  Where you indicate the desire to receive certain offers,
products or services from a third party during the applicable information
collection process, your personally identifiable information that was provided
during that Monetizeit™ information collection process will be shared with the
applicable third party so that such third party may provide their product or
service to you and so that you do not have to complete another information
collection form (or re-supply the same information) to purchase or receive that
product or service.  
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Our
Security Precautions</b>
<br> 
<br>We endeavor to
safeguard and protect our users’ information.  When users submit information at
the Site, their information is protected both online and off-line.  The privacy
of your personal information is very important to us.  The servers that we
store personally identifiable information in are kept in a secure physical
environment.  We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
and alteration of personal information under our control.  Please be advised
that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to
protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be
absolutely secure.  Any transmission of data at or through our Site is at your
own risk.  However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not
accessible to the public.  All of our users’ information is
restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform
a specific job are granted access to personal information.  Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security
and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering to our firm
policies are subject to disciplinary action.  In compliance with applicable
federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory
agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with
respect to your Personal Information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the
event of such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order
to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage,
and to engage in remedial measures.
<br> 
<br><b>Minors</b>
<br> 
<br>No information should be submitted to, or
posted at, the Site by visitors under eighteen (18) years of age.  Persons
eighteen (18) years of age and younger are not permitted to access the Site and
we do not knowingly collect personal information from such individuals.  We
encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to
participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Removal
of Your Information/Opting Out</b>
<br> 
<br>At your request, we
will remove personal information that you have provided to us.  You may do so
by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@customerpermissionservices.com">unsubscribe@customerpermissionservices.com</a>.
 However, deleting your Personal Information, or otherwise opting-out of
receipt of communications from us or third parties, will only change or delete
the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business on the
Site and for managing future communications from us and third parties.  These
deletions will not change or delete personal information already collected as
part of a particular transaction in our database, which may have already been
shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy.  You
will need to contact third parties who may contact you directly to change your
preferences or your personal information that they may be using to contact you.
<br> 
<br>We provide users with
the option to opt-out from receiving information sent via electronic mailings
on behalf of third party advertisers.  Users may unsubscribe from receiving
e-mails at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every
e-mailing.  Unsubscribe requests can only be processed if you have registered
with us in the first instance.  If you have not registered with us and wish to
opt out of receiving e-mails from a particular sender, please consult that
sender’s opt out policies or contact that sender.
<br> 
<br>Information sent on
behalf of third party advertisers is prepared several days in advance, so users
may continue to receive e-mail from us for up to ten (10) days following the
unsubscribe procedures detailed above. If, after that point, a user is still
receiving e-mail from us, the user should contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@customerpermissionservices.com">legal@customerpermissionservices.com</a>.
<br> 
<br> 
<b>No
Liability for Unauthorized Changes</b>
<br> 
<br>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED
MODIFICATION OF TEXT OR ADVERTISEMENTS PROVIDED BY US, OUR MARKETING PARTNERS
OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTIES.
<br>

portions of this Privacy Policy at any time.  All Privacy Policy changes will
