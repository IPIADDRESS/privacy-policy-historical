<p>Preview provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information received from users of this website, located at thepreviewapp.com (“Site”), as well as all related websites, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Preview Terms of Use.</p>
<p>By using our Service you are consenting to our Processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. “Processing” means using cookies on a computer or using or accessing such information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities may take place in Australia.</p>
<p>The Service is hosted in Australia. If you choose to use the Service from the U.S., European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from Australian law, then please note that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to Australia and Processed under Australian privacy standards. Also, we may transfer your data from Australia to other countries or regions in connection with the Processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. By visiting our Service and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and Processing in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong></p>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information from you are to provide you with the products and services made available through the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one. We may also use your information to operate, maintain, and enhance the Service and its features, and to provide customer support to users.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED UPON REGISTRATION</strong></p>
<p>You provide us with information when you register for an account, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Preview. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, credit card and other billing information, preferences, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with. We may link such information with other information you provide about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS USER DATA</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to connect a social media account or profile to your Preview account, we will access certain information obtained from the social media regarding your account. In particular we may store your name and email address as well as information on the particular page or profile you connect, including post content and engagement data. This data will only be used by Preview to provide you with the service you expect and will not be shared with any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF CONTACT INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please un-follow us, or follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. You may also opt out from receiving commercial email from us by sending your request to us by email at hi@athepreviewapp.com. Please be aware that if you opt out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may continue receiving promotional communications from us during that period. Additionally, even after you opt out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding the Service.</p>
<p><strong>LOG DATA</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>CONSENT</strong></p>
<p>By using the Service, or submitting or collecting any personally identifiable information via the Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage disclosure, and use of your personally identifiable information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the use of your personally identifiable information in these ways, please stop using the Service.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES AND AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Preview uses “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Preview may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. Preview does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.</p>
<p>We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTY WEB BEACONS AND THIRD PARTY BUTTONS</strong></p>
<p>We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the Facebook “share” button) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Preview. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>Our primary purpose for using your information is to publish your content on social platforms. In addition, we may share and disclose your information for the following reasons:</p>
<p>• Service Providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, billing, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p>
<p>• Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Preview cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate, respond to, and defend against claims, for legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Preview or a third party, to protect Preview against liability, for the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, fraudulent, abusive, or legally actionable activity, to protect the security or integrity of the Service and any equipment used to make the Service available, or to comply with the law.</p>
