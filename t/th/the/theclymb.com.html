        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>The Clymb respects the privacy needs of our valued
        customers and members. This Privacy Policy outlines what
        specific information is gathered on TheClymb.com site and
        how that information is used. The Clymb works to ensure
        highest degree of protection for consumers and businesses.
        In fact, our standards meet (and exceed) the U.S.
        Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbors" standards. We will
        continue to work to ensure that our website complies with
        strict standards for online privacy, security, business
        practices, transaction integrity and availability. If you
        have any specific questions about the The
        Clymb's Privacy Statement, please
        contact us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@TheClymb.com">privacy@TheClymb.com</a>. </p>

        <h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THECLYMB.COM</h3>
        <p>The Clymb explicitly asks when we need information that
        personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your
        personal information is used to create your personal access
        to products on the site, and to contact you in the course
        of using the products. Financial information that is
        collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either
        you or your company for products. Demographic and profile
        data collected by The Clymb may be used to tailor the
        website or any requested email communications, and to
        display information that is more relevant to you. The Clymb
        also compiles demographic and product use information, but
        in the aggregate only. Under no circumstances will The
        Clymb make any personal information about an individual
        user available to anyone. Your email address is used to
        only send you information that you have requested. As part
        of your use of any The Clymb product, The Clymb allows you
        to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information
        from The Clymb. The Clymb adheres strictly to
        permission-based email policy. The Clymb will not send you
        unsolicited email information, commercial offers or
        advertisements. The Clymb will not sell, rent, or loan our
        contact lists or our customer's contact lists (including
        customer data) to any outside firms. All emails that you
        have requested will have an option to unsubscribe.
        Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled immediately and no
        further communications will be sent to users who have
        stated that they do not wish to receive the specified
        information. While IP addresses (address of a computer) are
        logged to track a user's session, the user's identity is
        anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives The Clymb
        information about which parts of our site are used most
        often and what information is viewed. </p>

        <h3>INFORMATION USE BY THIRD PARTIES</h3>
        <p>It is The Clymb policy to never provide your personal
        information to third parties without your express
        permission or only in instances where such disclosure is
        necessary to process payment transactions or provide
        services that you have requested. We do not release
        personal information about you as an individual. The only
        exception is if The Clymb is compelled to do so by an
        appropriately empowered governmental authority. The Clymb
        will not share with them any more information than is
        necessary to perform the transaction you have requested.
        The Clymb will not sell, rent, loan or allow external
        access to a customer's contact lists. </p>

        <h3>CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>The Clymb allows you to purchase merchandise in a variety
        of ways. When credit card billing is chosen, information is
        transferred to The Clymb's Clearing House Partner using
        industry-leading, secure transmission technology including
        SSL and HTTPS (the transmission standard used for
        transactions by major financial institutions). The
        information is then encrypted using Data Encryption and
        stored securely so that it is ready to handle your
        transactions. </p>

        <h3>THE BOTTOM LINE</h3>
        <p>Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount
        importance to us as it helps foster confidence, goodwill
        and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at
        any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy
        practices, please feel free contact us at :
