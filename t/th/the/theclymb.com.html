<div id="indent">

	        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
	        <p>The Clymb respects the privacy needs of our valued
	        customers and members. This Privacy Policy outlines what
	        specific information is gathered on TheClymb.com site and
	        how that information is used. The Clymb works to ensure
	        highest degree of protection for consumers and businesses.
	        In fact, our standards meet (and exceed) the U.S.
	        Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbors" standards. We will
	        continue to work to ensure that our website complies with
	        strict standards for online privacy, security, business
	        practices, transaction integrity and availability. If you
	        have any specific questions about the The
	        Clymb's Privacy Statement, please
	        contact us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@TheClymb.com">privacy@TheClymb.com</a>. </p>

	        <h3>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THECLYMB.COM</h3>
	        <p>The Clymb explicitly asks when we need information that
	        personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your
	        personal information is used to create your personal access
	        to products on the site, and to contact you in the course
	        of using the products. Financial information that is
	        collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either
	        you or your company for products. Demographic and profile
	        data collected by The Clymb may be used to tailor the
	        website or any requested email communications, and to
	        display information that is more relevant to you. The Clymb
	        also compiles demographic and product use information, but
	        in the aggregate only. Under no circumstances will The
	        Clymb make any personal information about an individual
	        user available to anyone. Your email address is used to
	        only send you information that you have requested. As part
	        of your use of any The Clymb product, The Clymb allows you
	        to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information
	        from The Clymb. The Clymb adheres strictly to
	        permission-based email policy. The Clymb will not send you
	        unsolicited email information, commercial offers or
	        advertisements. The Clymb will not sell, rent, or loan our
	        contact lists or our customer's contact lists (including
	        customer data) to any outside firms. All emails that you
	        have requested will have an option to unsubscribe.
	        Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled immediately and no
	        further communications will be sent to users who have
	        stated that they do not wish to receive the specified
	        information. While IP addresses (address of a computer) are
	        logged to track a user's session, the user's identity is
	        anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives The Clymb
	        information about which parts of our site are used most
	        often and what information is viewed. </p>

	        <h3>INFORMATION USE BY THIRD PARTIES</h3>
	        <p>It is The Clymb policy to never provide your personal
	        information to third parties without your express
	        permission or only in instances where such disclosure is
	        necessary to process payment transactions or provide
	        services that you have requested. We do not release
	        personal information about you as an individual. The only
	        exception is if The Clymb is compelled to do so by an
	        appropriately empowered governmental authority. The Clymb
	        will not share with them any more information than is
	        necessary to perform the transaction you have requested.
	        The Clymb will not sell, rent, loan or allow external
	        access to a customer's contact lists. </p>

	        <h3>CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</h3>
	        <p>The Clymb allows you to purchase merchandise in a variety
	        of ways. When credit card billing is chosen, information is
	        transferred to The Clymb's Clearing House Partner using
	        industry-leading, secure transmission technology including
	        SSL and HTTPS (the transmission standard used for
	        transactions by major financial institutions). The
	        information is then encrypted using Data Encryption and
	        stored securely so that it is ready to handle your
	        transactions. </p>

	        <h3>THE BOTTOM LINE</h3>

	        <p>Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount
	        importance to us as it helps foster confidence, goodwill
	        and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at
	        any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy
	        practices, please feel free contact us at :
	        <a href="mailto:privacy@theclymb.com">privacy@theclymb.com</a>
