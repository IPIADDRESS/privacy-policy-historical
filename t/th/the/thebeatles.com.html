</ol><p align="LEFT"><strong>How and when can you withdraw your consent?</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">Much of what we do with your personal information is based on other legal grounds. For processing that is based on your consent, you have the right to take back that consent for future processing at any time. You can do this by contacting us (see below). The consequence is that we cannot send you our newsletter or other marketing communications.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Will your personal information be transferred outside the UK or the European Economic Area?</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">We have explained that we may disclose your personal information to other members of the Apple group of companies and agents or contractors acting for us or them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="LEFT">Personal Information may in addition be transferred to other locations outside the EEA for example to our service providers if they or their servers are based there. When your personal information is processed inside the UK and the EEA then it is protected by data protection laws. Some other countries and territories do have adequate protection for personal information by law. We will make sure that suitable safeguards are in place before we transfer your personal information to those countries except in cases where what are called ‘derogations’ apply.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For more information about suitable safeguards and (as relevant) how to obtain a copy of them or to find out where they have been made available you can contact our Data Manager – our contact details are in this privacy notice.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Safeguards can include: (i) the Standard Data Protection Clauses (also known as EU Model Clauses) obtain a copy of them or to find out where they have been made available you can contact our Data Manager using the details below; (ii) the US Privacy Shield and details are available here: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome</a> or you can contact our Data Manager using the details below for more information; or (iii) Binding Corporate Rules provided the recipients in other countries have obtained the requisite approvals and the published list of approvals.

<p align="LEFT"><strong>What if you are using this website from outside the UK?</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">We operate this website from within the UK. &nbsp;We are not subject to your country’s local laws and this privacy notice may not be compliant with those laws (for example, laws related to direct marketing and the use of cookies on websites).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Direct marketing (using your personal information)</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you consent by opting in, we may use your information in order to send you our newsletter and other direct marketing by email about products and services of Apple Corps relating to the Beatles, about all four members of the Beatles taken separately, and about other members of the Apple group of companies and of carefully selected third parties such as Cirque Du Soleil companies, Universal Music companies, MPL (McCartney Productions Limited) and Harrisongs Limited. &nbsp;This means that we will make it clear on the relevant pages of our website if the personal information we collect (ie name and contact information including email address) may be used for direct marketing purposes and we will ask for your consent on those pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, as follows:</p>
<p align="LEFT">In each direct marketing communication we send by electronic means (including our email newsletter) we will remind you of how you can prevent further electronic direct marketing. &nbsp;You may do this by using the link provided in the marketing email to send an “UNSUBSCRIBE” request.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong>Information about other people</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">On the “my comments” and “my wall” pages on the profile pages of registered users and in the “free text” boxes on our website it is possible to input information about other people. &nbsp;On the profile pages of registered users there is a facility to link up with “My friends”, ie other registered users. &nbsp;You must not disclose any personal information about “My friends” or any other people on this website (including but not limited to on the “my Comments” or “my Wall” pages or in “free text” boxes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Security&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">It is important to bear in mind that the internet is not a secure means of communication. &nbsp;We cannot guarantee the security of personal information sent to us through this website.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you sign up as a registered user of this website, you will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. &nbsp;You should not disclose it to any other person. &nbsp;Please notify our Data Manager promptly (contact details above) if you believe your username or password may have been compromised. &nbsp;We will not be responsible to you if there is unauthorised access to your user account as a result of someone else using your login details after you have compromised them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">We may also monitor users’ behaviour on their beatles.com profile pages. Our monitoring may check for obscene or profane content, threatening or anti-social behaviour, or anything that might compromise the safety, enjoyment or privacy of our users.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Profiling and other automated decision making</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">This section is relevant where we make decisions about you using only technology, and where none of our employees or any other individuals have been involved in the process. For instance, we may do this to decide what marketing communications are suitable for you based on your age, location or music preferences.</p>
<p align="LEFT">We can do this activity based on our legitimate interests (and they are listed in the section about legal grounds above) and this is because this activity does not have a legal or other significant effect on you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Profiling for direct marketing can mean there is a right to object (see ‘rights to object’ below).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Retention of your personal information</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the event that your beatles.com account is terminated by you or by us, we will retain your personal information after that termination only for as long as is reasonably necessary bearing in mind the purpose(s) for which it was collected (see above) or for as long as is necessary in case of any legal challenges or other problems, or as is otherwise permitted or required by law. &nbsp;After that period your personal information will be suppressed in or deleted from our database(s).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unless we explain otherwise to you, we will generally hold your personal information in accordance with the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li class="pp">
<p align="LEFT"><strong>Retention in case of queries. </strong>We will retain the personal information that we need to keep in case of queries from you;</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul><p align="LEFT">If you would like further information about our data retention practices, contact our Data Manager.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><strong>What are your rights under data protection laws?</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here is a list of the rights that all individuals have under data protection laws. They do not apply in all circumstances. If you wish to exercise any of them we will explain at that time if they are engaged or not. The right of data portability is only relevant from May 2018.

<p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Data anonymization and aggregating your personal information</strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong>Minors</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">We do not wish to allow children to use all parts of our website. &nbsp;This is to protect their personal information. &nbsp;Children may of course view our website but parents/guardians should remind them how to handle their personal information securely and responsibly on the internet. &nbsp;They should also familiarize themselves with our website to ensure they are happy for their children to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong>Linking&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">We may link to other websites which are not within our control. Once you have left our website, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide and we have no control over how your personal information is used by third parties operating other websites. In addition, other websites outside our control may link to our website. &nbsp;You should exercise caution and look at the terms and conditions and the privacy statement applicable to the other website in question. &nbsp;No link is intended to be, nor should be construed as, an endorsement of any kind by us of another website.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, the “STORE” tab on our website links to the Beatles online store at thebeatlesonline.co.uk and this is operated by Universal Music. &nbsp;We also link to the iTunes store e.g. where you can purchase Beatles social media application(s) and this is operated by Apple, Inc. &nbsp;In addition, you may choose to link up your beatles.com profile to your profiles on third party websites including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. &nbsp;You should read the terms and conditions and privacy statements on all such third party websites before you use them including before you link your beatles.com profile to them (as applicable).</p>
