<h4>Google Analytics Privacy Notice</h4>



<p>Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our products and services to users, improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. We have enabled Google Analytics advertising features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with PD.

Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website.

<h4>Google Remarketing</h4>



<p>Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?</p>



<p>Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website.</p>



<p>The website’s owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes. For this to happen, Google will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies and remarketing at this link: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a> or you can opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at: <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</a></p>



<p><strong><em>Facebook Remarketing</em></strong></p>



<p>Third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. With Facebook remarketing you may see our ads on Facebook after you have visited our site. For this to happen, Facebook uses a Custom Audience Pixel that is activated when a visitor lands on a webpage and a unique “cookie” is placed in their browser. Facebook lookalike audience targeting allows us to show ads on Facebook to people who are similar to those who have already visited or made a purchase from our website. To opt out of Facebook’s collection and use of information for ad targeting visit: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217</a></p>
