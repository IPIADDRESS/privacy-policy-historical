<h4>Google Analytics Privacy Policy</h4>

<h4>Web Beacons</h4>
<p>We may also use a technology called “web beacons” (also known as a pixel tag or clear gif) that is delivered through a web browser and certain email client applications to an end user’s computer. The web beacon runs a tag that records a user’s visit to a particular web page.</p>
<p>Web beacons are often used with a web cookie and provided as part of a third-party tracking service. Web beacons along with web server logs allow us to create specific user profiles about their behavior. The information we collect by web beacons also allows us to statistically record the number of people that open our emails.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reporting which emails are read by recipients</li>
<li>Recording file downloads</li>
<li>Ad campaign management</li>
</ul>
<h4>Automatic Information</h4>
<p>We automatically receive information from your web browser or mobile device.
