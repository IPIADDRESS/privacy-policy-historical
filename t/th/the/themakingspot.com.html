<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Types of information we may collect about you</b></span></h3>
<p>When you sign up to our services, such as our website forums, mobile applications, regular newsletters, enter competitions, buy a magazine subscription, order products or take up a reader offer we may ask for personal information about you. This can include information such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth. Different services may ask for different types of information.</p>
<p>If you are aged 16 or under, you must get your parent/guardian’s permission before you provide us with your personal information. Unless you have this consent you are not allowed to give us your information.<br>
Here is some more specific detail about the information we may collect:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Information you give to us:&nbsp;</strong>information that you provide by filling in forms on our services. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use an app or website, subscribing to any services, posting material, filling in a survey or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion and when you report a problem with our services.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Information about your use of our websites:</b>&nbsp;we may collect your IP address and use cookies on our websites.&nbsp;For full information about our use of cookies please see our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.immediate.co.uk/cookies-policy/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Cookies Policy</b></span></a>.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Information about the device you are using</b>:&nbsp;if you download one of our apps we may collect information about the device you use to access the app, including, where available, the device’s unique identifiers, operating system, browser type and mobile network information as well as the device’s telephone number, for system administration and to report statistical information to our advertisers.&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</li>

<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Information about your location</b>:&nbsp;when you use one of our location-enabled services, we may collect information about your actual location but we will always ask you about this first. You can change your mind at any time by updating your preferences on your device.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Information about transactions</b>: if you purchase something from us such as a magazine subscription or an app, we will make a record of the details of that transaction.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Contact information</b>: if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><b>How we look after your information</b></span></h3>
<p>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (this includes the EU, Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein). Your information will be processed by staff where it is necessary to fulfil an order, process payment details or provide you with other support services.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its security and when giving us your information you do so at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p>We will hold your information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us. If you change your registration profile to opt-out of receiving communications from us, your record will stay on the system so we can ensure that we do not contact you in the future. If you wish to cancel your registration with any of Immediate’s websites, you may do so by contacting us using the details available in the ‘Contact Us’ section of the website or by emailing dataprotection@immediate.co.uk.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><b>How we use your information</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">We will use your information for a number of purposes including the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>to send you carefully selected special offers and promotions from the service you are using/title you have purchased and from Immediate Media Company Group by email, post, telephone, SMS or push notification (where applicable and permitted by the app store you use). You can opt-out of these marketing messages at any time by sending an email to privacy@immediate.co.uk, including your full name, user name (if applicable) postcode, details of the service you are using and/or magazine subscription information. Please note that it may take up to two weeks to implement this change in your preferences. You will always be given a straightforward way to opt out of our marketing messages each time you receive a communication from us.</li>
<li>we may use your IP address to identify your location, the number of visits from different countries and also to block disruptive use;</li>
<li>if we need to contact you for reasons related to the service you have signed up for e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance;</li>
<li>to tell you about changes to our service;</li>
<li>to contact you about a submission or contribution you have made to our websites, message boards or magazines, including any content you provide;</li>
<li>to personalise or improve the way our content and advertising is presented to you online:</li>
<li>to analyse and improve the services we offer e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience or the most relevant information;</li>
<li>to manage our competitions and contact the winners;</li>
<li>to meet product orders, requests for services or information and to process payments and any other requests you make of us;</li>
<li>to keep our records up to date;</li>
<li>to invite you to participate in surveys about our services (participation is always voluntary);</li>

<li>where you have given us your permission, to pass your information to carefully selected organisations to allow them to tell you about their special offers or products and services that may be of interest to you.</li>

</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Sharing your information with others</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Generally, we will only use your information within the Immediate Media Company group of companies in order to provide the service/product you have requested.</span></p>
<p>We will only disclose your information to third parties (including Immediate Media Company group companies and other trusted companies) with your consent or where we need to do so in order to provide a service you have requested or improve the service and advertising that your receive (on both our websites and apps, and third party websites and apps).
