        <p class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Reviewing, changing or deleting information</p>
        <p>The User may use his/her rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition to the treatment of his/her personal data by sending a petition to adbusinesscrownsolutions@gmail.com or by letter to AD BUSINESS CROWN SOLUTIONS, SL located at Calle General Ramirez de Madrid 8, 28020, Madrid, Spain.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Not Track.</strong>  Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
        <p class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;6. How do we keep the information we collect secure?</p>
        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  We also limit access to personal information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs.  However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.</p>
        <p class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;7. How long do we keep the information we collect?</p>
        <p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request.  We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.</p>
