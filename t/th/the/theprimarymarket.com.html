    <strong id="2">2.	Your acknowledgment of this policy</strong>
    <p>
      This Privacy and Cookie Policy (“Privacy and Cookie Policy”) details how your Personal Information collected via the Site is used and processed by Wazimo.
      BY ENTERING, CONNECTING TO, ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE OR HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME AWARE OF AND AGREE (IN JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH CONSENT IS REQUIRED)
      TO THIS PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY AND Wazimo’S PRACTICES DESCRIBED THEREIN, INCLUDING THE PROCESSING (INCLUDING COLLECTING, USING, DISCLOSING, RETAINING OR DISPOSING) OF YOUR INFORMATION UNDER

    </p>
    <strong id="3">3.	Which information may we collect about Users?</strong>
    <p>
      We collect from Users of our Site, two types of data and information:<br>
      3.1.	Non-personal Information. The first type is non-identifiable and anonymous information. Non-personal Information, which is being gathered, consists of technical information and
      behavioral information that does not pertain to a specific individual (“Non-Personal Information”).
      You may access and browse the Site without disclosing personal information, although, like most websites, we passively collect certain Non-Personal Information from your devices,
      including:<br>(i) technical information such as the type and version of your device and its operating system, the type of browser, screen resolution, device browser and keyboard language,
      Wi-Fi connectivity and the type and name of your device and/or browser, etc; and<br>(ii) behavioral information which may include the User’s click-stream on the Site, the activities of the
      User on the Site and additional information of a similar nature (collectively, “Technical and Behavioral Information”). We may also use third-party service providers such as Quantcast and
      Google Analytics to obtain detailed analytics on the device and the User's behavior on the Site.
      Please note that we or our third party service providers will collect such Technical and Behavioral Information by using certain technologies such as Cookies (as further detailed below under
      Section 12 "Cookies and Similar Technologies").<br>
      3.2.	Personal Information. The other type of information we collect is individually identifiable information. To put it simply, this information identifies an individual or is of a private
      and/or sensitive nature, such as your contact information (“Personal Information”), including:<br>
      3.2.1.	Personal Information which is provided voluntary:<br>
      •	Communications with Wazimo: Personal Information you provide us as part of any communications with Wazimo, by any means, including by approaching our customer services.<br>
      •	Contact Details: when you provide us with your contact details via the Contact Form on the Site, we will ask you to provide us some or all of the following details: full name, e-mail address
      and title. A free text message may also be provided. You may also voluntarily join our mailing list by providing us with your email address.<br>
      3.2.2.	Personal Information collected via technology:<br>
      •	Geolocation data: while using the Site we will access, collect, process, monitor and/or remotely store "geolocation data", including through the collection of IP addresses and other similar
      information to determine your location for the purpose of providing a localized version of our Site and for security purposes.<br>
