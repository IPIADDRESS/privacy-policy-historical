<p align="justify">Company/Seller  (herein referred to as "this Site") strives to offer its visitors the  many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and  personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your  name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of  this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to  any unauthorized third party. <strong>WE HATE SPAM!</strong> We will NEVER sell, rent,  barter or share your personal information with anyone!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How We Gather Information From Users</strong><br>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the  activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access  to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as  newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you  participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and  other interactive areas of our site, where applicable. Like most Web sites,  this Site may collect information automatically and through the use of  electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may  log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to  recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the  cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to  re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of  times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we  adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other  means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for  example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you  may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to  re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the  site's features according to your preferences.<br>
<br>
<strong>What We Do With Information Collected</strong><br>
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. Aggregated Information  (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways.  For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar  information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services  (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most  attractive). We may occasionally provide limited personal information to  trustworthy third parties for direct mail offers and to make our future  marketing efforts more efficient, but you can tell us not to. Such information  includes your name and mailing address or other information where. This  information may be combined with demographic information and past purchase  information. We will never include your email address or credit card  information. We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on this  Site to communicate with you about your registration and customization  preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products  offered by this Site and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by this Site may also be used for  other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,  troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of  sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third  parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your  information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we  continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other  companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among  the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a  court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so  by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or  to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.  Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such  cases.<br>
<br>
The use of information as described herein may or may not be how information  that is collected is customarily used by this site. While actual use of any  information collected may be used quite conservatively, you must assume that it  is not.
