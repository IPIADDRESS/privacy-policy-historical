    <strong>Information Sharing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal
    Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with
    third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court
    order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce
    our terms of service.
    </p>
    <p>Unless you opt-out, we may share your Personal Information with Haymarket's
    affiliates, partners and third parties licensed or permitted to access your Personal
    Information by any of the foregoing.
    </p>
    <p>We may share information about your engagement with any of our services including receipt and/or
    action with our emails, activity on our sites including content and/or advertisements viewed and
    actions taken or personal information otherwise provided by you.
    </p>
    <p>We may invite you to participate in industry-sponsored programs which present you with branded
    sponsor-selected materials  to provide clinical information to physicians about medical conditions,
    options for treatment and recommended products.  Your invitation will use the Personal Information
    that you have provided or that we have obtained from third parties, and non-personally identifiable
    information which we gather from your site visits by the use of cookies or other tracking
    technologies.  Sponsor programs will be affiliated with your area of specialty and any specific
    interests you have shared with us.   Not everyone will qualify for an invitation to participate;
    conversely you may be invited to register or participate in more than one program.  Haymarket will provide
    information, personally identified information or in aggregated form, about your participation in
    specific  programs to the program sponsor or their representatives.  This helps our industry
    sponsors to improve clinical education and information and communicate with you in a more
    targeted way.  If you interact with any of our sponsors directly, their Privacy Policy and practices will
    apply.
    </p>
    <p>We will share your Personal Information with our third party suppliers who need to process you data
    to deliver the services you have requested or consented to receive.  These suppliers are required
    under contract not to use Personal Information supplied by us other than to provide the services requested by
    us and to guarantee to our satisfaction that they have sufficient processes in place to ensure the
    security of your data whilst it is in their care.  You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal
    Information with our contractors and third party service supplies for the purpose of providing
    services to you.
    </p>
    <p>Haymarket will share user data with the accredited provider(s) of CME/CE activities
    in which users participate, and/or medical education and communications
    companies who assisted in the development of CME/CE activities in which users
    participate.
    </p>
    <p>In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide
    lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Haymarket products
    to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send
    on Haymarket's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to
    our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be
    supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. If you
    continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:custserve@haymarketmedia.com">custserve@haymarketmedia.com</a>
