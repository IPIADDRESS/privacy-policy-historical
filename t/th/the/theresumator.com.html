		<h3 class="text18 normal">This notice sets forth our Privacy Policy. By agreeing to the Terms of Use 
			required to use the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this 
			Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”). Capitalized terms used but not defined 
			in the Privacy Policy have the meanings ascribed to them in the <a href="/home/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</h3>
			
		<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
		<p>When you visit our Site or use our Service you may provide us with two types of 
			information: personal information you actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”) 
			and non-personally identifiable information collected, in a way not visible to you, on 
			an aggregate basis as you and others use our Site (“Passive Information”).
			These two types of information are referred to collectively as “Subscriber 
			Information.”</p>
			
		<h2>Active Information You Provide</h2>
		<p>In order to use the Service, we require you to disclose the following information: 
			full legal name, full company name and a valid e-mail address. Additionally, 
			if you choose to post information through our Service or engage in email, regular 
			mail, telephone or other contact with us, we may retain information disclosed 
			thereby as well.</p>
			
		<h2>Passive Information Collected</h2>
		<p>Our Site and the Service utilize a standard technology called “cookies” to collect 
			information about how our Site and Service is used. Passive Information gathered 
			may include but is not limited to the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, 
			time spent at our Site, a logging of activities, and the sites visited just before 
			and just after our Site.</p>
			
		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allow web servers to recognize 
			the computer used to access a Site. They are small pieces of data that that we 
			transfer to your computer's hard drive to enable our systems to recognize your 
			browser, simplify subsequent interactions with our Site and streamline your use 
			of the Site. </p>
			
		<h2>Use of Information Collected</h2>
		<p>Individuals we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction, use 
			Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing 
			Subscriber services such as support, and making available other products or services 
			we think may be of interest to our users and to job candidates. We may use the Active 
			Information or Passive Information you provide to us to contact you about changes to 
			our Site and Service, new services, features or products we offer, or other information 
			we think you might find valuable, as well as to provide or enhance features of our 
			Site and Service. If at any time you do not wish to receive such information from us, 
			please send us an email to that effect to <script type="text/javascript">document.write( unescape('%3C%61%20%68%72%65%66%3D%22%6D%61%69%6C%74%6F%3A%73%75%70%70%6F%72%74%40%74%68%65%72%65%73%75%6D%61%74%6F%72%2E%63%6F%6D%22%3E%73%75%70%70%6F%72%74%40%74%68%65%72%65%73%75%6D%61%74%6F%72%2E%63%6F%6D%3C%2F%61%3E'));</script><a href="mailto:support@theresumator.com">support@theresumator.com</a>.</p>
		<p>We also use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance 
			and design our Site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use. Additionally, 
			cookies help us know information about how many people visit our Site, when they 
			visit and how they use our service. We do not connect any of this information to 
			your personal information or email address. </p>
		
		<h3>Sharing Information with Others</h3>
		<p>In addition to as described above, we may share Subscriber Information with others 
			in the following situations without additional notice to or consent by you:</p>
		
		<h3>Business Transactions</h3>
		<p>As we continue to develop our business, we might become 
			involved in financing transactions or business transactions involving the sale or 
			license of our assets or business units. In either case, Subscriber Information 
			often is disclosed on a confidential basis or is one of the transferred business 
			assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy 
			(unless, of course, the Subscriber consents otherwise). Also, in the event the 
			Company is merged with another company or acquired, or substantially all of its 
			assets are acquired, Subscriber Information will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
		<p>Protection of Charlton Ventures and Others: We release Subscriber Information when 
			we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or legitimate requests of 
			law enforcement officials; enforce or apply our <a href="/home/terms/">Terms of Use</a> 
			and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our 
			users, job candidates or others. This includes exchanging information with other 
			companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This 
			does not, however, include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing 
			personally identifiable information from Subscribers for commercial purposes in 
			violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may disclose anonymous Passive Information 
			about user habits, characteristics and user patterns, based on aggregate user statistics 
			to advertisers on our Site or others.</p>
		
		<h2>Security of Subscriber Information</h2>
		<p>We secure your Subscriber Information by using commercially reasonable, industry-standard 
			measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss, disclosure 
			or destruction thereof. However, even very good security measures may fail to prevent 
			computer hacking or other breaches of security, and we can provide no guarantees that 
			the same will not occur. Additionally, our postings on this Site and other communications 
			you may have with us via email or regular mail may not be secure unless we advise you 
			that security measures are in place prior to your sending information. Therefore, if 
			you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the risk of 
			doing so and we request that you do not send or post sensitive information through 
			those means.</p>
		
		<h2>Other Websites</h2>
		<p>You may be able to access other websites through our Site and/or Service. When you do 
			so you are thereby subject to those other sites policies regarding privacy and data 
			collection and you should read those sites’ privacy policies to make sure you agree 
			to them before using such sites. When you choose to visit such sites, you should read 
			their privacy policies and terms of use to make sure you agree with them.</p>
		
		<h2>Opting Out/Correcting or Deleting Personal Information</h2>
		<p>If you desire not to receive information about products or services we think may be of 
			interest to you or if you wish to delete or correct your information, please visit 
			the Account screen.</p>
		
		<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p class="bottom0">Our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service may change from time to time.  Charlton Ventures 
			reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by 
			posting a notice on the Site, or by sending you a notice via e-mail. You will be 
			responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your 
			use of the Site and/or the Service following such notification constitutes Subscriber's 
			acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.  Unless 
			stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have 
			about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, and will never 
			materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of Subscriber 
			information collected in the past without the consent of affected Subscribers.</p>
