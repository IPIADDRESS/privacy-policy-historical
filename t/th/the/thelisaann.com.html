This policy  explains how we intend to treat your Personal Information.<br>
  Brand Danger  strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed  to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to  country, Brand Danger intends to adhere to the principles set forth  in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your  Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an  "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In  other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no  matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.<br>
