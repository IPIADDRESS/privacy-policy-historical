<h2>3. Use of information collected</h2>
<p>The Company uses Data about CustomerInsight Customers to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services.</p>
<p>The Company also uses Data about CustomerInsight Attendees to plan and host corporate events, host online surveys, focus groups, forums and social networks in which event attendees may participate, and to populate online profiles for Attendees on the Company’s Web sites. We only collect personal information that is strictly necessary for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. Generally we collect personal information from Attendees directly or from our business partners such as new home builders, warranty providers, or industry regulators. This information could be collected in person, over the telephone, through the mail, or by electronic means, under the assumption that the builder, warranty provider or industry regulator has obtained the Attendees consent for us to obtain their customer’s personal information and conduct research on behalf of that organization. We only collect, use, or disclose personal information for the purposes we believe the Customers and Attendees would consider appropriate under the circumstances. Both Customer and Attendee’s knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information unless permitted or required by law. Of course, subject to reasonable and lawful limits, any Customer or Attendee can chose not to provide us with some or all personal information. However this choice may prevent us from providing the product, service or information that has been requested.</p>
<p>The Company may also use Data about CustomerInsight Customers and Data about CustomerInsight Attendees for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding the Company, its affiliates, and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. CustomerInsight may also use comments provided in survey responses on www.homeownermark.com for builder profiles, however only first names and community name may be used, unless the Attendee has chosen to remain confidential in which case “Confidential” will appear instead of the first name.</p>
<p>CustomerInsight uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications and collect payment from prospective Customers and Attendees.</p>
<p>CustomerInsight uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites. The Company may also use Web Site Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data about CustomerInsight Customers and Data about CustomerInsight Attendees to provide personalized information about the Company.
