            </span><span class="c0">TPL takes every effort to protect our customers' information
                both on and offline. &nbsp;Sensitive data is encrypted using the best encryption
                software in the industry and is further protected by a robust firewall. &nbsp;Offline,
                your data is protected by a strict Privacy Policy for our employees. &nbsp;Only
                approved and qualified staff has access to our secured databases and in order to
                perform specific lottery-related tasks, each must first provide a personalized password
                prior to being allowed access to customer data. &nbsp;Once logged into the secure
                database, employee actions are “key-logged”, which allows us to track
                who accessed what data and what they did with the data exactly. All customer data
                is stored in our secure servers within a locked cabinet inside a secure hosting
                facility. &nbsp;No one within the secure facility has access to our data.</span>
