				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">Protecting your personal details on theAA.com</p>
				<p>www.theAA.com is brought to you by the AA. The AA believes it is important to protect your privacy and we are committed to giving you a personalised service that meets your needs in a way that also protects your privacy. This policy explains how we may collect information about you and then use it to meet your needs. It also explains some of the security measures we take to protect your privacy, and tells you certain things we will not do. You should read this policy in conjunction with the <a href="termcondition.html">Web Site Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
				<p>When we first obtain personal information from you, or when you take a new service or product from us, we will give you the opportunity to tell us if you do or do not want to receive information from us about other services or products (as applicable). You can normally do this by ticking a box on an application form or contract. You may change your mind at any time by emailing us at the address below.</p>
				<p>Some of the personal information we hold about you may be 'sensitive personal data' within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 - for example, information about your health or ethnic origin.</p>				
				
				<h2>1. Collecting Information</h2>
				<p>We may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>from you when you agree to take a service or product from us, in which case this may include your contact details, date of birth, how you will pay for the product or service and your bank details </li>
					<li>from you when you contact us with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, in which case this may tell us something about how you use our services </li>
					<li>from documents that are available to the public, such as the electoral register</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>2. Using Information</h2>
				<p><strong>2.1</strong> Information you provide or we hold about you (whether or not under our contract (or contracts) with you) may be used by us or our agents (or both) to:</p>
				<ol class="withalpha">
					<li>identify you when you contact us;</li>
					<li>help identify accounts, services and/or products for which you may be eligible from time to time. That identification process may be carried out by automatic means using a scoring system, which takes account of the information you have provided, any information we hold about you and information from third party agencies (including credit reference agencies). The scoring system will give points for each piece of relevant information and add these up to produce a score. </li>
					<li>help administer, and contact you about improved administration of, any accounts, services and products we have provided before, or provide now or in the future; </li>
					<li>carry out marketing analysis and customer profiling (including with transactional information) and create statistical and testing information; </li>
					<li>help to prevent and detect fraud or loss; and </li>
					<li>contact you in any way (including mail, email, phone or text or multimedia messages) about services and products offered by us, and selected partners. We will only contact you in this way if you have previously indicated your consent.</li>
				</ol>				

				<p><strong>2.2</strong> We may allow other people and organisations to use information we hold about you for the purpose of providing services you have asked for, as part of the process of selling one or more of our businesses, or if we have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings. From time to time, these other people and organisations may be outside the European Economic Area in countries that do not have the same standards of protection for personal data as the UK.</p>

				<p><strong>2.3</strong> We may monitor and record communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) for quality assurance, legal, regulatory and training purposes.</p>

				<p><strong>2.4</strong> Where you give us information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the information set out in this document, and that they have not objected to the uses of their personal information described in it. Where you give us sensitive data about yourself or others (such as health details or details of any criminal convictions of members of your household), you agree (and confirm that the relevant subject of the information has agreed) to us processing such information in the manner set out in this document.</p>

				<h2>3. Protecting Information</h2>
				<p>We have strict security measures to protect personal information. This includes following certain procedures (for example, checking your identity when you phone us) and encrypting (encoding) data on our web sites.</p>

				<h2>4. The Internet</h2>
				<p><strong>4.1</strong> If you communicate with us using the Internet, we may occasionally email you about our services and products. When you first give us personal information through our web site, we will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you would prefer us not to contact you by email. However, you can always send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your mind.</p>
				
				<p><strong>4.2</strong> Please remember that communications over the Internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a web site), are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before they are delivered - this is the nature of the Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</p>
				
				<p><strong>4.3</strong> We may use 'cookies' to monitor how people use our site. This helps us to understand how our customers and potential customers use our web site so we can develop and improve the design, layout and function of the sites. A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive, which records how you have used a web site. This means that when you go back to that web site, it can give you tailored options based on the information it has stored about your last visit. You can normally alter the settings of your browser to prevent it from accepting cookies.</p>
				
				<p><strong>4.4</strong> If you do not want us to use cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to tell you when a web site tries to put a cookie on your computer. However, you may not be able to use some of the products or services on our web site without cookies.</p>
