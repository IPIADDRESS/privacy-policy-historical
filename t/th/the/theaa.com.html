<span>Introduction</span>
</h3>
<div class="displayInline"><p>The AA Group ('we' 'us') means AA plc, together with any entity in which AA plc directly or indirectly has at least a 50% shareholding. The AA Group use a variety of well known brand and trading names including, but not limited to, AA, BSM, Go Travel Insurance, 1Stop Travel Insurance and Peak Performance. We may transfer your personal information among the members of the AA Group for the purposes contemplated in this privacy policy. You can obtain details of the relevant members by writing to the AA Data Protection Officer, The AA, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.</p>
<p>The AA Group are committed to protecting your privacy. We comply with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998, and aim to maintain best-practice standards in our processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>We may provide more specific information about how we use personal and/or sensitive personal data in our product or service specific documentation, such as any policy documentation or literature. If there is any inconsistency or conflict between this privacy policy and that product or service specific documentation, that specific documentation will prevail.</p></div>

<h3>
<span>How we use your information</span>
</h3>
<div class="displayInline"><p>We use the information we receive from you, together with information we have obtained in the course of our relationship with you (including in relation to goods and/or services we provide to you, and/or your use of those goods and/or services), to provide goods and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise information sent to you and for other purposes specified in this privacy policy. Examples of how we may personalise information include using your information in generating an insurance quote for you or notifying you when we will be delivering certain products in your area.</p>
<p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes, but we may share your information with third parties so they can market AA branded products and services (even where those products and services are provided by a third party).</p>
<p>We store the information you provide to us, including information provided via forms you complete on our website, and information which we may collect from your browsing. Our servers, in common with nearly all web servers, log each page that is downloaded from the site.</p>
<p>Any new information you provide to us may be used to update an existing record we hold for you. If you provide a work email address we will not be responsible for third parties who are authorised to access your work email address having access to any communications we send.</p>
<p>To help us prevent fraud and money laundering, your details may be submitted to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations where your records may be searched. We will also conduct a search with a credit reference bureau to assist us in providing a quote, and to check which payment options we can make available to you. A copy of this search will be left on your credit file but will not affect your credit score. Where we are providing a motor insurance quotation this search will be noted on your credit file and may be reflected in your credit score. We may carry out similar credit searches before sending you information about our products and services, to ensure that we only send you information about products and services that is likely to be of interest to you.</p>
<p>If you apply for one of our insurance or financial services products (such as a credit card or loan), we, or the supplier of the product, will search your record at a credit reference agency and may check your details with fraud prevention agencies. The precise nature of these processes is explained fully when you apply.</p>
<p>Third parties may deliver some of our products to you, or provide all or part of the service requested by you. In these instances, while the information you provide will be disclosed to them, it will only be used for the administration and provision of the relevant product or service (including, for example, verification of any quote given to you, and claims processing), underwriting and pricing purposes as appropriate, testing, and to maintain management information for business analysis.</p>
<p>We ask for your home, mobile phone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to contact you about relevant products or services, to contact you if there is a problem with your order, or there is another reasonable reason for doing so.</p>
<p>We make outbound phone calls for a number of reasons relating to our many products and services, including breakdown cover and insurance. We are fully committed to the regulations set out by Ofcom and follow strict processes to ensure we comply with them.</p>
<p>If you provide us with credit or debit card details in order to pay for a product or service, we will keep such details secure and ensure that the details are only used further with your consent and/or for the purposes of any appropriate refunds.</p>
<p>If you use your AA card to obtain discounts from third party organisations, we may receive information from those organisations about your purchases. We may use this information for market research and analysis purposes, and to send you marketing we think you'll find of interest (in accordance with your marketing preferences).</p>
<p>When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, phone numbers and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.</p>
<p>We may also use the information we collect to notify you by post, phone, mobile phone, email and SMS about new or existing services, products and special offers we think you'll find of interest (in accordance with your marketing preferences).</p>
<p>Generally, by providing the requested data you consent to us using that data for administrative purposes and for informing you of other products and services by letter, SMS, phone and/or email. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website.</p>
<p>If you make a donation to the AA Charitable Trust, your data will not be used for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Each time you receive electronic marketing information or a message, you have the option to decline to receive further marketing information from us. This is known as an 'opt-out'.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise the opt-out for receiving marketing information from the AA, please use the option in the relevant electronic message or write to AA Data Protection Officer, The AA, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.</p>
<p>If you have more than one address or email address, please make sure to notify any changes to your preferences for each address or email address you have registered with us.</p>
<p>We may use your information (and contact details) for market research and analysis in order to evaluate, assess and improve the products and services we provide, and to identify trends and popular products and services. This may include contacting you to take part in customer satisfaction and feedback surveys.</p>
<p>As required by the Data Protection Act 1998, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given to us.</p>
<p>If we provide information to a third party (either a provider of a product or service, or an external data processing agency such as a mailing house) we will exercise strict control over the third party contractually, typically requiring it and any of its agents and/or suppliers to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="BulletListYellowDot">maintain the security and confidentiality of the information, and restrict access to those of its own employees</li>
<li class="BulletListYellowDot">only use the data for the purpose agreed with us, and prevent it being used for any other purpose by any other party</li>
<li class="BulletListYellowDot">refrain from communicating with you other than concerning the product or service in question</li>
<li class="BulletListYellowDot">return the data to us at the conclusion of any contract term, and destroy or delete any copies made of all or any part of the information unless copies are needed to be kept to comply with applicable law or regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we will restrict the information disclosed to the absolute minimum necessary, for example, to provide the product or service.</p>
<p>Our own security procedures mean that we may occasionally have to request proof of identity or check your presence on the electoral roll.</p>
<p>In the event of phone calls from you, we also reserve the right to ask security questions (which we in our sole discretion deem appropriate) in order to satisfy ourselves that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>If you contact us electronically we may collect your electronic identifier, eg Internet protocol (IP) address or phone number supplied by your service provider. This is to identify any repeat website visits, fraudulent behaviour or mystery shoppers using our websites.</p></div>

<a name="Yourconsent"></a>
<h3>
<span>Your consent</span>
</h3>
<div class="displayInline"><p>When you provide any data to us we will endeavour to make it clear why we need it, and, where required by law, obtain your consent to our use of it. Sometimes we may need to process sensitive personal data about you (examples include medical history and motoring convictions). When this is required we will (to the extent required by law) obtain your consent to that processing.</p>
<p>Where we deem appropriate, we may allow a customer to give their spouse's, partner's or other relevant person's consent. If you provide consent on behalf of another person, you must ensure that you have their authorisation to do so; we reserve the right to request confirmation or to otherwise verify that you have that authorisation.</p>
<p>Subsequent to your purchase of a product or service, we may enter into an arrangement for that product or service to be provided by a new third party. If this happens, the terms and conditions of your contract with us will provide that you consent to the transfer to and processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data by the new provider, subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and associated regulations.</p>
<p>If you are entitled to breakdown service under AA membership, you consent to the AA Group keeping you up to date with the AA Rewards discount scheme or similar scheme available from time to time. Under this scheme, as part of the benefit of being a member, the AA Group will, through the AA members' magazine, email or otherwise, give you membership information and details of any discounts or offers it may negotiate from time to time on behalf of its members. You will continue to receive this information even if you opt-out of marketing generally.</p></div>

We're keen to find out what you like and dislike â€“ your feedback plays a key role in helping us improve this site. We use many techniques to follow your use of the site and provide you with a customised experience. The main and best known technique is by using what are known as 'cookies'.</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong> Cookies are small data files that a website will put on your device. The data contained in the cookie can be retrieved by that website (or another website that can read the cookie) when you visit the relevant site. Cookies cannot affect your device, but they do collect information that can be used to enhance the site. For example, a cookie can remember the items that you have placed into your shopping basket, or it can ensure you get the offer you requested. Typically, these will be 'session' cookies, which expire as soon as you leave the site.</p>
<p>Other cookies can tell us if you come back. These are 'persistent cookies', which expire after a period of time unless you delete them from your device. We use them to help customise the site and to do things such as display relevant advertising on the websites you visit based on your visit to our website.</p>
<p>Some cookies enable sites to work, while others help us learn about what people are browsing for.</p></div>

They may remember where you are so you can get tailored information, or remember changes you have made to help you browse, such as increasing the text size.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong> If you ask for services based on your location, we sometimes store a cookie so that next time you visit you wonâ€™t have to tell <span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #6c6752; mso-fareast-font-family: ">us your location again</span>.</p>

<span>Disclosure of information to third parties, and cross-border transfers</span>
</h3>
<div class="displayInline"><p>As previously mentioned, we do not sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes, but we may share your information with third parties so they can market AA branded products and services (even where those products and services are provided by a third party).</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal data to third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>a) to fulfil your orders for a product or service or information in the event that third parties deliver the relevant product or service or information. For example, if you take out an insurance policy provided by a third party, they will need your details in order to administer the policy, verify the quote given to you and process any claims;</p>
<p>b) where third parties administer or provide part or all of a product or service. For example, if you take out an insurance policy provided by a third party, we may pass your personal information to that party in connection with the continued provision of the policy;</p>
<p>c) for underwriting, pricing, insurance rating analysis and testing purposes, and to maintain management information for business analysis;</p>
<p>d) where the third party provides services to us; or</p>
<p>e) where we provide products or services to you pursuant to or in connection with your relationship with a third party, in which case we may share information about you with the third party. For example, if you receive breakdown cover as part of an added value bank account, we may share your personal information with the bank.</p>
<p>In connection with the above disclosures and data sharing arrangements, we may receive personal information about you from these third parties and supplement our own records with this information, and use this information for the purposes contemplated in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose personal information held by us about our members and customers to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party (or subject to a corporate reorganisation), personal information held by us about will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #6c6752; mso-fareast-font-family: ">we may be required to pass</span> on your information to the police or any other statutory or regulatory authority, and, in some cases, exemptions may apply under the Data Protection Act 1998 whereby we can legitimately release personal data, eg to prevent or detect crime or in connection with legal proceedings.</p>
<p>See also <strong>How we use your information</strong> above for information on how we may exchange personal data with third parties to help us prevent fraud and money laundering, to assist us in providing a quote, or to check which payment options we can make available to you, and (where appropriate) to ensure that we only send you information about products and services that is likely to be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-border transfers of information</strong><br>From time to time the AA Group may use service providers and organisations outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to process personal information for the purposes contemplated by this privacy policy. The laws of some non-EEA countries do not provide the same level of protection for personal data as the laws of the UK.</p>
<p>Where we transfer your personal data to such countries, we will take steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place to safeguard your personal data as required by the Data Protection Act 1998.</p></div>
