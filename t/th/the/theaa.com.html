		<p class="subtitle">Saga and AA Group data protection privacy policy</p>
		
			
			<p>Last updated: January 2008</p>


           	
			
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>'Saga' means the Saga Group of companies and all companies within the Saga Group resident anywhere in the world.</p>


           	
			
			<p>'AA' means the AA Group of companies and Automobile Association Personal Finance Limited (a joint venture company with Halifax Bank of Scotland). A list of the companies within the AA Group can be obtained from the AA address below.</p>


           	
			
			<p>Saga and AA (We) are committed to protecting your privacy. We comply with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data.</p>


           	
			
			<h2>How we use information you provide us</h2>
<p>We use the information we receive from you to provide goods and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise our information sent to you. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.</p>


           	
			
			<p>We store all the information you provide us, including information provided via forms you complete on our website, and information which we may collect from your browsing. Our server, in common with nearly all web servers, logs each page that is downloaded from the site.</p>


           	
			
			<p>Examples of how we may personalise information might include preparing an insurance quote for you, working out which departure airports are near to you or when we will be delivering certain products in your area.</p>


           	
			
			<p>Third parties may deliver some of our products to you or provide all or part of the service requested by you. In these instances, whilst the information you provide will be disclosed to them, it will only be used for the administration of the service provided (including for example claims processing), underwriting and pricing purposes as appropriate, testing, and to maintain management information for business analysis.</p>


           	
			
			<p>If you apply for the Saga Visa Card or the AA Master Card, we, or the supplier of the card, will search your record at a credit reference agency. If you apply for other financial services and/or products, a check of your details with fraud prevention agencies may be necessary. The precise nature of these processes is explained fully when you apply.</p>


           	
			
			<p>We ask for your home, mobile telephone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to contact you about relevant products or services, to contact you if there is a problem with your order, or there is another genuine reason for doing so. If you provide us with credit or debit card details in order to pay for a service or product, we will keep such details secure and ensure that the details are only used further with your consent and/or for the purposes of any appropriate refunds.</p>


           	
			
			<p>In respect of Saga Zone, (Saga's free web-based service for meeting past, present and future friends) certain details and information provided by you will be monitored from time to time and certain data such as messages sent by you will be retained by us for up to 12 months in accordance with the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001. Such details may be disclosed to the police and law enforcement agencies for the purpose of fraud detection, crime prevention and national security. We also reserve the right to move or edit messages or materials that we, in our sole discretion, deem to violate Saga Zone's Code of Conduct as set out in its terms and conditions or any applicable content guidelines, or which in any way is otherwise unacceptable.</p>


           	
			
			<p>When participating in Saga Zone's activities such as discussions or reunion requests, your contributions will often be identifiable. You will be able to see whether this is the case in the appropriate area of the website.</p>


           	
			
			<p>When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, telephone numbers and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.</p>


           	
			
			<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you by post, telephone, mobile telephone, email and SMS about new or existing Saga and AA services, products and special offers we think you'll find valuable.</p>


           	
			
			<p>Generally by providing the requested data you consent to Saga and AA using that data for administrative purposes and for informing you of other  products and services by letter, SMS, telephone and/or email. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functional</p></div></div></div></body></html>
