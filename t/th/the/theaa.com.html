		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">Protecting your personal details on theAA.com</p>
		
			
			<p>Last updated: October 2005
<br><br>
www.theAA.com is brought to you by the AA. The AA believes it is important to protect your privacy and we are committed to giving you a personalised service that meets your needs in a way that also protects your privacy. This policy explains how we may collect information about you and then use it to meet your needs. It also explains some of the security measures we take to protect your privacy, and tells you certain things we will not do. You should read this policy in conjunction with the <a href="/termsandconditions/termcondition.html">Web Site Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>


           	
			
			<p>When we first obtain personal information from you, or when you take a new service or product from us, we will give you the opportunity to tell us if you do or do not want to receive information from us about other services or products (as applicable). You can normally do this by ticking a box on an application form or contract. You may change your mind at any time by emailing us at the address below.</p>


           	
			
			<p>Some of the personal information we hold about you may be 'sensitive personal data' within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 - for example, information about your health or ethnic origin.</p>


           	
			
			<h2>1. Collecting Information</h2>
<p>We may collect personal information about you from a number of sources, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>from you when you agree to take a service or product from us, in which case this may include your contact details, date of birth, how you will pay for the product or service and your bank details </li>
<li>from you when you contact us with an enquiry or in response to a communication from us, in which case this may tell us something about how you use our services </li>
<li>from documents that are available to the public, such as the electoral register</li>
</ul>


           	
			
			<h2>2. Using Your Personal Information</h2>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> The AA group of companies* (including the Automobile Association Personal Finance Limited) ('we') will use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ol class="withalpha">
<li>identify you when you contact us;</li>
<li>help identify accounts, services and/or products which you could have from us or selected partners from time to time. We may do this by automatic means using a scoring system, which uses the information you have provided, any information we hold about you and information from third party agencies (including credit reference agencies).</li>
<li>help administer, and contact you about improved administration of, any accounts, services and products we have provided before, or provide now or in the future;</li>
<li>carry out marketing analysis and customer profiling (including with transactional information), conduct research, including creating statistical and testing information;</li>
<li>help to prevent and detect fraud or loss; and</li>
<li>contact you in any way (including mail, email, telephone, visit, text or multimedia messages) about products and services offered by us and selected partners unless you have previously asked us not to do so.</li>
<li>keep you up to date with our AA member benefit scheme under which, as part of your membership benefits, we will give you membership information and details of discounts and offers we negotiate from time to time on behalf of our members. If you do not wish to receive this benefit please write to our Data Protection Manager at the address given below.</li>
</ol>
<p>* A list of companies forming the AA group of companies is available from the Data Protection Manager at the address given below.</p>


           	
			
			<p><strong>2.2</strong> We may allow other people and organisations to use information we hold about you for the purpose of providing services you have asked for, as part of the process of selling one or more of our businesses, or if we have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings. From time to time, these other people and organisations may be outside the European Economic Area in countries that do not have the same standards of protection for personal data as the UK.</p>


           	
			
			<p><strong>2.3</strong> We may monitor and record communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) for quality assurance and compliance.</p>


           	
			
			<p></p><p><strong>2.4</strong> We will check your details with fraud prevention agencies.  If you provide false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.  We and other organisations may use and search these records to:</p>
<ol class="withalpha">
<li>help make decisions about credit and credit related services for you and members of your household;</li>
<li>help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims for you and other members of your household;</li>
<li>trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies; and</li>
<li>check your identity to prevent money laundering unless you give us other satisfactory proof of identity.</li></ol><p></p>


           	
			
			<p><strong>2.5</strong> Where you give us information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the information set out in this document, and that they have not objected to such use of their personal information. Where you give us sensitive data about yourself or another person  (such as health details or details of any criminal convictions) you agree (and confirm that the other person has agreed) to our processing such information in the manner set out in this document.</p>


           	
			
			<p><strong>2.6</strong> In connection with this contract we, and other companies in our group, may carry out credit and fraud prevention checks with one or more licensed credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. We and they may keep a record of the search. Information held about you by these agencies may be linked to records relating to other people living at the same address with whom you are financially linked. These records will also be taken into account in credit and fraud prevention checks. Information from your application and payment details of your account will be recorded with one or more of these agencies and may be shared with other organisations to help make credit and insurance decisions about you and members of your household with whom you are financially linked and for debt collection and fraud prevention. This includes those who have moved house and who have missed payments.</p>


           	
			
			<p>If you provide false or inaccurate information to us and we suspect fraud, we will record this and may share it with other people and organisations. We, and other credit and insurance organisations, may also use technology to detect and prevent fraud.</p>


           	
			
			<p>If you need details of those credit agencies and fraud prevention agencies from which we obtain and with which we record information about you, please write to our Data Protection Compliance Manager at The Automobile Association, Fanum House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4EA.</p>


           	
			
			<h2>3. Protecting Information</h2>
<p>We have strict security measures to protect personal information. This includes following certain procedures (for example, checking your identity when you phone us) and encrypting (encoding) data on our web sites.</p>


           	
			
			<h2>4. The Internet</h2>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> If you communicate with us using the Internet, we may occasionally email you about our services and products. When you first give us personal information through our web site, we will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you would prefer us not to contact you by email. However, you can always send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your mind.</p>


           	
			
			<p><strong>4.2</strong> Please remember that communications over the Internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a web site), are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before they are delivered - this is the nature of the Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</p>
