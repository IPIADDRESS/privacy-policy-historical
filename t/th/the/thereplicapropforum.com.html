<h2>3.<strong> MPS COLLECTED  INFORMATION</strong></h2>
<p>When users  access the Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable  information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection  to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer  and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other  software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or  other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device  or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to  it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser  cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which  are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique  identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a  web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access  information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may  use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the  Services, including your actions while using the Services, such as pages you  have visited, search queries you have run, advertisements you have seen, as  well as other anonymous, non-personally identifiable information. MPS may also  use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Services to personal  information obtained from you or a third party.<br>
</p>
<p>Third parties  that support the Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such  as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics,  may also use these technologies to collect similar information. MPS does not  control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy  policies of third parties using such technologies.<br>
</p>
