<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data through our site. "Personal data" includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes we make in the future will be posted on this page.</p>

<p>Personal data may be shared with third parties responsible for purging our mailing lists. In such cases, personal data will only be shared if that third party agrees to comply with procedures and policies which are compliant with our procedures and policies regarding data protection and if that third party has put in place adequate measures which are compliant with the applicable law.
