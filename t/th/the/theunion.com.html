<span class="heading">Partnership with You</span><br>
<span class="body2">Thank you for visiting our website, TheUnion.com. We think you'll find it very useful and hope you'll become a frequent participant in our on-line community. To enhance our partnership, from time to time, we may request personalized information from you; however, you will always have the opportunity to ignore the request; but, by doing so, you may miss opportunities to take advantage of the current and potential future offerings. <br><br>We respect your privacy and to help us earn your trust, we are sharing with you procedures that comprise our Privacy Policy. We rigorously adhere to them in all our business processes and each of our employees has individually been made aware of the Policy to help ensure that it becomes part of our company's culture. <br><br>The details of our Privacy Policy follow. If you have any questions or concerns about the information that helps to identify you that are not addressed below, contact us by: <br><br>E-Mail: <a href="mailto:webmaster@theunion.com">webmaster@theunion.com</a><br><br>The Union<br>464 Sutton Way<br>Grass Valley CA 95945<br><br>The Union reviews its Privacy Policy periodically and reserves the right to modify or remove portions of this Policy; however, we will honor the terms that were in effect when we gathered data from you. This web page will exhibit our current Policy and may be referenced to alert you of changes to past policy. <br><br>This Policy was last updated on August 15, 2003.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">Your Personal Information</span><br>
<span class="body2">We take your personal privacy seriously. We may request some personal information when you participate in user surveys, contests, subscriptions or other specific services offered on our site. We do this to help us respond to you, provide you with comprehensive services and offer you additional products. <br><br>We do not sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to non-affiliated parties. Furthermore, we will not disclose any personal information about you unless we have a good reason to believe that it is necessary to (1) comply with legal statutes, (2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of The Union or our individual or business partners. <br><br>Sometimes, we may provide aggregated statistics about you regarding sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any personal identifying information.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">Partnering with Our Affiliates</span><br>
<span class="body2">The Union encourages its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect your privacy. Be aware, however, that our business associates who are accessible through our site may have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should review the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personal information through co-branded, affiliated or linked sites. <br><br>In some cases, we may be providing a service or promotion to you in affiliation with another company. In some of those instances, we may be obliged to share your information with our partner company to facilitate the co-branded service or promotion.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">Modifying or Removing Your Information</span><br>
<span class="body2">We may use personal information to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences, our Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy and other services we offer. If you prefer that we do not use your contact information to communicate with you, you may decline during the registration process. You may also request that we remove your or your family's information from our files at any later time by sending an E-mail note to <a href="mailto:webmaster@theunion.com">webmaster@theunion.com</a> or sending a letter to The Union, 464 Sutton Way, Grass Valley, CA, 95945.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">Unauthorized Data Collection</span><br>
<span class="body2">You should also be aware that you may voluntarily or inadvertently disclose personal information (e.g. user name, email address or other identifiers) on message boards or in chat sessions. That information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from others. Such activities are beyond our control.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">How we use "cookies" and "beacons"</span><br>
<span class="body2">Cookies are widely used today and The Union incorporates them. Cookies enable a website to serve you more quickly and conveniently because they allow a website to recognize you as a former visitor. <br><br>Cookies are small packets of information that may be transferred from a website that you visit; your browser may optionally store the information on your computer's disk drive. Cookies generally include a unique number or login name to identify you that ties you to information disclosed to the website. The information in the cookie may be retrieved by a website when you subsequently visit that website. <br><br>Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some segments of our website will not be able to provide you with all available services if you disable cookies. <br><br>You also may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. We cannot control those cookies and they are outside the scope of this Policy. Please refer to the privacy policies of sites that you link to for additional information. <br><br>In some instances, our website may utilize a minute electronic image, called a beacon, to count visitors to a specific page or to access certain cookies. The Union may use beacons to conduct research or for auditing purposes.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">Access by Children</span><br>
<span class="body2">The Union is proud of its content, which does not offend people of any age. We encourage parents to help their children reap the benefits of the Internet. If parents have concerns regarding the suitability of our offerings or services, we'll be glad to address them on a one-on-one basis. You are welcome to drop by our office, telephone us or send us an e-mail to discuss our content. <br><br>As stated above, online visitors of any age may voluntarily or unwittingly divulge personal information that may result in disclosure of personal information or e-mail Ids. We do not knowingly send any direct e-mail offers to anyone if we learn that he/she is under the age of 13.</span><br><br>
<span class="heading">Security of Your Information</span><br>
<span class="body2">We use our best efforts to ensure the security of personal information submitted by you. When collecting credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-service transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart others from intercepting or misusing it. None of the personal and financial information that we collect is accessible by the public. Only a limited few of our employees have authorization to access the data that is secured by rigid procedures.</span><br><br>
