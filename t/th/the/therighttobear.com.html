<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br>
  Effective Date: January 2015</p>
<p> The following Privacy Policy governs the online information  collection practices of Therighttobear.com. ("we" or  "us"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we  gather about you while you are using www.Therighttobear.com or its subdomains  (collectively, the "Site") , and the ways in which we use this  information. If you do not agree with the policy herein, do not use the Site or  submit personal information to us. This Privacy Policy, including our  children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide  to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example,  at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).</p>
<p> Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using  the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is  governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may  need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case  we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the  Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing  to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy  as modified. It is, therefore, important that you review this Privacy Policy  regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>How We Collect and Use Information</strong></p>
<p> We may collect and store personal or other information that you  voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site  or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). This  site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the  event that they have opted to receive messages from us, signed up to receive  our free newsletters and/or information; replied to a survey, signed a digital  petition voted in an online poll; or, have purchased one of our products. This  site collects personally identifying information from our users during online  registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name  and e-mail address for registration to receive content from us or our affiliates  &nbsp;and name, postal address, and credit  card information when purchasing our products. All of this information is  provided to us by you. </p>
<p> We also collect and store information that is generated  automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may  collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which  allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you  and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in  browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with  the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard  drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the  Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users  visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having  to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have  entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons  (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to  access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted  email messages.</p>
<p> We use the information we collect from you while you are using the  Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize  features, and advertising that appear on the Site. We also may provide your  information (including personal information) to third parties, such as marketing  partners, service providers and contractors for a variety of purposes. Unless  you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the  right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information  collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any  purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information  about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for  these purposes, you must send a letter or email to the Online Privacy  Coordinator whose mailing address and email address are listed at the end of  this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that  may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.<br>
  Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your  personal information available for viewing by third parties online - for  example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas - that  information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be  responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.</p>
<p> Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and  present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via  cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and  ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their  advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness,  or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these  third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant  third-party's privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed,  the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be  different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of  cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that  party's website and review its privacy policy.</p>
<p> The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access  to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do  not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products  or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by  the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider  of such products or services.</p>
<p> We may also make some content, products and services available  through our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers,  where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with  such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner  any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting  any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In  some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in  which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the  provider partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider  partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy  policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner  directly for more information.</p>
<p> Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our  visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the  rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</p>
<p> In the event of a corporate merger, acquisition, sale of assets or  other related corporate transaction, we may transfer, assign and/or share your  personal and non-personal information with a transferee, assignee or acquirer  of the assets of the company. By using the Site, you acknowledge and consent  that such transfers could occur and are permitted, and that any transferee,  assignee or acquirer of our assets may continue to access, use, or process your  personal or non-personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <strong>Children's Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p><br>
  This children's privacy statement explains our practices with  respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children  under the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their  rights under federal law with respect to such information.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>This Site is       not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT knowingly       collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of       thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal       information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from       providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently       received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of       thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our       records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior,       verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable       information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. </li>
  <li>Because we do       not collect any personally identifiable information from children under       the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly       distribute such information to third parties. </li>
  <li>We do NOT       knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or       otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through       the Site. </li>
  <li>Because we do       not collect any personally identifiable information from children under       the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the       participation of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities on       providing personally identifiable information. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>How do we store your information?</strong></p>
<p>Your  information is stored at the list server that delivers our emails and data. We  have established certain reasonable electronic and administrative safeguards to  protect personally identifiable information in our possession from loss,  misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  Nevertheless, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global  communication vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during  transmission throughout the internet or while stored in our system or otherwise  in our care, will be absolutely safe from unauthorized intrusion by third  parties, such as hackers.</p>
<p>All  of the emails that are sent to you by us or our marketing partners include an  unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from our mailing  list by clicking on the unsubscribe link that can be found in every communication  that we send you.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>This  policy may be changed at any time at our discretion. If we should update this  policy, we will post the updates to this page on our Website.</p>
