                            Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a
                            Third-Party Service; "liking" or "sharing" SPE’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party

                            on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Service (i.e., "retargeting"). </p>

                        <p>SPE may use Service Providers for analytics services such as, without limitation, Google Analytics. These
                            analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help SPE analyze Service users and how
                            they use the Service. Information generated by these services (<em>e.g.</em>, your IP address and other
                            Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or

                            under this Privacy Policy (see <a href="#section1C">Section 1(c)</a>), data obtained by SPE from a third

                            of online activity or communications through our Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you
                            must discontinue your use of the Service.</p>

                            portions of the Service, however, may be intended as appropriate for a mixed audience of users under and

                            further information on how SPE treats Children’s Personal Information (defined below) in connection with any
                            children’s or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any), please see the Children’s Privacy Policy posted
                            thereon, which will be deemed incorporated herein for purposes of that part of the Service.</p>

                        <p>SPE does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act
                            ("<strong>COPPA</strong>") ("<strong>Children’s Personal Information</strong>") in a manner that is not
                            permitted by COPPA, and for any children’s or mixed-use portions of the Service (if any) SPE will comply
                            with COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and believe SPE has collected Children’s Personal Information in
                            a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external">here</a> and SPE will

                            posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting SPE <a href="https://secure.sonypictures.com/corp/contactus.html" rel="external">here</a>, detailing where
                            the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. SPE will then make reasonable good
                            faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be
                            individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure
                            complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by
