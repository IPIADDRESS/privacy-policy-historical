<h3>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS PRIVACY RIGHTS&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies that collect personally identifiable information ("PII") from California residents and disclose such information to Third Parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to which such information was provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with Third Parties. &nbsp;We have elected the second option and you may request that your PII not be shared with Third Parties by sending your request, including your full name, email address and postal address to: 5 Minute Monopoly Systems, 881 W. State Road, #140-455, Pleasant Grove, UT 84062. &nbsp;In accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1789.3, California resident users are entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone at 916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210; or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov.</p>
<h3>THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES OF 5MMS.</h3>
<h3>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Collection of Information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Survey Information.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5MMS collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, 5MMS or a Third Party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to 5MMS, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").&nbsp; 5MMS may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. &nbsp;Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to 5MMS or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from 5MMS or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to 5MMS.</p>
<h3>1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Site Membership or Registration.</h3>
<p>To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from 5MMS, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from 5MMS, whether at our Website, via email, on Third Party websites or otherwise. &nbsp;We collect information in certain portions of our Website, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). &nbsp;The personal profile information you submit to 5MMS remains your property, but by submitting that information to 5MMS, you grant 5MMS, the right to use that information for marketing purposes.&nbsp; 5MMS may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes. &nbsp;We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. &nbsp;These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. In addition, 5MMS reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event 5MMS believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if 5MMS is sold or acquired, or when 5MMS deems it necessary or appropriate. &nbsp;By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when 5MMS, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.</p>
<p>"Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for 5MMS’S services, either via registration at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing. 5MMS collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use, information provided by marketing partners, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number, activity, interests, user behavior and other demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services.</p>
<h3>1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Third Party List Information.</h3>
<p>5MMS collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and 5MMS subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). &nbsp;Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, 5MMS seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to 5MMS and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from Advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.</p>
<h3>1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other Information.</h3>
<p>Other occasions when 5MMS obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by 5MMS or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through 5MMS’S customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a 5MMS service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").</p>
<h3>1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</h3>
<p>5MMS currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, 5MMS may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
<h3>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cookies.</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows 5MMS to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in 5MMS’S database. &nbsp;You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. &nbsp;Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
<h3>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Web Beacons.</h3>
<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. &nbsp;This allows 5MMS to track certain websites an individual visits online. &nbsp;Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. &nbsp;For example, 5MMS might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. &nbsp;When Jane, an individual listed in 5MMS’S database, visits the cosmetic website, 5MMS receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and 5MMS would then update Jane’s profile with the information that Jane is interested in cosmetics.&nbsp; 5MMS may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. &nbsp;In addition to using web beacons on web pages, 5MMS also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in 5MMS’S database.</p>
<h3>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New Technology.</h3>
<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is 5MMS’S use of new and evolving technology. &nbsp;As a result, 5MMS strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
<h3>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usage Tracking.</h3>
<p>5MMS tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.</p>
<h3>(e) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Log Files.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>(f) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Optional Registration.</h3>
<p>5MMS may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. &nbsp;During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. &nbsp;This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services.</p>
<h3>(g) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Feedback and Inquiries.</h3>
<p>You have the ability to contact 5MMS to provide us with their feedback.&nbsp; 5MMS uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues.</p>
<h3>1.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside Information.</h3>
<p>5MMS may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of 5MMS including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").</p>
<h3>1.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Individual Information.</h3>
<p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information 5MMS gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
<h3>1.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No Information Collected from Children.</h3>
<p>5MMS will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. &nbsp;If 5MMS obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. &nbsp;Because it does not collect such information, 5MMS has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.&nbsp; 5MMS has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
<h3>1.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Credit Card Information.</h3>
<p>5MMS may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from 5MMS. &nbsp;When the Credit Card Information is submitted to 5MMS, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. 5MMS will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>
<h3>1.10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Links to External Websites.</h3>
<p>5MMS’S emails and websites may contain links to external websites. &nbsp;You will be taken to external websites if you click on these links. &nbsp;Your information may be passed from 5MMS’S database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website).&nbsp; 5MMS is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website owner. &nbsp;We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
<h3>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use of Individual Information.</h3>
<h3>2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discretion to Use Information.</h3>
<p>5MMS MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how 5MMS currently uses Individual Information, but 5MMS may change or broaden its use at any time. &nbsp;As noted below, 5MMS may update this policy from time to time. 5MMS may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.</p>
<h3>2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Email and Unsubscribe Policy.</h3>
<p>5MMS uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals.&nbsp; 5MMS may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. &nbsp;If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. &nbsp;To unsubscribe from all 5MMS’S email lists, a person must send an email to Support@5MinuteMogul.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>5MMS’S unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by 5MMS on its own behalf. &nbsp;You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.</p>
<p>You should also note that unsubscribing from 5MMS’S electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber’s information from any Third Party associates and licensees of the data. &nbsp;Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from 5MMS, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. &nbsp;This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p>
<h3>2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Content of Email Messages.</h3>
<p>In certain commercial email messages sent by 5MMS, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to 5MMS. &nbsp;The "Subject:" line of 5MMS email messages will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to 5MMS.</p>
<h3>2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Solicited Email.</h3>
<p>5MMS only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from 5MMS or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party websites to receive email from Third Parties such as 5MMS.&nbsp; 5MMS does not send unsolicited email messages. &nbsp;As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to 5MMS’S email messages.</p>
<h3>2.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Targeted Advertising.</h3>
<p>5MMS uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. &nbsp;When an individual is using the Internet, 5MMS uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.7 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and 5MMS attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. 5MMS may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>
<h3>2.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</h3>
<p>5MMS may use Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.</p>
<h3>2.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use of Technology Information.</h3>
<p>5MMS uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of 5MMS’S websites are most frequently visited. This information helps 5MMS to better understand the online habits of individuals so that 5MMS can target advertising and promotions to them.</p>
<h3>2.8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Profiles of Individuals.</h3>
<p>5MMS uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. &nbsp;A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.</p>
<h3>2.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Storage of Individual Information.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>5MMS stores the Individual Information in a database on its’ computers. &nbsp;Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under 5MMS’S control. &nbsp;Not withstanding such measures, 5MMS cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.</p>
<h3>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dissemination of Individual Information.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>3.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sale or Transfer to Third Parties.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>5MMS MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN 5MMS’S SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
<h3>3.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Order Fulfillment.</h3>
<p>5MMS will transfer Individual Information to Third Parties when necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders from such Third Party while using 5MMS’S websites or when responding to offers provided by 5MMS.</p>
<h3>3.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Legal Process.</h3>
<p>5MMS may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.</p>
<h3>3.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Summary Data.</h3>
<p>5MMS may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons.</p>
<h3>3.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Access.</h3>
<p>Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such information. Access can be obtained by contacting Support@5MinuteMogul.com .&nbsp; 5MMS may also grant advertising clients and email services providers’ access to an individual's email address to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.</p>
<h3>3.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do Not Call Registry Waiver. &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Even though you may be on a National or State DO NOT CALL list, by submitting your contact information which&nbsp;</p>
<p>may include your telephone number, you are expressly authorizing us and our advertising businesses and affiliates to contact you by telephone at the number you have used regarding the information you have expressed. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</h3>
<h3>4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</h3>
<p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals.&nbsp; 5MMS does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and 5MMS has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about individuals.</p>
<h3>4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Links.</h3>
<p>The Websites and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of Third Parties.&nbsp; 5MMS is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may contain links to websites maintained by Third Parties. &nbsp;Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. 5MMS does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products or services available on such Third Party websites. &nbsp;The inclusion of a link to a web site does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.</p>
<h3>4.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Affiliated Companies.</h3>
<p>5MMS may disclose, transfer, and sell Individual Information to entities affiliated with&nbsp; 5MMS in 5MMS’S discretion.</p>
<h3>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unsubscribe Procedures.</h3>
<p>If you wish to discontinue receiving email messages from 5MMS, you have several options:</p>
<h3>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unsubscribe from one email list.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>To unsubscribe from a particular list, either (1) send an email to Support@5MinuteMogul.com &nbsp;or (2) follow the instructions in each promotional email message sent by 5MMS.</p>
<h3>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unsubscribe from all of 5MMS’S email lists.&nbsp;</h3>
