You can visit most pages on our site (hereinafter defined) without giving us any information about yourself, but sometimes we need information to provide information or services that you request. This Privacy Policy explains data collection and use in those situations. By visiting our web site, you consent to the information practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>This Privacy Policy applies to our web site, which is located at the URL <a href="../">www.The3Day.org</a> (and each sub-domain associated with this URL) (collectively, the “Site”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites that may be accessible through the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of persons or entities that the Breast Cancer 3-Day does not control, manage or employ. The Site contains links to other sites that are operated by third parties, including, but not limited to, third party sites that may display the name, trademarks, service marks and logos of the Breast Cancer 3-Day.

<p><br><a name="1"></a><a name="privacy1"></a><strong>What type of information does the Breast Cancer 3-Day COLLECT and how is the information USED?<br></strong><br>While you are visiting the Site, the Breast Cancer 3-Day may collect two types of information about users: “Personal Information” (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone, credit card or debit card, personal preferences and other account-related information) and “Aggregate Information” (such as information about how many users log on to the Site on a daily basis). <br><br>Personal Information is collected online when you voluntarily submit non-public personal information on the Site by requesting information, purchasing our products, signing up for an account or other services, receiving electronic notices or other similar communications and other similar activities. <br><br>Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as pages most frequently accessed by you, time spent on a page or area of the Site, the number of visits to the Site by you, types of browser used by you, cookie preferences or search terms entered by you. <br><br>Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information (for example, the number of people who logged into the Site in a particular day). Aggregate Information does not personally identify a specific user. <br><br><em>Personal Information That You Provide to Us<br></em><br>We may obtain Personal Information about you ONLY if you elect to give us that information. Types of <br>Personal Information may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name </li><li>Address </li><li>Zip code </li><li>Telephone number </li><li>Occupation </li><li>Email address </li><li>Credit card number and expiration date (for online purchases or donations) </li><li>Name of organization (where applicable)</li><li>Breast cancer survivor or relationship to a breast cancer survivor</li></ul>
<p>We may request Personal Information, such as your user name or password, whenever you login to your account and may in limited circumstances ask you to provide credit card information and other personal information when making a donation online or registering for a Breast Cancer 3-Day. We reserve the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account. Generally, our uses of Personal Information collected online include, without limitation, responding to your inquiry about volunteering time to the Breast Cancer 3-Day, enabling you to make a donation, or providing information, such as sending marketing communications and newsletters. <br><br>The Breast Cancer 3-Day will retain your Personal Information for fulfillment of the intended purposes for which such Personal Information is collected. The Breast Cancer 3-Day will establish minimum and maximum retention periods based upon the type of information collected (i.e., sensitivity), the intended purposes and as otherwise may be legally required. <br><br>Personal Information shall NOT include any personal information posted or sent by or to you in any public forum (such as a message board) or any participant personal fundraising webpage on the Site. Participation in these public forums and the Breast Cancer 3-Day fundraising initiatives requires the public release and dissemination of such information, and thus the Breast Cancer 3-Day cannot commit to treating such information confidentially in the same manner that other personal information will be treated under this Privacy Policy. Participation in these programs is voluntary and thus your consent to certain terms is required before participation is allowed. <br><br><em>Aggregate Information Collected Automatically<br></em><br>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect Aggregate Information about your visit. We can tell the type of computer, browser, and web service that you are using. We also know the date, time, and pages that you visit. Collecting this information helps us design the Site to enhance your experience while on our Site. <br><br>The Breast Cancer 3-Day also may use Aggregate Information for internal purposes, such as tracking demographic data and providing targeted content to make the Site more useful to our visitors. The gathering of this Aggregate Information may be accomplished by the use of cookies or web beacons by the Breast Cancer 3-Day and its third party service providers. In particular, the Breast Cancer 3-Day will collect an IP Address from all visitors to the Site. An IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. The Breast Cancer 3-Day may share Aggregate Information with its content providers, sponsors, service providers or other third parties to advance the goals of research, education, dissemination of information and otherwise in fulfillment of the Breast Cancer 3-Day mission to raise funds for breast cancer research, education, and community health programs. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users’ movement on the Site, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Site, and deliver customized, personalized content. IP addresses, however, are not linked to Personal Information. The Breast Cancer 3-Day also may use an unique assigned number located with the Site’s URL to determine the web site from which you navigated to get to the Site. While this number may not be apparent to you, it does not contain your Personal Information.<br></p>
<p><a name="2"></a><a name="privacy2"></a><strong>Does the Breast Cancer 3-Day use COOKIES, OTHER TECHNOLOGIES or THIRD PARTIES to INDIRECTLY collect information on the Site?<br></strong><br>The Site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some web sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that site and are used for record-keeping purposes at many web sites. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular web site and to make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly.
