			<h1>The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Privacy Policy<br>
<span class="Small">Revised May 22, 2003</span></h1>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS values the privacy of its members, affiliates, and visitors to its Web sites and is strongly committed to each visitor's right to privacy. This Privacy Policy has been developed as a codification of The IIA's commitment in this area.</p>

<p>The Privacy Policy explains The IIA's information gathering and handling practices. If you have any questions regarding The IIA's Privacy Policy or do not feel that your concerns have been otherwise addressed, please contact the Chief Privacy Officer by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@theiia.org">privacy@theiia.org</a>.</p>

<h4>CONSENT</h4>

<p>By using The IIA's Web sites you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy. If you, as a visitor, choose online to log on as a member, register for courses or events, purchase products, apply for membership or certification, or otherwise submit personally identifiable information, you are consenting to The IIA's use of such data in accordance with its Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>SCOPE</h4>

<p>It is the intent of The IIA to be in compliance with the principles of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of Canada, the European Union Safe Harbour Act, the Data Protection Act of the United Kingdom, and selected legislation worldwide regarding privacy of data.</p>

<p>This Policy guides how The IIA stores and uses personal information that is collected by The IIA or provided to The IIA, whether through our Web sites or by other methods such as an application, enrollment, registration or order form, or other means. This Policy covers all of The IIA's Web sites. However, this Policy does not cover affiliate Web sites whether or not linked to The IIA's sites.</p>

<h4>WEB SITE USER ID AND PASSWORD</h4>

<p>If you are a member of The IIA in the United States, Canada, or the Caribbean, a new member of a regular or charter option chapter outside this area, or an international member at large, you will receive a membership number and password directly from The IIA along with your other membership information. This number and password will serve as the only means of authenticating your identity to The IIA's Web sites. If you are a member of an institute, charter option chapter, or chapter in formation outside the United States, Canada, or the Caribbean, The IIA will transmit your membership number and password to your affiliate, which bears the responsibility of providing this information to you so that you can access members-only and other secured pages of The IIA's Web sites.</p>

<h4>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</h4>

<p>Even if you do nothing during your visit other than navigate an IIA Web site, read pages, or download information, we will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit. In order to ensure that our Web sites are as useful and effective an information source as they can be, we analyze information that identifies visitors by categories such as the location of visitors (by domain, not by personal e-mail address) and browser types. We also measure, in the aggregate, indicators such as numbers of visits, average time spent on the sites, and pages viewed. The IIA uses these statistics to improve site content and usability; this information does not identify visitors personally.</p>

<p>However, when a visitor enters a membership number and password obtained by the means described above on an IIA Web site for the purpose of logging in to restricted pages, a "temporary cookie" is deployed. This cookie – a small text file stored temporarily on the visitor's browser – enables the Web site to "remember" this authentication information during movement from one page to another. This makes it unnecessary to log in again on each page. The cookie will expire when the visitor leaves and no personal data is retained. In addition, to help prevent unauthorized users from using your identifying information, the cookie will expire if your session is idle for approximately 20 minutes. If you have set your Internet browser to reject cookies, access may be denied to secured areas of The IIA's Web sites.</p>

<p>With the exception of specific secured pages, visitors are not required to be IIA members in order to gain access to The IIA's Web sites, although nonmembers may be required to register in order to receive all benefits available to users of the sites</p>

<p>The IIA may use personally identifiable information you have voluntarily provided on our Web sites or by other means to notify you via e-mail or printed material of IIA events or other relevant products and services offered by The IIA. If you are a member of an IIA specialty section, The IIA may produce a directory of such participants for networking purposes. If you do not want to receive notice of such events or be included in specialty directories, you may choose to opt out by the means detailed in the Opting Out section of this policy.</p>

<h4>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA FROM IIA AFFILIATES</h4>

<p>The IIA collects limited personal data from IIA affiliates worldwide in order to provide limited membership services to individuals who belong jointly to these affiliates and to the IIA. Transfer and update of data between IIA and its affiliates is allowed through an explicit consent of its members, or through adherence of IIA affiliates to the Safe Harbour Act in Europe, Data Protection Act in the UK, or other privacy policies worldwide. Members of IIA affiliates who do not wish transfer of their personal data should request exclusion through their affiliate or through the Opting Out section of this policy.</p>

<h4>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h4>

<p>If you voluntarily provide The IIA with personally identifiable information, The IIA may also release that information on a selective basis to outside organizations whose products and services are of perceived benefit. These organizations include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>For purchase of educational products, PBD Inc., which is The IIA's distribution/fulfillment house in Alpharetta, Ga.</li>

<li>Various companies that authenticate credit cards on behalf of The IIA if you provide a credit card for the purchase of products or services.</li>

<li>If you register as a certification candidate, to the examination site. Registrant's information may also be released to providers of CIA exam preparation products, who subsequently may send you information concerning their products and services.</li>

<li>IIA affiliates, which may solicit you for local participation or membership. In the case of IIA members, the affiliate may publish your name in a directory or use your data to mail or e-mail affiliate materials, unless you contact the affiliate and opt out of such disclosure.</li>

<li>For some North American members, The IIA may provide mailing information to other organizations whose products and services are of perceived benefit. If you do not want The IIA to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties other than IIA affiliates or as noted above, please see Opting Out section of this policy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>RIGHT OF ACCESS</h4>

<p>The IIA is dedicated to providing reasonable access to members and others who want to review their personal information maintained by The IIA and correct any inaccuracies therein. Members may view and update their data by accessing the Member Profile, available upon logging in to <a href="http://www.theiia.org/profile" target="_blank">www.theiia.org/profile</a>. Nonmembers may verify and/or change their data by e-mailing <a href="mailto:custserv@theiia.org">custserv@theiia.org</a> or by writing Customer Service, The IIA, 247 Maitland Ave., Altamonte Springs, Fla. 32701, USA. The IIA, however, is not responsible for verifying the continued accuracy of either member or nonmember information.</p>

<h4>SECURITY</h4>

<p>Although The IIA does not monitor the Web site, The IIA has reasonable policies in place to protect from misuse the personally identifiable information provided by its users.</p>

<h4>LINKS</h4>

<p>The IIA's Web sites contain "links" to other sites, including sites operated by IIA affiliates or their agents. The IIA does not control, and is not responsible for, the accuracy, timeliness, security, or even the continued availability or existence of this outside information. Opinions expressed on other sites linked from The IIA's Web sites are not necessarily those of The IIA, nor does The IIA endorse, warrant, or guarantee products or services described or offered on those other sites. Neither is The IIA responsible for the contents of any Web sites that choose to link to The IIA's Web sites with or without The IIA's consent.</p>

<p>Other organizations linked to The IIA's Web sites may collect information about you when you view or click on these sites. The IIA cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these organizations directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.</p>

<h4>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

<p>The IIA reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. Nothing contained herein is intended to create a contract or agreement between The IIA and any other party.The users of The IIA's Web sites should reference this policy periodically to ensure that they have knowledge of the current provisions of The IIA's Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4>OPTING OUT OF THE RELEASE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

<p>IIA members may choose to be excluded from certain mailings or other uses of their personally identifiable information by The IIA.To opt out, please complete the appropriate mailing and e-mail option fields on the Member Profile form on The IIA's Web site, or send your request via e-mail to: <a href="mailto:privacy@theiia.org">privacy@theiia.org</a>.</p>

<p>However, if you choose to provide The IIA with personally identifiable information by purchasing a product, registering for an event, or requesting other services, The IIA may use that information to provide you with the purchased products or services, for billing purposes, to send immediately relevant information to you, to respond to you, and for other purposes related to the reason you provided the information even if you opt out of the use of your information by the means detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
