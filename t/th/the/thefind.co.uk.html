They may also place their own Cookies or Web Beacons on your computer to help those ads and other content to run, analyze site usage and to provide you with personalized on-line advertisements. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed. How they use Cookies and Web Beacons is described below.</p><p>

<h2>Who do We Share Your Information With?</h2><p>
We may share your information, including your personal information, with third parties who provide services to our sites' visitors and to us. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees, consultants, ad servers and content servers, email service providers and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to us or to you.</p><p>
We may share aggregated information concerning our users and their use of the sites to other merchants and advertising companies.</p><p>
We may disclose data about you to the government if we are required to do so or if we think the disclosure is appropriate; and you authorize these disclosures. We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential lawsuits (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures may potentially mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights.</p><p>
We may disclose personally identifiable information about you to companies whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy such as other marketers, publishers, retailers, and other organizations that want to directly market products or services to you.</p><p>

<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2><p>
When you visit the sites, we along with our ad servers, content servers, and web site analysis agents will place small text files called "cookies" on your computer hard drive that we can retrieve when you visit the sites again to make your visit more relevant and to retrieve information from prior visits. The cookies store information about the searches you have made, the items you have viewed, the favorites you have saved, your user name and other information. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your search preferences and notification preferences whenever you visit our sites. When we send you promotional emails through our email services providers, they may also place a cookie on your computer. You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser, but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you in an effective manner. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you.</p><p>
A Web Beacon or action tag (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by users who view certain advertisements or other information on our sites. Web Beacon are generally 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. Our ad servers, content servers, website analysis agents and email service providers may use Web Beacons in our sites and advertisements to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular advertisement or visit the pages of our sites and to provide information about what products are viewed or searched for or other similar actions taken. Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers across the internet) which ads are the most effective on particular sites or emails. They also use the information for the purpose of targeting future campaigns across the internet and to you and for upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our ad servers, content servers, and web site analysis agents, and third-party e-mail distributors note some of the pages you visit on our sites through the use of Web Beacons.</p>
<h2>Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</h2><p>
You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our emails or promotional materials by following any unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement you receive from us. If you open a new account or otherwise subsequently sign up to receive marketing materials, your opt-out will end unless you opt-out again by following the opt-out instructions in the promotional materials.</p>
<h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2><p>
The sites include links to other web sites or resources ("External Web Sites").

TheFind.com has no control over External Web Sites and they will independently collect and maintain information about you according to their own policies and practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those External Web Sites. If you have concerns about how other web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy and contact them.</p>
