<p><b>Combined Information</b>. For the purposes discussed in this Privacy Policy, we may combine the information that we collect through the Services with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Information utilised and/or collected above may be classified as “personal data” (as defined by Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act) and shall be governed by the applicable regulation accordingly.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. <u>COOKIES AND ONLINE ANALYTICS</u></b></p>
<p>We use a variety of online tracking and analytics tools (e.g., cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, and HTML5) to collect and analyse information as you use the Services. Among other things, these technologies allow us to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing and usage preferences.</p>
<p>We may also use third-party web analytics services on our Services to collect and analyse information collected through these technologies to assist us in auditing, research, or reporting; fraud prevention; and providing certain features to you. The types of tracking and analytics tools we and our service providers use for these purposes are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><b>“Cookies” </b>are small data files stored on your computer or device to collect information about your use of the Services. Cookies may enable us to recognise you as the same user who used our Services in the past, and relate your use of the Services to other information we have about you. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Services (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of our Services or features. Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.</li>

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><b>“Local shared objects,” </b>or <b>“flash cookies,” </b>may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software. Local shared objects operate much like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings.</li>

<li>A <b>“pixel tag” </b>(also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our web pages.</li>

<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. <u>ONLINE ADVERTISING</u></b></p>
<p><b> A. Online Advertising Overview</b></p>
<p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/%23!/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/%23!/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or Y<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">our Online Choices</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customise Google display network ads, visit the G<a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">oogle Ads Settings page</a>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
<p><b> B. Mobile Advertising</b></p>
<p>When using mobile applications from TM or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalised in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.</p>
<p>You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>
<p><b> C. Notice Concerning Do Not Track.</b></p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for online advertising and analytics purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognise or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about<a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Do Not Track</a>.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. <u>NOTICE ABOUT THE USE OF OUR FORUMS AND FEATURES</u></b></p>
<p>Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly and privately with other users, such as through our public forums, chat rooms, blogs, personal messages, review features, and message boards. You should be aware that any information you provide or post in these ways may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. While we do not have an obligation to monitor the content of messages sent using our Services, we reserve the right to, in our discretion. We encourage you to be cautious about the information you submit (e.g., choose a username that does not disclose your personal identity). Whenever you post something in our Services, social media and any other third party platforms we control, it may be impossible to remove all instances of the posted information, for example, if someone has taken a screenshot of your posting. You may be required to register with a third-party application to post a comment. Moreover, please note that if you participate in one of our registry programs, in some instances, you can choose to make your registries available only to guests and friends via a password. If you do not elect this option, then any user will be able to search for and view your registry by using your first and/or last name and other information regarding your event.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. <u>AGGREGATE AND DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION</u></b></p>
<p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify any information collected through the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors, in our discretion.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. <u>YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS</u></b></p>
<p>You have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this Section, in addition to any rights discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>Marketing Communications. </b>You may instruct us not to use your information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p>
<p><b>Consumer Privacy Rights. </b>Depending on the laws of your local jurisdiction, you may have certain rights and choices with respect to your information. For example, under local laws, you may be able to ask us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide access to certain information we hold about you</li>
<li>Update or correct your information</li>
<li>Delete certain information</li>
<li>Restrict the use of your information</li>

<p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We will let you know where this is the case or if certain rights don’t apply in your country or state of residence. We may request you to provide us with information necessary to verify your identity before responding to your request as required or permitted by applicable law.</p>

Requests for removal of a user testimonial can be done by contacting us as detailed in the “TM Contact Information” section below.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8. <u> THIRD PARTY LINKS AND FEATURES</u></b></p>
<p>The Services may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements (e.g., a “Share It!” or “Like” button) that lead to other websites, apps, or services not subject to this Privacy Policy (including other sites that may be co-branded with our brands). On some of our Services, you may also be able to register with or purchase directly from third-party retailers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other websites to which the Services link or which link to our Services. The privacy policies of these other sites will govern the collection and use of your information thereon, and we encourage you to read each such policy to learn about how your information may be treated by others.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9. <u>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</u></b></p>
<p>The Services are intended for general audiences and not for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected “personal data” (as defined by Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act) from children under the age of 13 without legally-valid parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10. <u>INTERNATIONAL USERS</u></b></p>
<p>Our Services are targeted to individuals located in countries including but not limited to Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, India, Japan, Australia, Nigeria as well as Kenya. Please note that in providing services to you, your information will be transferred to Singapore. Moreover, TM may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with other members within the TM group, trusted service providers, and trusted business partners located in countries other than your country of residence, in accordance with applicable law. Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.</p>
<p>If you live in the EEA, please note that if we provide any information about you to any non-EEA members of our group or third-party information processors, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures include signing Standard Contractual Clauses in accordance with EU and other data protection laws to govern the transfers of such data. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact us as detailed in the “TM Contact Information” section below.</p>
<p>If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;11. <u>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</u></b></p>
<p>We take a variety of physical, technical, administrative, and organisational security measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to, through, or on our Services or via the Internet and that any such transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p>When you sign up for an account, you may be required to establish a username and password. If you create an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your account. We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your password.</p>
<p>If you use messaging or call features that allow you to interact with events vendors and others directly through our Services, please note that for security purposes, you should not include any passwords, social security numbers, payment card information, or other sensitive information in such communications.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12. <u>RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</u></b></p>
<p>We store and maintain your information for the purposes for which it is processed by us. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13. <u>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</u></b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the Policy periodically.
