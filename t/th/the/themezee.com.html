As such, customized, interest-targeted commercials adapted for display on a terminal device (e.g. cell phone) in accordance with your previous usage and browsing behaviour can be also displayed on another of your terminal devices (e.g. PC, tablet).</p><p>If you have given the appropriate permission, Google will link your web and app browser history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same customized commercials will be displayed on any terminal device on which you are logged in to your Google account.</p><p>In order to support this function, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users, which are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics Data, to identify and to compile target groups for cross-device advertising.</p><p>You can permanently object to cross-device remarketing/targeting by deactivating customised commercials in your Google account by using the link below: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a></p><p>You will find further information and data protection regulations in Google’s Privacy Policy under: <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a></p><h2>Google AdWords and Google conversion tracking</h2><p>This site uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).</p><p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click an ad delivered by Google, a cookie for conversion tracking is stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache of the user’s browser. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p><p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an Adwords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the Adwords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. The Adwords advertisers can find out the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and were directed to the page with a conversion tracking tag. The advertisers do not, however, obtain any information that can be used to identify users personally. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can refuse by simply deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie via your internet browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p><p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google conversion tracking, please see Google’s privacy policy at: <a href="http://www.google.de/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a></p><p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. The disabling of cookies may limit your ability to use some of the functions of this website.</p><h2>Registration with this websites</h2><p>You can register with this website to be able to use additional functions on this website.
