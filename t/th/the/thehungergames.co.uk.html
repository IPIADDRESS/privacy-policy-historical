	<h3>2. <span class="caps">DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></h3>


	<p>2.1    Subject to clauses 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, we do not share, sell, rent or distribute personal data to or with third parties unless the transfer of such information to third parties is strictly necessary for the performance of the Purposes (e.g. for fulfilling your order for a magazine subscription) and will not disclose personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have consented to this.</p>


	<p>2.2    We may share personal information with other companies within the Scholastic Group of companies which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985 We may disclose personal information to service providers who manage aspects of our operations. We may also disclose personal information to third parties when we consider it necessary for the purpose of maintaining the safety and security of the Website.</p>


	<p>2.3    In the future, we may sell our business or assets. Personal information is usually considered an asset in such transactions.

	<p>2.4    We may share your personal information with other companies where you have expressly consented to this.</p>

This includes exchanging information with our companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>


	<h3>3. <span class="caps">COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES</span></h3>


	<p>3.1 In addition to asking you to submit personal information, we may collect information about you automatically when you visit the Website. This information is not normally personally identifiable. Such information includes general information about your computer settings, your connection to the internet (i.e. your Internet Service Provider), your IP address (this is the number assigned to your computer by a web server when you are on the internet), your geographical location, your operating system, your browsing patterns, the pages you visit and documents downloaded. We analyse such information in the aggregate and will not use it for the purpose of identifying you (except that we may use such information to identify a visitor if we consider that there are or may be safety or security issues or to comply with relevant laws and regulations).</p>


	<p>3.2 We may collect this information through the use of software technology called “cookies”. Cookies are small bits of information which are sent to your computer’s hard drive when you first visit the Website, and which allow us to identify your computer (but not you) the next time you visit the Website. We may use the information collected in this way to (i) identify what technologies and internet services are being used by our visitors and (ii) track usage of the Website so that we can adapt the Website to ensure that it better suits your needs and interests.</p>


	<p>3.3 Most internet browsers give you the option to reject all cookies, accept all cookies, erase cookies stored on your computer or be notified before a cookie is stored on your computer.

However, no data transmission over the internet can ever be entirely secure. While we will always use reasonable endeavours to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information submitted via the Website and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>


	<p>4.2 We use secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line to protect your credit card information. It encrypts all of your personal and credit card information so that it cannot be read as it progresses through our ordering system. Once this information is received, it is stored in a location isolated  from the internet.</p>


	<p>4.3 We do not require you to register in order to access the Website. However, certain parts of this Website are secure and only available once you have registered and chosen a unique password. You will be responsible for all use, access and communications to this Website utilising such password whether or not such use, access or communications are authorised by you. As a result, please keep your password safe.</p>


	<h3>5. <span class="caps">MONITORING EMAILS</span></h3>


	<p>We may monitor and/or keep records of email communications which you send us in the interests of our business and in accordance with this policy.</p>


	<h3>6. <span class="caps">LINKS TO OTHER SITES</span></h3>


	<p>Visitors will find links from the Website to third party sites that are not operated by us including links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. Where we provide such links, we do so for information purposes only. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the practices or content of such other sites which will/should have their own privacy policies.  We do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.  We recommend that children check with their parents before clicking through to any third party sites, and we encourage all users of this Website to read the privacy policies of all linked sites before navigating through them and submitting any personal data.</p>

We will inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at enquiries@scholastic.co.uk.</p>
