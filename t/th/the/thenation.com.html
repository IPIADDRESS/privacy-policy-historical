firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for www.thenation.com: 
</p>

<h3>
Scope
</h3>

<p>
This document addresses the privacy policy of thenation.com and does not
necessarily reflect the privacy policy of <i>The Nation</i> Magazine, The
Nation Associates, The Nation Institute, or any other affiliated
organization or individual. 
</p>

<p>
This statement is subject to change or alteration at any time, and use
of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in
effect at the time of use. Notices of such changes will be posted on
this web page.  You should check our website frequently to see recent
changes.
</p>

<h3>
Information Gathering 
</h3>

<p>
	<b>General Information:</b> If you subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
make use of our products and services, we may collect personal
information from you, including your name, age, address, e-mail address,
credit card number and facts about your computers, profession and
similar information.  We do not, however, knowingly collect personal
information from children under the age of thirteen.
</p>

<p>
	<b>IP addresses:</b>  We use your IP address (the location of your computer
on the internet) to help diagnose problems with our server, to
administer our Web site, to gauge the popularity of content areas, and
to gather broad demographic information for prospective advertisers.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Cookies:</b>  Although we do not currently do so, we reserve the right
to use "cookies" to authenticate registered users and subscribers, and
to target advertising based on broad demographic categories. 
</p>

<h3>
Information Use and Sharing 
</h3>

<p>
	We may use information in the following ways: 
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
	For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information
including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify
subscriptions. 
</p>

<p>
	To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products
and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. 
</p>

<p>
	To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and
services. 
</p>

<p>
	To provide aggregate information ­ not individual data ­ to our
advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor
the reach of their advertising on the service.
</p>

<p>
	To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and
others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. 
</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>

<b>Email Addresses:</b> We will not share your e-mail address with third

<b>Agents:</b>  We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
on our behalf.  Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  They
have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,
but are contractually prohibited from using it for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</b> We work closely with our
affiliated businesses, an example of which is [Amazon.com].  In some
cases, these businesses offer products to you at thenation.com.  In
other cases, we sell product lines jointly with these businesses.  You
can tell when another business is involved in your transactions, and we
share customer information related to those transactions with that
business.  We encourage our affiliated businesses to adopt privacy policies
which are substantially similar to our own.  
</p>
