Privacy Statement for TheNation.com


</p><p style="font-family: monospace">January 10, 2006</p>

<p>
The Nation Company, L.P. has created this statement to demonstrate our
firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for www.thenation.com:
</p>

<h2 class="subhed">
Scope
</h2>

<p>
The following privacy policy governs our online collection of
information from you. This privacy policy, including our children's
privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to
us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means; for
example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail. We may
collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you
voluntarily supply to us online as part of the Service. We also collect
and store information that is generated automatically as users navigate
online through the Service.
</p>

<p>
This document addresses the privacy policy of TheNation.com and does not
necessarily reflect the privacy policy of <i>The Nation</i> Magazine, The
Nation Associates, The Nation Institute, or any other affiliated
organization or individual.
</p>

<p>
This statement is subject to change or alteration at any time, and use
of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in
effect at the time of use. Notices of such changes will be posted on
this web page. You should check our website frequently to see recent
changes.
</p>

<h2 class="subhed">
Information Gathering
</h2>

<p>
<i>General Information:</i> If you subscribe for, purchase or otherwise make
use of our products and services, we may collect personal information
from you, including your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit card
number and facts about your computers, profession and similar
information. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information
from children under the age of thirteen.
</p>

<p>
<i>IP Addresses:</i> We use your IP address (the location of your computer on
the internet) to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer
our Web site, to gauge the popularity of content areas, and to gather
broad demographic information for prospective advertisers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cookies:</i> We use "cookies" to help deliver
advertisements and to identify unique browsers that visit us and to
track usage throughout our site. Some of our business affiliates and
advertisers use cookies, which can be used to tell when your computer
has contacted a web site. Because we do not control the privacy policies
of our business affiliates, advertisers or any other sites to which we
may provide hyperlinks, you should check the privacy policy of the site
you are visiting if you have any concerns about that site's use of
cookies or about that site's use of your information.
</p>

<h2 class="subhed">
Information Use and Sharing
</h2>

<p>
We may use information in the following ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information
including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify
subscriptions.
</li>

<li>
To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and
services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.
</li>

<li>
To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and
services.
</li>

<li>
To provide aggregate information--not personally identifiable
information--to our advertisers to help them better understand our
services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the
service. 
</li>

<li>
To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and
others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors
when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="terms_of_service.mhtml">Terms of Service</a> agreement, or to
protect the rights, property or safety of users of our Services, the
public, or The Nation. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Email Addresses:</i> We will not share your e-mail address with third
parties, although we reserve the right to present you with
advertisements on their behalf.
</p>

<p>
<i>Subscription Lists:</i> In accordance with standard industry practice, The
Nation may rent, exchange or sell to third parties information you
provide us when ordering a subscription to our print publication. We
adhere strictly to the Direct Marketing Association's Ethical Business
Practices For information about this practice, visit the Direct
Marketing Association's website at <a href="http://www.the-dma.org/consumers/privacy.html">http://www.the-
dma.org/consumers/privacy.html</a>. </p>

<p>
If you wish not to receive unsolicited offers by mail, we strongly
encourage you to take part in the Direct Marketing Association's Mail
Preference Service.
</p>

<p>
<i>Agents:</i> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They
have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,
but are contractually prohibited from using it for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Third Party Providers:</i> We also make some content, products and services
available through our Service through cooperative relationships with
third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear
prominently on the Service. We may share with our provider partner any
information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting
any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider
partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information
from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider
partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information. The
privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you
have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider
partners, you should contact the provider directly for more information.
</p>

<p>
<i>Major Business Transactions:</i> In the event of a major business
transaction, our customer information may be one of the transferred
business assets.

practices or the content of such Web sites.
</p>

<p>
Our site uses an order form for customers to subscribe to our print
publication, <i>The Nation</i>. We collect visitor's contact information (like
their postal and e-mail addresses). Contact information from the order
form is used to send orders to our customers, or to send e-mail

Children's Privacy Statement
</h2>

<p>
TheNation.com is directed to teenagers and adults and is not directed to
children under the age of 13. This children's privacy statement explains
our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal
information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides
important information on your rights under federal law with respect to
such information.
</p>

<p>
We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service. We screen
users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users
under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become
aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable
information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the
Service, we will delete such information from our records. If we change
our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental
consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from
children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service.
</p>

<p>
Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from
children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service, we also do
NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
</p>

<p>
We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly
post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information
through the Service.
</p>

<p>
Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from
children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service, we do NOT
condition the participation in the Service's online activities of a
child under thirteen on providing personally identifiable information.
</p>
