Privacy Statement for TheNation.com
</h1>


<p style="font-family: monospace">
August 22, 2007
</p>

<p>
The Nation Company, L.P. and its affiliated organizations and individuals (which also may be collectively referred to herein as, among other things, "we," "us" and "our") have created this statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our websites.
</p>

<h2>
Scope 
</h2>
<p>
The following privacy policy governs our online collection of information from you. This privacy policy, including our children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means; for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail. We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us online as part of your use of our sites (the "Services").  We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as users navigate online through the Services. 
</p>

<p>
This document addresses the privacy policy of TheNation.com and other sites owned and operated by The Nation Company or its affiliates (unless otherwise indicated by such site) including, but not limited to TheNationMart.com.  Each site of the Services may further supplement, revise or otherwise amend this privacy policy as it relates to such site. 
</p>

<p>
This statement is subject to change or alteration at any time, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time of our use. Notices of such changes will be posted on this web page. You should check our sites frequently to see recent changes. 
</p>

<h2>
Information Gathering
</h2> 
<p>
General Information: If you subscribe for, purchase or otherwise make use of our products and services, we may collect personal information from you, including your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit card number and facts about your computers, profession and similar information. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. 
</p>

<p>
<i>IP Addresses:</i> We may use your IP address (the location of your computer on the internet) to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our sites, to gauge the popularity of content areas, and to gather broad demographic information for prospective advertisers. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Cookies: </i> We use "cookies" to help deliver advertisements and to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our sites. Some third party merchants and advertisers use cookies, which can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a site.  Because we do not control the privacy policies of third party merchants, advertisers or any other sites to which we may provide hyperlinks, you should check the privacy policy of the site you are visiting if you have any concerns about that site's use of cookies or about that site's use of your information. 
</p>

<h2>
Information Use and Sharing
</h2> 
<p>
We may use information in the following ways: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions.
</li>
<li>
To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers (as well as such products, services and offers offered by The Nation Institute), or to otherwise contact you. 
</li>
<li>
To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. 
</li>
<li>
To provide aggregate information--not personally identifiable information--to our advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the Services. 
</li>
<li>
To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of our Services, the public, or The Nation Company or its affiliates. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Email Addresses:</i> We will not share your e-mail address with third parties, although we reserve the right to present you with advertisements on their behalf.
</p>

<p>
<i>Subscription Lists:</i> In accordance with standard industry practice, we may rent, exchange or sell to third parties mailing address information you provide us when ordering a subscription to our print publication, <cite>The Nation</cite>.  We adhere strictly to the Direct Marketing Association's Ethical Business Practices For information about this practice, visit the Direct Marketing Association's site at http://www.the- dma.org/consumers/privacy.html. 
</p>

<p>
If you wish not to receive unsolicited offers by mail, we strongly encourage you to take part in the Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Agents:</i> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are contractually prohibited from using it for other purposes. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Third Party Providers:</i> We also make some content, products and services available through our Services through cooperative relationships with third parties, where the brands of such third party appear prominently on the Services.  We may share with such third party any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with such third party.  In some cases, the third party may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of such third party may apply to its use of your information. The privacy policy of third parties may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of a third party, you should contact the third party directly for more information. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Major Business Transactions:</i> In the event of a major business transaction, our customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. 
</p>

<h2>
Links 
</h2>

<p>
Our sites may contain links to other sites, in the form of hyperlinks and banner advertisements. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. 
</p>

<p>
Our sites may use an order form for customers to subscribe to a publication or other services or to purchase certain items. We may collect visitor's contact information (like their postal and e-mail addresses). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers, or to send e-mail newsletters that they have requested. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out section below. 
</p>

<h2>
Public Forums 
</h2>

<p>
Our sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to their users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and that information can be collected and used by others besides The Nation Company and its affiliates. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose online. 
</p>

<h2>
Security 
</h2>

<p>
Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 
</p>

<h2>
Children's Privacy Statement 
</h2>
<p>
Our sites are directed to teenagers and adults and are not directed to children under the age of 13. This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information on your rights under federal law with respect to such information. 
</p>

<p>
We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Services.  We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Services, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Services. 
</p>

<p>
Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Services, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties. 
</p>

<p>
We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the Services. 
</p>

<p>
Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Services, we do NOT condition the participation in the Services' online activities of a child under thirteen on providing personally identifiable information. 
</p>
