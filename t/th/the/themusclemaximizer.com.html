 <h1>Privacy <em id="blue">Policy</em></h1>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer and all its related web sites (The Muscle Maximizer) Privacy Policy
                    PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. The Muscle Maximizer DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.</p>
                    <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO The Muscle Maximizer OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
                    <p>The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of The Muscle Maximizer
                    This policy applies to The Muscle Maximizer's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by The Muscle Maximizer on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to The Muscle Maximizer's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. The Muscle Maximizer is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.</p>

                    <h2>1. Collection of Information.</h2>
                    <h3>1.1 Survey Information.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a The Muscle Maximizer survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, The Muscle Maximizer or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to The Muscle Maximizer , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). The Muscle Maximizer may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to The Muscle Maximizer or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from The Muscle Maximizer or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to The Muscle Maximizer.</p>
                    <h3>1.2 Third Party List Information.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and The Muscle Maximizer subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, credit card information, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, The Muscle Maximizer seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to The Muscle Maximizer and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.</p>
                    <h3>1.3 Other Information.</h3>

                    <p>Other occasions when The Muscle Maximizer obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by The Muscle Maximizer or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through The Muscle Maximizer's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a The Muscle Maximizer service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").</p>
                    <h3>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The Muscle Maximizer may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
                    <h3>(a) Cookies.</h3>
                    <p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The Muscle Maximizer to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in The Muscle Maximizer's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
                    <h3>(b) Web Beacons.</h3>

                    <p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The Muscle Maximizer to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The Muscle Maximizer might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in The Muscle Maximizer's database, visits the fishing website, The Muscle Maximizer receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and The Muscle Maximizer would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. The Muscle Maximizer may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, The Muscle Maximizer also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The Muscle Maximizer's database.</p>
                    <h3>(c) New Technology.</h3>
                    <p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The Muscle Maximizer's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The Muscle Maximizer strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
                    <h3>1.5 Outside Information.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of The Muscle Maximizer including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").</p>
                    <h3>1.6 Individual Information.</h3>

                    <p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information The Muscle Maximizer gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
                    <h3>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If The Muscle Maximizer obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, The Muscle Maximizer has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The Muscle Maximizer has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
                    <h3>1.8 Credit Card Information.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from The Muscle Maximizer. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to The Muscle Maximizer, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. The Muscle Maximizer will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>
                    <h2>2. Use of Individual Information.</h2>

                    <h3>2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</h3>
                    <p>THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.
                    The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how The Muscle Maximizer currently uses Individual Information, but The Muscle Maximizer may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, The Muscle Maximizer may update this policy from time to time. The Muscle Maximizer may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.</p>
                    <h3>2.2 Email.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. The Muscle Maximizer may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.</p>
                    <h3>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</h3>
                    <p>In certain commercial email messages sent by The Muscle Maximizer, an advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to The Muscle Maximizer. The "Subject:" line of The Muscle Maximizer email messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser to The Muscle Maximizer.</p>

                    <h3>2.2(b) Solicited Email.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from The Muscle Maximizer or to individuals who have agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such as The Muscle Maximizer. The Muscle Maximizer does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to The Muscle Maximizer's email messages.</p>
                    <h3>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet, The Muscle Maximizer uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and The Muscle Maximizer attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. The Muscle Maximizer may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>
                    <h3>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.</p>

                    <h3>2.5 Use of Technology Information.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of The Muscle Maximizer's web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps The Muscle Maximizer to better understand the online habits of individuals so that The Muscle Maximizer can target advertising and promotions to them.</p>
                    <h3>2.6 Profiles of Individuals.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.</p>
                    <h3>2.7 Storage of Individual Information.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer stores the Individual Information in a database on The Muscle Maximizer computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under The Muscle Maximizer's control. Not withstanding such measures, The Muscle Maximizer cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent The Muscle Maximizer computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.</p>

                    <h2>3. Dissemination of Individual Information.</h2>
                    <h3>3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN The Muscle Maximizer'S SOLE DISCRETION.
                    If you do not wish us to use personal information about you to promote or sell our products and services or to sell, transfer or otherwise provide personal information about you to third parties, please inform us by sending us an email and we will certainly honor your request.</p>
                    <h3>3.2 Order Fulfillment.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer will transfer Individual Information to third parties when necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders from such third party while using The Muscle Maximizer web sites or when responding to offers provided by The Muscle Maximizer.</p>
                    <h3>3.3 Legal Process.</h3>

                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.</p>
                    <h3>3.4 Summary Data.</h3>
                    <p>The Muscle Maximizer may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons.</p>
                    <h3>3.5 Access.</h3>
                    <p>Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such information. Access can be obtained by contacting customer service at the number on the order page. The Muscle Maximizer may also grant advertising clients and email services providers access to an individual's email address to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.</p>
                    <h2>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</h2>

                    <h3>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</h3>
                    <p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals. The Muscle Maximizer does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and The Muscle Maximizer has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about individuals.</p>
                    <h3>4.2 Links.</h3>

			LEGAL &amp; TESTIMONIAL DISCLAIMER<br>	<br>	
Individual Results may vary, and testimonials are not claimed to represent typical results. All testimonials are real guys, and may not reflect the typical purchaser's experience, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. Every guy has unique experiences, exercise habits, eating habits, and applies the information in a different way. Thus, the experiences that we share from other people may not reflect the typical users' experience. Due to recent statements from the FTC, it is required that we identify what a typical result is. The truth: most people never do anything with the products they buy, so most of the time, their typical results are zero. The biggest factor is your ability to follow through. There is no such thing as a Magic Bullet. Your effort will determine your results. However, the results portrayed in this presentation are meant as a showcase of what Kyle's best, most motivated users' have achieved. In addition, you assume certain risks inherent in exercise and nutrition programs by using this system. You should not begin the program if you have a physical condition that makes intense exercise dangerous. In addition, The Muscle Maximizer requires you to follow an eating plan and at times restrict the amount of calories you consume. You should not begin this eating plan if you have physical or psychological issues which make fat loss dangerous. The Muscle Maximizer is an educational service that provides general health information. Kyle is not a doctor, and his advice is not a substitute for medical advice. Please consult a physician before beginning any exercise or diet program
