<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1;">Last Updated: February 1, 2013</span></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of TheDailyLife.com website (“TheDailyLife,” “Website”, “Site,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). We are committed to advising you of the right to your privacy and strive to provide a safe and secure user experience. This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to this Website. By accessing or using this Website, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, the collection, use, storage, transfer and disclosure of the information provided by you or relating to you in the manner described herein. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it affects your rights and liabilities under the law. If you disagree with the way we collect and process information, please do not use this Website.</p>
<h2><strong>Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to this Website and regulates the processing of information relating to you and grants both us and you various rights with respect to your personal data. It describes what type of information we collect; how we use that information and to whom we can provide that information. It also informs you of how to notify us to stop using your information. Our Company is located in the United States. You may be located in a country that has laws that are more restrictive about the collection and use of your personal information. However, by using our Website, you agree to waive the more restrictive laws and agree to be governed by the laws of the United States.<br>
This Website and emails received from us may also posts links to other websites over which we have no control. As such, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites when you choose to link from this site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.<br>
We also do not control the data use practices of those persons or entities who may access your information on this site for the purposes of providing the service or product you have requested or third party Ad Networks and other third parties with whom we work to serve you personalized ads on our site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and opt-out choices of those third parties so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
<h2><strong>Use of Cookies, JavaScript &amp; Web Beacons</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>“Cookies” are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, we or a third party vendor may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site or our emails. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://www.cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of Company’s websites, you need to accept cookies.<br>
We may use “session” cookies, which are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. “Session” cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or registration.<br>
We may also use “persistent” cookies in part to ensure that we do not show you pages that you have already seen and to personalize your site experience and save you time. “Persistent” Cookies enable us to recognize whether you have responded to any questionnaire or registration or have already been presented with an advertisement or information placed on the site so that we do not show you the same information again the next time you visit our site or in the next email you receive from us. The “persistent” cookies we use will remain on your computer after you have left our site until you remove them.</p>
<p>We may also allow other companies to display advertisements to you while you are visiting our Sites and when opening our emails. Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the other companies’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. We have no control over the practices of those third party advertisers and are not responsible for their technology or tracking. We encourage you to review the policies of such advertisers when you link to their website.<br>
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p><strong>Removing Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You have the ability to accept, decline or move cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com or go tohttp://www.aboutads.info/choices. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the Website. You may opt out of cookies by clicking below:</p>
<p>http://www.aboutads.info/choicesJavaScript</p>
<p>We may also use JavaScript within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We do not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve the site’s functions.</p>
<p><strong>Disabling JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the functions of the website.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>We also use electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your visit to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements. We may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.</p>
<p><strong>Disabling Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the site or from our emails. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Profiles</strong></p>
<p>Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect &amp; Retain</strong><br>
We collect the following general types of information about you when you visit and use our Site or through our emails: personal information, demographic information, behavioral information, and indirect information. Sometimes we collect combinations of these types of information.<br>
Web Technology information is information we automatically collect from you when you open one of our emails or visit our site. This includes information collected from the use of cookies, web beacons or java script.</p>
<h2>No Information Collected from Children</h2>
<p>Company will never knowingly collect any Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.<br>
Personal information is information that can be used to identify you, or any other individual to whom the information may relate, personally. We do not collect personal information unless you choose to provide it to us. Some examples of personal information that we collect, depending on the services you use and local law, are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Telephone number</li>
<li>Any other information you provide to us though the course of communicating with us.</li>
<li>First and Last Name</li>
<li>Physical Address</li>
<li>Email address</li>

<p><strong>Telemarketing</strong></p>
<p>We may use your Personal Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. You may have your telephone number or cell phone number listed on a state or federal do not call registry.

(the “ATSR”). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, you have authorized us to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website or other advertisement media made available by us (e.g., email marketing), you agree that such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via email, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR.

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy Statement</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this Privacy Statement. We will post those changes so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.</p>
<h2>For California Residents</h2>
<p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.<br>
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.<br>
As stated in this policy, you have agreed to allow us to share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes until you remove your information and thus, agreement for such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites or contact us via email to remove your information from our database. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.<br>
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@thedailylife.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>
