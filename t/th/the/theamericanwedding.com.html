<h2>Information Collection and Use<a name="information_collection_use"></a></h2>

<h3>Information Collection</h3><a name="information_collection"></a>
  <p>The Company is the sole owner of the information collected 
  on our web sites. The Company collects information from our 
  users at different points on this web site.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Registration</b><br>
  In order to browse this web site, a user need not register. 
  To use advanced web site features, such as online 
  personalization, save my work or email to a friend, a user 
  must complete a short registration form where we will ask 
  for the user's name and email address. The user's email 
  address becomes the user's login ID. Account security is 
  protected by asking for a user defined password. Please do 
  not share your password with anyone. If lost or forgotten, 
  we have provided recovery features to help you retrieve your 
  forgotten password. <br>
  <br>
  Registration enables us to establish a user account 
  for you, and enables the advanced features. We also use this 
  information to provide a more personalized experience on our 
  site.<br>
  <br>
  Once your user account has been inactive for a period of 12
  months or more or if it is 6 months after the wedding date, 
  we may remove it from our online database and you will need 
  to re-register in order to use those features again.  Invalid 
  email addresses will be removed.
  <br><br>
  <b>Order</b><br>
  When ordering, we request additional information from the 
  user. This includes contact information (such as phone 
  number, and address) for billing and shipping, and financial 
  information (such as credit card number, expiration date or 
  checking account number and bank routing number). This 
  information is used for billing purposes and to fill 
  customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
  the information is used to contact the user.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Referrals</b><br>
  We believe in helping others. We believe that our customers 
  may wish to share their good experiences on our site with 
  their friends and relatives who may also be interested in 
  similar products. To this end, we may ask our customers to 
  provide us with email addresses of others who may enjoy 
  visiting our site. We will send a promotional email to those 
  referred, containing a link to our web site. We will 
  identify you as the person who has referred them to us. 
  Referring others to us is always voluntary.</p>

<h3>Information Use</h3><a name="information_use"></a>
  <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer 
  tied to information about the user. We use session ID 
  cookies and persistent cookies. Once users close the 
  browser, the session ID cookie simply terminates. A 
  persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's 
  hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent 
  cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. <br>
  <br>
  By allowing a cookie from our site, users would not have to 
  log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while 
  on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use 
  our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be 
  limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user 
  will not be able to participate in some marketing promotions 
  that may be offered from time to time, to users matching a 
  specific profile. Persistent cookies enable us to track and 
  target the interests of our users to enhance the experience 
  on our site.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>Log Files</b><br>
  Like most standard web sites, we use log files. This 
  includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, 
  internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, 
  platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to 
  analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement 
  in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information 
  for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to 
  personally identifiable information. The information we 
  gather through log files is never tied to your personally 
  identifiable information. We reserve the right to share 
  information we gather in the aggregate, through the use of 
  log files. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Communications from the Site</b><br>
  Special Offers and Updates<br>
  We send new registrants a 
  welcoming email to verify password and username. Established 
  members may occasionally receive information on products, 
  services and special promotions. Out of respect for the 
  privacy of our users we present the option to not receive 
  these types of communications. Please see the Opt-in/out &amp; 
  Update section.<br>
  <br>
  Service Announcements<br>
  Service announcements are not promotional in nature. They 
  are sent to our customers to provide specific services or 
  information. For instance, when a customer's order is 
  shipped from our manufacturing facility, we will advise the 
  customer by email of the shipping specifics, and provide (if 
  applicable) a tracking number, and method for the customer 
  to track their order. We may send email notices to our users 
  advising them of changes to this policy, or to our terms and 
  conditions. Additionally, from time to time, we may send a 
  service email to all our users in order to clean our 
  database. Such messages allow us to purge invalid email 
  addresses, and also afford all users an opportunity to 
  review and change, if desired, their opt in/opt out status.<br>
  <br>
  Customer Service<br>
  We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide 
  requested services. In regard to issues relating to their 
  account we may reply via email or phone, fax, postal mail, 
  or such other communications as we deem most appropriate.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Sharing<br></b>
  </p><div>Legal Disclaimer</div>
  Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we 
  may need to disclose personal information when required by 
  law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is 
  necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a 
  court order or legal process served on our web site.<br>
  <br>
  Third Party Intermediaries<br>
  We use third party credit card processing and check 
  processing companies to bill users for goods and services. 
  These companies do not retain, share, store or use 
  personally identifiable information for any secondary 
  purposes.<br>
  <br>
  Business Transitions<br>
  In the event the Company goes through a business transition, 
  such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or 
  selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information 
  will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Opt-in/out &amp; Update</b><br>
  By using our web site, our users agree to the uses of 
  information described in this statement, and are "opting-in" 
  to receive communications as herein described. Our users 
  always have a choice. They are given the opportunity to 
  'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not 
  directly related to our site. Users who no longer wish to 
  receive our promotional communications may opt-out of 
  receiving these communications by following the opt-out 
  instructions contained in the email or clicking <a href="/optoutdb.asp">here</a>.  Our users may update 
  their information in "My Account" at any time.<p></p>
  
  <br>
  <b>Links</b><br>
  This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be 
  aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
  of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
  leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each 
  and every web site that collects personally identifiable 
  information. This privacy statement applies solely to 
  information collected by this web site.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
  From time to time, our site may request information from 
  users via surveys or contests. Participation in these 
  surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user 
  therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this 
  information. The requested information typically includes 
  contact information (such as name and shipping address), and 
  demographic information (such as zip code). Contact 
  information will be used to notify the winners and award 
  prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of 
  monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this 
  site. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these 
  surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally 
  identifiable information for any secondary purposes. <br>
  <b><br>
  Email To Friend</b><br>
  If a user elects to use our Email To Friend feature, for 
  inviting a friend or relative to comment on a particular 
  project the user is working on, we provide a form for our 
  user to enter the friend’s email address, their own email 
  address (to identify who it is from) and to add a note to 
  the friend. The Company will automatically send the friend 
  an email containing a link to preview the user's work. The 
  friend will only be able to view the user's project. The 
  friend will not have access to the user's account, personal 
  information or other projects. The friend will not be able 
  to change, edit, modify, add or delete anything from the 
  user's account or saved work file. The Company may add text 
  to your email to a friend, offering the visiting friend the 
  opportunity to establish their own account. Special 
  promotional offers may also be inserted in the email 
  invitations to your friends. The Company NEVER harvests the 
  email addresses you insert in the email to a friend form, 
  for any purpose, including follow on promotional emails. We 
  do not send unsolicited promotional emails.

<h2>Security<a name="security"></a></h2>
  <p>This web site takes reasonable precautions to protect our users' 
  information. When users submit sensitive information via the 
  web site, their information is protected both online and 
  off-line.<br>
  <br>
  When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
  sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is 
  protected with the best encryption software in the industry 
  - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the 
  lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape 
  Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as 
  opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 
  'surfing'.<br>
  <br>
  While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
  online, we also take steps to protect user-information 
  off-line. All of our users' information, not just the 
  sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our 
  offices. Only employees who need the information to perform 
  a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer 
  service representative) are granted access to personally 
  identifiable information.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Personal Information</b><br>
  We use the information internally, to insure the accurate 
  and timely fulfillment of the user's order. We may also use 
  the information internally, for specific marketing or 
  promotional campaigns, as described within this statement. 
  We may share some information with our affiliate partners 
  and/or our third-party affiliate management company, to 
  ensure proper payment of affiliate commissions.
  From time to time, we may sell, license or rent 
  lists, containing your name and address information, but 
  never email address, credit card or payment information, to 
  others, unless you request us not to do so. Our users’ 
  election, to have their information shared, or withheld, may 
  be changed at time of ordering. We NEVER sell, license or 
  rent your email address to others.</p>
  <b>Billing Information</b><br>
  Billing information, including credit card account numbers, 
  expiration dates, checking account numbers and bank routing 
  identifiers are never shared with third parties, except 
  those companies associated with order and payment 
  processing. 
  <p><b>SSL Encryption</b><br>
  Digital certificates encrypt data using 
  <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/tech/security/ssl/howitworks.html" target="_blank">Secure Sockets Layer</a>
  (SSL) technology, the industry-standard method for protecting web communications developed by 
  Netscape Communications Corporation. The SSL security protocol provides data 
  encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client 
  authentication for a TCP/IP connection. Because SSL is built into all major 
  browsers and web servers, simply installing a digital certificate turns on their 
  SSL capabilities. <br>
  SSL comes in two strengths, 40-bit and 128-bit, which refer to the length of the 
  "session key" generated by every encrypted transaction. The longer the key, the 
  more difficult it is to break the encryption code. Most browsers support 40-bit 
  SSL sessions, and the latest browsers enable users to encrypt transactions in 
  128-bit sessions - trillions of times stronger than 40-bit sessions. Our web 
  site supports 128-bit sessions. </p>

<h2>Additional Information <a name="additional_information"></a></h2>
  <p><b>Children's Guidelines</b><br>
  The Company is committed to protecting the online privacy of children. We will 
  not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from or about 
  children under the age of 16 without prior parental consent. If you are under 16 
  and would like to purchase items from the Company, or provide personal 
  information about yourself or your family, please ask a parent or guardian for 
  assistance.<br>
  The Company cannot prevent minors from visiting this site. The Company must rely 
  on parents, guardians and those responsible for supervising children under the 
  age of 16 to decide which materials are appropriate for such children to view 
  and/or purchase.<br>
  <br>
  Each time you purchase a product from this site, or provide information about 
  yourself or your family, you are representing to the Company that you are 16 
  years or older.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
  We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at our sole discretion. If 
  we change our privacy policy, we will post the new, updated privacy statement on 
  our web site, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware 
  of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if 
  any, we disclose it. We may, at our option, send an email notification to our 
  users, advising them of changes to this policy, or changes in our terms and 
  conditions.<br>
