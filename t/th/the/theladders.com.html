<p>TheLadders.com is located at 137 Varick Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10013. We can be contacted at help@theladders.com</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information through our web sites located under the second level domain TheLadders.com (the "Web sites"). "Personal Information" means information that would allow a party to contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us.  Our goal is to earn and keep your trust, according to the following principles:
    </p><ul>
    <li>We will never trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes</li>
    <li>We will never share your contact information with a recruiter or hiring manager, unless both of you choose to contact one another regarding an open position</li>
    <li>Any sensitive information that you provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols and technology</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information.</p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br>
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties - ever. Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use of our Web sites, that information does not contain personal information. However, we may share personal information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Web sites. In the case of criminal investigations, including but not limited to fraud or alleged illegal activity, we may also be obligated to share your personal information with law enforcement, government, and/or credit card issuing banks.</p>
<p>If TheLadders.com becomes part of another organization, that organization will possess the Personal Information collected by TheLadders.com and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use other third parties to provide Web analytics on our site. When you sign up for TheLadders.com, we will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use That Information</strong><br>
Our basic registration forms require users to provide contact information, including name, email address, zip code, and income information. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. Should you choose to purchase services, your credit card information will be stored. We use this information for billing purposes only. If we have trouble processing your order, we will use your information to contact you.</p>
<p>We will use your Personal Information for internal purposes only and will never trade your Personal Information with any third parties. Sensitive information such as your income level and credit card information will be kept completely private.</p>
<p>Should you post a resume, the amount of information you choose to keep confidential is entirely up to your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as you choose. All information posted will only be visible to recruiters and companies seeking employees. All recruiters are strictly screened and have been determined by TheLadders.com to be legitimately seeking applicants for open positions.</p>
<p>In your use of the site, we also store such information as jobs you've applied to, jobs you've viewed, your resume, and similar information ("Personal Information"). We track clickstream data to monitor utilization and ensure good customer experience. We also use Personal Information to provide you with targeted job information. In some instances in the future we may share your personal information with third party contractors for the sole purpose of mailing you materials on our behalf.</p>
<p>We use other third parties to provide credit card processing services on our site. When you sign up for Premium membership, we will only process your full payment information including credit cards through a third party payment processor that is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant.</p>
<p>We post customer reviews on our Web site, which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the review to post their name along with their review.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletters</strong><br>
If you wish to subscribe to our email communications, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.  Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</p>

<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
When you register for our site, we use your email address to send you internal communications from TheLadders.com.  If youâ€™ve registered to receive email communications from us and later change your mind, you may contact us to have your name removed from our distribution lists. You may Opt-out to any of our communications by changing your Account Settings.  Please go to Account Settings and indicate from which distribution lists you would like to have your name removed.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Protocol Address</strong><br>
Like most websites, we collect Internet Protocol ("IP") address from all visitors to the Web site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Web site, and deliver customized, personalized content.</p>

<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  TheLadders.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, tracking the success of our referral program, and following up with additional information if the friend has opted-in.
</p><p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:help@theladders.com">help@theladders.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<p><strong>Use of "Cookies"</strong><br>
Again like most websites, we may use cookies to enhance your experience on our Web site. Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that Web site and are used for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords and your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular Web site. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you enter into your account settings on our site. This link is only used internally for site usage tracking.</p>
<p>As the use of cookies is considered industry standard, your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, our Web site will not function properly.</p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at help@theladders.com.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
TheLadders.com has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Web site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of TheLadders.com. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information.</p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p><strong>Other Web sites</strong><br>
Our Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website over which TheLadders.com has no control and will bear no responsibility. Often these sites require you to enter your personal information as you apply for a job directly with the hiring company.  We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such Web sites as their policies may differ from ours.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
We may disclose your Personal Information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TheLadders.com.</p>

<p>As such, we cannot ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
