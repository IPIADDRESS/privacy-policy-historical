<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
We do not sell or rent Your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties to You.  We use other third parties to provide Web analytics on our site. When You sign up for TheLadders.com, we will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service.  Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use of our Website, that information does not contain Personal Information.

<p>As TheLadders.com continues to develop its business, TheLadders.com might sell or buy lines of business or assets. If all or substantially all of TheLadders.com's business (or a line of business) or assets (or the assets of a line of TheLadders.com's business) are acquired by a third party, Personal Information of TheLadders.com users will generally be one of the transferred business assets.  We reserve the right to include Your collected Personal Information and other information we collect as described herein as an asset in any such transfer to a third party.
</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use That Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Use of "Cookies"</strong></p>

<p>Like most websites, we may use cookies to enhance Your experience on our Website. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website and are used for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving Your passwords and Your personal preferences regarding Your use of the particular website. We do link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information You enter into Your account settings on the Website. This link is only used internally for Website usage tracking and for re-marketing TheLadders' product and services to you.</p>
<p>As the use of cookies is considered industry standard, Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if You would prefer not to receive cookies, You can alter the configuration of Your browser to refuse cookies. If You choose to have Your browser refuse cookies, our Website will not function properly.</p>
<p>Our third party advertising partner(s) employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. This information is used by TheLadders for internal use only and is not sold or rented to third parties for purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect Your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Other Web sites</strong></p>
<p>Our Website contains links to other websites. Please note that when You click on one of these links, You are entering another website over which TheLadders.com has no control and will bear no responsibility. Often these websites require You to enter Your Personal Information as You apply for a job directly with the hiring company. We encourage You to read the privacy statements on all such websites as their policies may differ from ours.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose Your Personal Information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TheLadders.com.</p>
<p>As such, we cannot ensure that Your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
