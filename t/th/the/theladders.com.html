Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which We collect, use and protect Your Personal Information.  If We make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, We will notify You in accordance with the process described in the Terms of Use.
</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
We do not sell or rent Your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties to You.  We use other third parties to provide Web analytics on our site. When You sign up for TheLadders.com, We will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service.  Although We may disclose aggregated information about the use of our Website, that information does not contain Personal Information.  We may share Personal Information with our contractors and service providers solely for the purpose of maintaining, enhancing, or adding to the functionality of the Website. In the case of criminal investigations, including but not limited to fraud or alleged illegal activity, We may share Your Personal Information with law enforcement, government, and/or credit card issuing banks.
</p>
<p>In accordance with California Civil Code Section 1798.83, We will not provide Your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing purposes. California residents may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing <a href="mailto:CaliforniaPrivacy@theladders.com">CaliforniaPrivacy@theladders.com</a>.  Please note that We are only required to respond to one request per customer per year and We are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
<p>As TheLadders.com continues to develop its business, TheLadders.com might sell or buy lines of business or assets. If all or substantially all of TheLadders.com's business (or a line of business) or assets (or the assets of a line of TheLadders.com's business) are acquired by a third party, Personal Information of TheLadders.com users will generally be one of the transferred business assets.  We reserve the right to include Your collected Personal Information and other information We collect as described herein as an asset in any such transfer to a third party.
</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use That Information</strong></p>
<p>Our basic registration forms require users to provide contact information, including name, email address, zip code, and income information. We use this information to contact You about the services on our site in which You have expressed interest. Should You choose to purchase services, Your credit card information will be stored. We use your credit card information for billing purposes only. If We have trouble processing Your order, We will use Your contact information to contact You.
</p>

<p>Should You post a resume, the amount of information You choose to keep confidential is entirely up to Your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as You choose. All information posted will only be visible to recruiters and companies seeking employees. All recruiters are believed by TheLadders.com to be legitimately seeking applicants for available positions.
</p>In Your use of the Website, We also store such information as jobs You've applied to, jobs You've viewed, Your resume, and similar information. We track clickstream data to monitor utilization and ensure good customer experience. We also use Personal Information to provide You with targeted job information.
<p>We use other third parties to provide credit card processing services on our Website. When You sign up for Premium membership, We will only process Your full payment information including credit cards through a third party payment processor that is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant.
</p>
<p>We post customer reviews on our Web site, which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the review to post their name along with their review.
</p>

<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>If You wish to subscribe to our email communications, We will use Your name and email address to send the newsletter to You. Out of respect for Your privacy, We provide You with a way to way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice/Opt-out" section.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Protocol Address</strong></p>
<p>
Like most websites, We collect Internet Protocol ("IP") address from all visitors to the Website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet.

We will automatically send Your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. TheLadders.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, tracking the success of our referral program, and following up with additional information if the friend has opted-in.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:help@theladders.com">help@theladders.com</a> to request that We remove this information from our database.</p>

<p><strong>Use of "Cookies"</strong></p>

<p>Like most websites, We may use cookies to enhance Your experience on our Website. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website and are used for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving Your passwords and Your personal preferences regarding Your use of the particular website. We do link the information We store in cookies to any Personal Information You enter into Your account settings on the Website. This link is only used internally for Website usage tracking and for re-marketing TheLadders' product and services to you.</p>

<p>Our third party advertising partner(s) employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. This information is used by TheLadders for internal use only and is not sold or rented to third parties for purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>TheLadders.com has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While We strive to protect Your Personal Information, We cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Other Web sites</strong></p>
<p>Our Website contains links to other websites. Please note that when You click on one of these links, You are entering another website over which TheLadders.com has no control and will bear no responsibility. Often these websites require You to enter Your Personal Information as You apply for a job directly with the hiring company. We encourage You to read the privacy statements on all such websites as their policies may differ from ours.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose Your Personal Information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TheLadders.com.</p>
<p>As such, We cannot ensure that Your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, We may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
