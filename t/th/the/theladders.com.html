</p>
<p>
    We use cookies and other tracking technologies (including technologies designed specifically for mobile applications) to collect information about you and

    Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to your computer, through your web browser, for record-keeping purposes. Use of
    cookies makes web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords and your preferences regarding use of the particular
    website. Cookies also allow us to track your activities at our Site and provide you with personalized display advertising. To opt out of this advertising,

</p>
<p>
    Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The
    "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you
    when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies, however, our Site will not function properly.
</p>
<p>
    Clear GIFs. We and our third party service providers and third party advertising partner(s) may clear gifs (a.k.a. pixel tags/Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear
    gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website users. In contrast
    to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on webpages and are about the size of the period at the end
    of this sentence. We may use clear GIFs, in connection with our Site, to among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content,
    and compile statistics about Site usage. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' Personal Information. We and our third party
    service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our users, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track
    whether our e-mails are forwarded.

<p>
    Local Storage Objects. We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are

<p id="third-party-ad">
    <strong>Third-Party Ad Networks</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites or other websites. Network advertisers are third parties that
    display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by
    displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic
    measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of
    their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific
    privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as
    aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.
</p>
<p>
    You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital
    Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this
    information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective
    websites: <a href="http://www.theladders.com/www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> (NAI) and

</p>
<p>
    Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted
    content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive
    advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit
    this opt-out page, or you later erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.
