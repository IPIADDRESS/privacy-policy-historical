<p>Ladders wants you to fully understand our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information through our web sites located at URLs: http://www.salesladder.com, http://www.mktgladder.com, http://www.financeladder.com and http://www.upladder.com (the “Web sites”). “Personal Information” means information that would allow a party to contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information.</p>
<p>Ladders reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and without any notice by posting a revised Privacy Policy on our Web site. Any such revision will become effective immediately upon posting.</p>
<h2><a name="personal" class="anchor" id="personal">Disclosure of Personal Information</a></h2>
<p>We do not share, sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use of our Web sites, that information does not contain Personal Information. Generally, we do not disclose Personal Information to third parties. However, we may share Personal Information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Web sites.

<p>We cannot ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
<h2><a name="optout" id="optout" class="anchor">Choice/Opt-out</a></h2>
<p>If you have registered to receive email communications from us and later change your mind, you may contact us to have your name removed from our distribution lists.
