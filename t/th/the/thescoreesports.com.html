  This Privacy Policy describes the information that Score Media Ventures Inc.
  and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("we," "our" or "us") collect through
  websites that we operate and any mobile application of ours (each, an "App")
  (collectively, the "Service"), how we use, disclose and protect your
  information and the choices you can make about your information.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">1. CONSENT</h2>
<p>
  By accessing the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use,
  disclosure and storage of your information and other information received by us
  as a result of such use in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of
  Use or your consent, and as permitted or required by applicable law.  If you do
  not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, you should
  immediately stop using or visiting the Service. Please note that the Service
  may be hosted in countries other than yours, including the United States. By
  accessing the Service, you expressly consent to the transfer of your
  information outside of your home country, which may provide for different data
  protection rules than in your country. We make use of third-party service
  providers, including service providers located in Canada, the United States and
  the European Union to store and process data, including your information, on
  our behalf.  When acting on our behalf, such service providers are only
  authorized to collect, use, disclose or store personal information as described
  in this Privacy Policy.  However, the government, courts, law enforcement,
  security, or regulatory agencies of a particular country may be able to obtain
  access to or disclosure of personal information as permitted by the laws of
  that country.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions in this regard may be directed to the Privacy Compliance Officer using the contact information provided below.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">2. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
  We collect the following types of information as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> a. Information you provide us directly:</strong> We may ask for certain information such as your name, postal address, email
  address, telephone number, password, third party social networking service user name or user ID and password and other information to use the Service, or if
  you contact or interact with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may retain other information you voluntarily provide
  us with including your comments and other content. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the
  Service, and as further detailed below.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b. Information we may collect receive from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties including third party
  social networking services. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or
  connecting them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. We also
  may collect information about you from third party business partners, publicly available sources and our subsidiaries and affiliates.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c. Analytics information.</strong> We may directly collect information or we or our third party business partners may use analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
  Please visit <a href="/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences">http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences</a> for additional information about how you can manage preferences regarding analytics information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>d. Cookies information:</strong> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file
  containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your device that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your
  navigation through the Service. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click
  and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie
  remains on your device after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies
  can be removed by following your browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can set your browser
  to refuse certain cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept
  cookies is limited or disabled.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>e. Log file information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you
  access a Web page or other content within the Service. We may also receive log information relating to your use of our Apps.  When you use the Service, our
  servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
  address, operating system, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names,
  landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. This information is used to monitor, assess, diagnose problems with, and improve the Service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>f. Clear gifs/web beacons information:</strong> Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used to anonymously track the online
  usage patterns of our users.  We also may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked
  by recipients. You can disable the ability of clear gifs to track certain information by setting your browser to refuse certain cookies. The information
  allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>g. Device identifiers:</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not
  limited to smart phones or tablets), we or our third party business partners may access, assign, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more unique
  identifiers, such as a universally unique identifier (UUID). Unique identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with
  your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A unique identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data
  stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A unique identifier may convey information to us
  about how you browse and use the Service. A unique identifier may also be used to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>h. Advertising identifiers:</strong> Advertising identifiers are unique strings associated with your mobile device provided by the operating system. Please visit <a href="/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences">http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences</a>
  for additional information about how you can reset advertising identifiers and limit advertising tracking.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>i. Location data:</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access,
  collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding
  the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service,
  particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>j. Commercial and marketing communications:</strong> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with
  you. We may send you electronic messages containing Service-related notices (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders,
  feature notifications, technical and security notices).  We may also send you electronic messages containing promotions and special offers.  You can also
  stop receiving electronic messages (other than Service-related notices) from us by clicking on the "unsubscribe link" provided in such communications or by
  changing your account preferences or settings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>k. Use of certain service type information we collect:</strong> We use or may use cookies, log files, unique identifiers, advertising
  identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (i) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the
  next time you visit the Service, (ii) provide personalized content and information, (iii) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the Service; (iv)
  monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, (v) diagnose or fix technology problems, (vi) help you
  efficiently access your information after you sign in, (vii) provide targeted advertising to your browser or device, (viii) automatically update our App on
  your mobile devices, (ix) allow you to comment on or provide content and participate in contests or promotions and (x) conduct research or surveys.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>l. With consent:</strong> We may use your information for any other purpose for which you consent.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>m.  Combining information we collect:</strong> We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
  Information may be disclosed to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>a. Who we may share your information with:</strong> We may share your information with third party business partners that function
  on our behalf in connection with the Service. We may share information about you that they need to perform their functions. We will use contractual or other
  means to protect personal information disclosed to such third parties. We may also share your information with any subsidiary or affiliate of ours for
  purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.  Any subsidiary or affiliate of ours will be required to maintain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b. Who you may choose to share Your Content with; removal of content:</strong> Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the
  Service, such as Your Content (as defined in the Terms of Use at <a href="/pages/terms">http://www.thescore.com/pages/terms</a>), becomes available to the public, except
  as limited by any privacy settings made available on the Service.  Subject to your privacy settings, any of Your Content that you voluntarily make public may
  be searchable by others.  If you remove information or content that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the
  Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information or content. If you are a California resident under age 18 and a registered Service user, you
  may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Service by emailing us at <a class="txt-highlight" href="mailto:privacy@thescore.com">privacy@thescore.com</a>.
  Please note that such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted
  (for example, your content or information may remain visible because it was copied and posted or reposted by a third party).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c. What happens in the event of a business change:</strong> If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets,
  joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially
  all of our business otherwise changes, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>d. Instances where we are required to share your information:</strong> Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent
  permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the Terms of Use or any applicable
  end user license agreement; (ii) comply with law, in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process or cooperate
  with government or law enforcement officials or private parties; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety and property, or that of our users or others;
  (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action
  regarding suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, the rights, reputation, safety or property of us, users or others, violation of the Terms
  of Use, our policies or agreements or as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>e. Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</strong> We may share certain service type information, including information obtained
  through tools such as cookies, log files, unique identifiers, advertising identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data,
  referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third party business partners for the purposes described in the section above
  on "How We Collect and Use Information." We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that
  aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>f. Ads on the Service:</strong> We may also share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data, unique identifier data, advertising identifier data and other data
  relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements ("ads") that may be of interest to you. We may allow third party
  ad platforms to serve advertisements on the Service. These third party ad platforms use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device,
  the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your Internet Protocol address when they do so. They may also use other
  technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, unique identifiers, advertising identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information
  about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on the Service, measure the effectiveness of their ads, and personalize the advertising
  content.  You can opt out of receiving certain cookies by adjusting your browser settings to refuse certain cookies or to alert you when a cookie is
  placed.  You can also reset advertising identifiers and limit advertising tracking. (See <strong>"Your Choices About Your Information"</strong> below).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We do not sell, rent, or share information about personally identifying characteristics (e.g., name, email address, age, gender) we collect directly
  from you or about you from third parties with third party ad platforms for their own marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have such
  information shared for this purpose.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please note that an advertiser may ask us to show an ad to a certain audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation,
  we determine the target audience and we serve the advertising to that audience and only provide anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to
  such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
</p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">4. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
  We care about the security of your information, and take physical, technological and administrative measures to protect the information you submit
  via the Service against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
  information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. Electronic communications
  sent to or from the Service may not be secure. You should use caution whenever submitting information online and take special care in deciding what
  information you send to us via email.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">5. YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
