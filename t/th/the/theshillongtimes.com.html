            <h1>Comments/Privacy Policy</h1>

            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which The Shillong Times collects, uses, display, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the <a href="http://www.theshillongtimes.com">http://www.theshillongtimes.com</a> website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by The Shillong Times.</p>
<p><b>Comments disclaimer</b></p>
<p>The Shillong Times allows readers to post comments to almost all our online content. But that doesn’t give you the right to abuse this facility.</p>
<p>We will not delete comments based on their political or ideological viewpoint. We may, however, delete comments that are off-topic, use excessive foul language, or employ slurs based on race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. We may also delete comments that make personal attacks on story subjects — especially if those attacks are threatening, unrelated to the content of the piece or are unsupported by factual evidence. If you want to use the internet to settle personal scores, you might want to try starting your own blog.</p>
<p>The fact that a comment remains on the site does not imply the endorsement of The Shillong Times. The Shillong Times makes no representation as to the accuracy of any assertions made in the comments section. The Shillong Times assumes no liability for any statements made by third parties in the comments sections of its Web site.</p>
