                         TheSingingZone.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of  Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized  experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,  e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms  of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email  address to any unauthorized third party. Period."<br>
                         <strong><br>
    How we gather information from users</strong><br>
                       How we collect and store information depends on the page you are  visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the  services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information  when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request  certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You  may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and  contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of  our site. Like most Web sites, TheSingingZone.com also collects  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that  may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of  your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize  you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the  cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having  to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the  number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting  our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather  information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not  to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to  refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access  certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name  and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features  according to your preferences.<br>
                       <strong><br>
    What we do with the information we collect</strong><br>
                     Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit  and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect  your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</span></p>
                     <p class="style14">Aggregated  Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be  used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to  help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are  visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and  business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
                     <p class="style14">We may use Personally  Identifiable Information collected on TheSingingZone.com to communicate  with you about your registration and customization preferences; our  Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by  TheSingingZone.com and other topics we think you might find of  interest. </p>
                     <p class="style14">Personally Identifiable Information  collected by TheSingingZone.com may also be used for other purposes,  including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,  processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes  and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties  who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use  your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to  time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or  partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user  information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose  your information in response to a court order, at other times when we  believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with  the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement  authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note  we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
                         <strong><br>
                           Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong><br>
                       TheSingingZone.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third  parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other  content providers accessible through our site, may have their own  privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during  your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a  TheSingingZone.com page, certain content that is actually created or  hosted by a third party. Also, through TheSingingZone.com you may be  introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,  contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. TheSingingZone.com is  not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You  should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties  when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third  party.</p>
                     <p class="style14">While  on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some  of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example,  some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include  cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a  particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site  may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or  other technology to gather information. TheSingingZone.com does not  control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting  information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such  third parties.</p>
                     <p class="style14">You should also be aware that if  you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message  boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and  can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and  may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third  parties. Such activities are beyond the control of TheSingingZone.com  and this policy.<br>
                         <strong><br>
