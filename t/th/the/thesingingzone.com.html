            <p align="left"><br>
              TheSingingZone.com strives   to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide   an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable   Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number)   subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent   your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."<br><strong><br>How   we gather information from users</strong><br>How we collect and store   information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you   elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to   provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site   or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase.   You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,   message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like   most Web sites, TheSingingZone.com also collects information automatically and   through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For   example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie   technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other   things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from   having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the   number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our   site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,   but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be   asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to   customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.<br><strong><br>What   we do with the information we collect</strong><br>Like other Web publishers, we   collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized   content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your   information with anyone. </p>
            <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally   identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information   about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to   help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most   or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally   be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information   does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow   anyone to identify you individually.</p>
            <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on   TheSingingZone.com to communicate with you about your registration and   customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and   products offered by TheSingingZone.com and other topics we think you might find   of interest. </p>

            <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by   TheSingingZone.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not   limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce   transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other   communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for   the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such   information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,   from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy,   merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user   information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your   information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are   reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of   amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we   deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice   prior to disclosure in such cases.<br><strong><br>Affiliated sites, linked sites   and advertisements</strong><br>TheSingingZone.com expects its partners,   advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,   however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and   other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy   and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to   our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a TheSingingZone.com   page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,   through TheSingingZone.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,   information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other   parties. TheSingingZone.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of   such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those   third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a   third party.</p>
            <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or   other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify   some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of   our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable   the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement   before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by   third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.   TheSingingZone.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties   or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies   of such third parties.</p>
            <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose   Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that   information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third   parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other   individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of   TheSingingZone.com and this   policy.<br><strong><br>Children</strong><br>TheSingingZone.com does not   knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about   children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received   any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will   delete that information immediately. If you believe TheSingingZone.com has any   information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address   listed below.</p>
