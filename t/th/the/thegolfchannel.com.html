<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><br>TheGolfChannel.com's  PRIVACY POLICY<br><br>TheGolfChannel.com's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users.  We want our users to be comfortable using our site.  This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. <br><br>REGISTRATION<br><br>You may use most portions of this site without providing any personal information.  However, in order to use many of the interactive features of this site, such as the TGC Locker, fantasy sports and contests, you must be a registered user.  Registration may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, mailing address and birth date. TheGolfChannel.com needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with TheGolfChannel.com policies and federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.<br><br>USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br><br>TheGolfChannel.com will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, certain personal information required to enter a sweepstakes or contest may be shared with TheGolfChannel.com's partners.  Please review the rules of the sweepstakes or contest carefully before disclosing any personal information.  Also, TheGolfChannel.com may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) TheGolfChannel.com's rights or property, other TheGolfChannel.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. TheGolfChannel.com may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. <br><br>TheGolfChannel.com shares aggregate information (data that does not contain personally identifiable information) about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say TheGolfChannel.com's audience is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize TheGolfChannel.com content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users. <br><br>OPTING-OUT<br><br>Information provided at the time of Registration or submission from a guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by TheGolfChannel.com and our affiliates or companies that have been prescreened by TheGolfChannel.com. To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of the following services: receiving communications from TheGolfChannel.com about new features or services, and receiving communications about offers from third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you.  Please remember that certain personal information is required to enter a sweepstakes or contest and that information may be shared with TheGolfChannel.com's partners.  Please review the rules of the sweepstakes or contest carefully before entering. <br><br>Information provided when purchasing products from any of our online stores (except for credit card information) may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes described on, or linked to, each order form.<br><br>REVISING YOUR PROFILE<br><br>In case you change your mind about your opt out decision or if some of your personal information changes (such as your zip code), we will provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this at the member information page or by contacting our Customer Support organization at webmaster@tgcinc.com . <br><br>POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)<br><br>TheGolfChannel.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at TheGolfChannel.com by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. <br><br>It is our policy to collect a minimum of information from guests under 13 years of age.  We request only the information required to ensure guests under 13 can effectively join in our activities, and do not condition participation in a particular activity on the collection of more information than is reasonably necessary.  TheGolfChannel.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our guests under 13 years of age. When a guest under 13 registers wants to register, he/she is required to provide the e-mail address or other contact information of his/her parent or guardian prior to Registration.  TheGolfChannel.com will notify the parent or guardian that the guest under 13 years of age wants to register and direct the parent or guardian to a page within TheGolfChannel.com where they can register the guest under 13 years of age.  All registrants and their parents or guardians receive an e-mail confirming their Registration. The parent or guardian must validate the account, as described in the e-mail, in order for the potential member to use most of TheGolfChannel.com interactive services. If the parent or guardian does not validate the account, any personally identifying information provided in the Registration will be discarded and the guest under 13 years of age will only be able to access portions of TheGolfChannel.com that do not require Registration.  No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside TheGolfChannel.com. <br><br>Although guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial registration process. Publication of contest winners' names, ages, or images for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent.  Please review the rules of each contest or promotion to see if guests under 13 years of age may participate.<br><br>We do not allow guests under 13 years of age to be listed in our member directory or to receive direct marketing communications from TheGolfChannel.com.<br><br>The parent or guardian of any guest under 13 years of age may review and modify the guest's personal information at the member services page at [INSERT LINK TO MEMBER SERVICES PAGE] or by contacting our webmaster at webmaster@tgcinc.com.<br><br>POLICIES FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF AGE)<br><br>Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian and a  notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all guests who are 13 to 17 years of age which identifies the information supplied at registration and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of the guest member's online experience.<br><br>USE OF IP ADDRESSES<br><br>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. <br><br>TheGolfChannel.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from TheGolfChannel.com site, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.<br><br>USE OF COOKIES<br><br> Cookies are pieces of data that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard. <br><br>By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs.<br><br>TheGolfChannel.com primarily uses cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the TheGolfChannel.com service that our users find valuable. While this activity depends on the use of a "cookie," visitors to TheGolfChannel.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Information from cookies is sometimes attached to messages sent to our Customer Service department. <br> <br>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the TheGolfChannel.com service will not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games.<br><br>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers if you "click" on an advertisement that takes you from TheGolfChannel.com to the advertiser's website. TheGolfChannel.com does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.<br><br>LINKS TO OTHER SITES<br><br>Users should be aware that when you are on TheGolfChannel.com, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from TheGolfChannel.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a TheGolfChannel.com search result, the "click" takes you off the TheGolfChannel.com site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use TheGolfChannel.com logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.<br><br>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While TheGolfChannel.com strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.<br><br>TheGolfChannel.com's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond TheGolfChannel.com's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. <br><br>SECURITY<br><br>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, TheGolfChannel.com can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.<br><br>Your TheGolfChannel.com Account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. TheGolfChannel.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.<br>Remember to sign out of your TheGolfChannel.com account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or internet café.<br><br>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS<br><br>By using this site, you signify your assent to the TheGolfChannel.com Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the TheGolfChannel.com sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. <br><br><br>If you have questions regarding this statement should be directed to the webmaster by email at webmaster@tgcinc.com, by phone at (407) 248-3300, or by postal mail at: TheGolfChannel.com ATTN: Webmaster, 7657 Commerce Center Drive, Orlando, Florida 32819 <br><br></font></p>
