<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains to Users of the LevelUp website
(<a href="/">https://www.thelevelup.com/</a>), mobile applications offered by or powered by LevelUp,
microsites, software and service (collectively, the "Service"), how SCVNGR, Inc., doing
business as LevelUp ("LevelUp", "we" or "us"), gathers and uses information collected in
connection with use of the Service and the LevelUp platform. LevelUp takes reasonable steps
to protect User privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Policy and
with all applicable laws. In this Privacy Policy, "User" or "you" means any person using the
Service, whether by browsing the LevelUp website or using LevelUp mobile apps, paying for
items and/or transactions using the LevelUp application, engaging in loyalty and rewards
programs ("Programs") offered by LevelUp merchants (each a "Merchant"), or participating in
any other activities available through the Service.
</p>
<p>
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE AND/OR THE LEVELUP PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE
READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR USER TERMS OF SERVICE
(<a href="/terms">https://www.thelevelup.com/terms</a>). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE
SERVICE.
</p>
<h2>2. First Up, We Want You to Know This:</h2>
<p>
You control your personal information on the LevelUp platform. We will never disclose your
email address, transaction history, or other information to any Merchant or any other third
party for their marketing purposes without you first authorizing that Merchant or third
party to access such information. This allows you to use the LevelUp Service and LevelUp
platform without receiving a whole lot of direct marketing you don't want.
</p>
<h2>3. Why Do We Have This Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>
All companies that you do business with choose whether and how they want share your personal
information. Federal law gives you the right to limit some, but not all, of that sharing.
Federal law also requires companies to tell you how they collect, share, and protect your
personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
</p>
<h2>4. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>
<span class="underline">Personal Information</span>:
LevelUp collects some of your identifying information in connection with the Service,
depending on how you use the Service. When you create a LevelUp User Account (whether
through a LevelUp App or LevelUp website), pay with LevelUp, engage in a Program, submit
content to LevelUp, complete a survey, send us feedback, request information about the
Service, apply for a job, or sign up for special offers from third parties, LevelUp may
collect information from you, which could include the following (collectively, "Personal
Information"):
</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>
<p>
first and last name
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
mailing address
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
email address
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
telephone number
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

the amount of credit earned and redeemed, and the identity and amount of items
purchased), and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
information related to your payment instruments, such as expiration date and
authentication codes or related information.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You do not have to provide Personal Information to LevelUp, but you may not be able to take
advantage of all features of the Service if you do not.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Financial Information</span>:
In order to use the Service and the LevelUp platform in connection with payments to
merchants, you will need to link a payment instrument, such as a debit or credit card
account number, to your LevelUp User Account ("Financial Information"). LevelUp will only
collect Financial Information from Users using a secure, transparent pass through to our
third-party data vault and payment gateway provider, and LevelUp will never store your
Financial Information itself. LevelUp and its providers maintain compliance with all laws
and rules protecting the privacy of your financial information, including the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Web Tracking Information</span>:
LevelUp and its third-party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as
cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the

</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the type of browser you are using,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In order to collect Web Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more
efficient, we may store cookies on your computer. LevelUp and third party contractors
engaged to provide services on behalf of LevelUp ("Contractors") may also use web tracking
technologies that are placed in web pages on the Service or in email communications to
collect information about actions that users take when they interact with the Service or
such email communications. Web Tracking Information is not correlated by LevelUp to
individual users. Some Web Tracking Information may include data, such as IP address data,
that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser settings to alter which web
tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but this may affect the
performance of the Service.

Please remember that once you grant a third party or Merchant permission to access your
personal information in the LevelUp platform, or you use a link to go from a LevelUp App or
website to another website, LevelUp's Privacy Policy no longer applies, and you will then be
subject to that Merchant's or that website's own rules and policies. You should make
whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any
transaction with any of these third parties or granting permissions for any LevelUp App to
access any of your Personal Information. LevelUp is not responsible for any claims,
