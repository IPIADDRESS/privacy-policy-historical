<h1 class="mbl">Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This privacy policy is designed to inform users of the LevelUp website (www.thelevelup.com),
mobile applications, microsites, software and service (collectively, the “Service”) about how
SCVNGR, Inc., doing business as LevelUp (“LevelUp”, “we” or “us”), gathers and uses personal
information collected by us in connection with use of the Service. LevelUp will take
reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this
policy and with applicable U.S. laws. In this policy, “user” or “you” means any person using
the Service, whether by browsing the LevelUp website or mobile apps, paying for items and/or
transactions using the LevelUp application, engaging in loyalty programs (“Programs”) offered
by LevelUp merchants (each a “Merchant”), or participating in any other activities available
through the Service. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ,
UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF
YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.</p>
<h2>First Up, We Want You to Know This</h2>
<p>We will never disclose your email address to any Merchant or any other third party for their
marketing purposes. This allows you to use LevelUp without receiving a whole lot of direct
marketing you don’t want.</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>Personal Information: LevelUp collects some of your identifying nformation in connection with
the Service. When you sign up to create a LevelUp account (whether through the application,
the website, or Facebook), pay with LevelUp, engage in a Program, submit content to LevelUp,
complete a survey, send us feedback, request information about the Service, apply for a job,
or sign up for special offers from third parties, LevelUp may collect information from you,
such as your email address, first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, date of
birth, location, merchant transaction data, expiration date and authentication codes or
related information (collectively, “Personal Information”). You do not have to provide
Personal Information to LevelUp, but you may not be able to take advantage of all features of
the Service if you do not. Additionally, LevelUp may ask for your credit card number and
banking information, but we will only do so through a transparent pass through, and will never
store such information.</p>
<p>Web Tracking Information: LevelUp and its third party service providers may use web tracking
technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related
to usage of the Service, the Programs and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of
LevelUp. Such data may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you
visited the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address,
what pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on. In order to collect Web
Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store cookies
on your computer. LevelUp and third party contractors engaged to provide services on behalf of
LevelUp (“Contractors”) may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in web pages on
the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions that users take
when they interact with the Service or such email communications. Web Tracking Information is
not correlated by LevelUp to individual users. Some Web Tracking Information may include data,
such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be able to modify your browser
settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted when you use the Service, but
this may affect the performance of the Service.</p>
<h2>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</h2>
