<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information collected by TheModernMan.com via the website located at www.TheModernMan.com.</p>

	fully understand that you may wish to keep your research into the topic of 'women &amp; dating' a private
	matter.</p>
<p><b>Collection and Purpose</b></p>
<p> We may collect personal information from you in the course of your visit to our website if you input
	any personal information into the website. The purpose for which we collect personal information is to
	provide you with the best service experience possible on the website. Some provision of personal

<p>We may also use your e-mail address to contact you in relation to any special promotions or
	events, such as seminars or workshops that may be available in your area.
	c) 'Cookies' from your computer, which enable us to tell when you use our website and also to
	help customise your website experience.
	The use of these 'cookies' enables you to log back into www.TheModernMan.com quickly and
	easily. A cookie is a small information file that is sent to your computer and is stored on your

	which will save you time each time you re-visit www.TheModernMan.com, by remembering
	your email address for you.</p>
<p>You can change the settings on your internet browser to prevent

<p><b>Disclosure</b></p>
<p>We  will use your information to contact you via e-mail.
	The Modern Man does not release your personal information (name, e-mail
	address, mailing address, credit data, etc.) with anyone else. We will never disclose information
	about our customers to third parties except where it is part of operating our website, for billing

	credit and other security checks).</p>
<p><b>Receiving information or products from TheModernMan.com</b></p>
<p>We will never send any item to you to your postal address with "TheModernMan.com" written on it, so
	you won't have to worry about anyone finding out about your dating research. We will only ever send
	you e-mails containing free tips and advice to the e-mail address you provide us with.
	All of the newsletters that are sent to you by The.Modern.Man.com include unsubscribe instructions.
	Therefore, you can remove yourself from our newsletters at any time by simply clicking the unsubscribe

	access, please contact us on the details set out above.</p>
<p><b> Security</b></p>
<p>We have processes in place to ensure the security of your personal information, including encryption
	of all data when it is transferred to our service providers and limitations on access to personal
	information within our organisation.
	We use the highest level of security (up to 256 bit encryption – the level of encryption that banks use)
	to offer totally safe and secure transactions. So, you can rest assured that communications between
	your browser and TheModernMan.com's web servers are private and secure.</p>

<p>The website is not hosted in Australia. For that reason, we transfer all data on the website (including
	all personal information) to our hosting service provider in the United States of America. You hereby
	consent to this transfer.</p>
