        <h3>Collection, Use, Disclosure of Information</h3>
        <p>
            Media Trust does not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you choose to provide us personally
            identifiable information through an online form or e-mail communication or you are accessing client-specific, secure
            content. We may use cookies to ensure authorized access to client-specific secure content. Our use of cookies is explained in
            greater detail below. When accessing client-specific secure content, you are acting as a representative of your company
            and your interactions with our site in this capacity are governed by our relationship agreement with your company.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our site also automatically creates logs regarding your and other user sessions on TheMediaTrust.com, such as features
            that you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you access. We generally use this information in
            statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our site and to better understand your priorities and
            interests.
        </p>
