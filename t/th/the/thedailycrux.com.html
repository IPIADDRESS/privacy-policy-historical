					<p><strong>Last Updated: March 26, 2018</strong></p>
<p>
  Stansberry  &amp; Associates Investment Research, LLC (âStansberry Research,â âweâ, âourâ  and/or âusâ) knows that you care about how information about you is collected,  used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and  sensibly. This notice describes our Privacy Policy, which applies to Stansberry  Research. </p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies  to information we collect from all sources, including in connection with our website  located at <a href="https://stansberryresearch.com/">stansberryresearch.com</a> and any mobile or other  website operated by us (the âWebsitesâ),  the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers  and mobile devices (the âAppsâ),  and our publications, newsletters, memberships, portfolio solutions, webinars, conference calls, e-letters,  blogs, books, electronic communications,  widgets, conferences and events (collectively, the âServicesâ).&nbsp; By providing personal information to us or by using  the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
  This Privacy  Policy is further subject to the Stansberry Research Subscriber Agreement and  Terms of Use (the âAgreementâ) relating to the Services you purchase, use  and/or access. For questions on this Privacy Policy, please contact our  customer service department (âCustomer Serviceâ) by emailing <a href="mailto:info@stansberryresearch.com">info@stansberryresearch.com</a> (any  such request must include âPrivacy Policyâ in the subject line) or by calling  (888) 261-2693 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Please note that your  decision to use the Services and your choice to provide us with your personal  information is voluntary.&nbsp; We indicate the  types of personal information we request in our online, mobile and other  registration forms and in other places where we request such information.&nbsp; You may elect not to submit certain personal information  requested by us, but that election may limit or prevent our ability to provide certain  Services and products to you.</p>
<p>
  <strong>What Personal  Information Do We Collect? </strong></p>
<p>
  Stansberry  Research collects the personal information you enter on our Websites or give us  in any other way, such as via telephone, email, online or otherwise.&nbsp; For example, this information may be  collected when you contact Customer Service for support purposes.&nbsp; We collect this personal information in order  to offer Services you have requested or which we believe are of interest to our  customers, to manage relationships we have with our customers and partners, to  perform activities on your behalf, and for the security of Stansberry Research,  our Websites, Services and customers.&nbsp; The  following describes the types of personal information we collect: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact  Information</strong>: We collect and retain personally identifiable information that  you submit to us voluntarily and this includes, but is not limited to, your  name, postal address (including billing and shipping address), telephone number  and email address. For example, this contact information may be used to  communicate with you with respect to transactions relating to the Services we  provide. Additionally, we may collect contact information provided to us during  any correspondence or telephonic contact relating to Customer Support, as well  as in connection with the Services we offer and the Websites we operate. </li>
<li><strong>Financial  Information:</strong> We collect and retain certain financial information from you,  such as when you order our Services. For example, when you sign up for a Service  that requires a paid subscription, we require you to provide a form of payment  and certain information such as a credit card number and billing address before  we will process that application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial  information collected from you except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as  necessary to fulfill any order for our Services, or as indicated separately at  the point of collection of that information. </li>
<li><strong>Demographic  Information:</strong> We may collect and store demographic information (such as your  zip code, income, gender and age) and use this data to tailor your experience  on our Websites, provide content that we think you might be interested in,  perform general improvements to the Websites, and display the content according  to your preferences. We may also anonymize this demographic data. Such  demographic information may be shared with partners, market researchers and  other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No  personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated  demographic information that is shared with third parties. </li>
<li><strong>Other  Information:</strong> We collect and store certain types of information whenever you  interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of web browser you  are using and the page from which you link. Additionally, we log IP addresses  (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to  improve security, analyze trends and administer the Websites. We may track your  movement within the Websites, the third-party website pages from which you were  referred, access times and browser types. We use this information to gauge the  effectiveness of our Services, track information for statistical purposes and  to improve our Services. We may use such information for marketing purposes,  and to provide you with information we believe might be of interest to you. In  addition, such information may be shared with partners, market researchers and  other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No  personally identifiable information will be linked to such aggregated  information that is shared with third parties. We may supplement the  information you provide us by acquiring publicly or commercially available  information as is available in the public domain or from third parties, such as  data brokers, business partners, payment and delivery services, and advertising  networks, for instance, to verify your address, add a telephone number, or to  update your information and to create a profile of your preferences. We tie  your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in  order to improve the content of the Websites for you or to inform you about Services  that we think may be of interest to you. From time to time, we may also ask you  to participate in surveys or other communications conducted by us or third  parties designed to help us improve the Websites or the Services we provide. </li>
<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> The Websites may use âcookieâ technology for such purposes as enhancing your  online experience by making it easier for you to navigate through the Websites  and making certain features work better. Cookies are text files which are  commonly deposited by websites on a userâs hard drive when the user visits a  website. The file identifies a userâs computer and can record the userâs  preferences and other data about the userâs website visit. Your web browser may  enable you to disable cookies, but please note that certain Services may not function  correctly without it and your experience on our Websites may be reduced. </li>
<li><strong>Third-Party  Advertising Companies:</strong> We may use third-party advertising companies to  serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect and  use information about your visits to this Website and other websites and your  interaction with our Services in order to provide advertisements about Services  that may be of interest to you. However, we do not provide personally  identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address or  telephone number) in connection with third-party advertisements that will be  connected with such information. Such third-party advertising companies may use  information about your visits to this Website and other websites to target  advertisements for our Services and they may keep track of user response to  each advertisement. These targeted advertisements may appear on our Websites or  on other websites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected  through the use of a pixel tag or cookies, which are industry standard  technologies used by most major websites. To learn more about the use of this  information or to choose to not have this information used by certain  third-party advertising partners, please visit the Network Advertising  Initiative at <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</a> or go to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html">https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html</a>.  Please note that if you delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a  new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. </li>
<li><strong>Web  Beacons:</strong> The Websites may contain electronic images (called a âsingle-pixel  GIFâ or a âweb beaconâ) that allow a website to track the effectiveness of  marketing campaigns. No personally identifiable information will be transmitted  via web beacons. </li>
<li><strong>Telephone  Recording and Monitoring:</strong> To ensure that Stansberry Research customers  receive quality service, and for other operational and lawful purposes, we may record  and/or monitor customersâ (and potential customersâ) calls with our employees  or agents.&nbsp; These calls between our  customers (or potential customers) and our employees or agents may be evaluated  by supervisors and/or other Stansberry Research representatives. This is to ensure  that prompt, consistent assistance and accurate information is delivered in a  professional manner and for ongoing compliance purposes. We may also retain and  use such recordings where necessary to protect our business, customers, or  Services, or where required by applicable law. In contacting Stansberry  Research, creating an account with us, or by otherwise utilizing any Service,  you hereby consent to any such call recording and/or monitoring. You should  also note that when our Customer Service representative calls a customer (for  instance, following a request for a return call), these outbound calls may also  be recorded and monitored. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use and Share Personal  Information</strong></p>
<p>
  We receive  and store any personal information you enter on our Websites or give to us  voluntarily in any other way, as well as information that we independently  associate with you through publicly or commercially available sources that are available  in the public domain or from third parties.&nbsp;  We may use your personal information to contact you from time to time.  We may also send you information or offers from time to time to the postal  address or email address we have on file as further described herein.<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your  Email Address: </strong>From time to time, Stansberry Research may use your personal  information to contact you by email concerning our Services. We may also send  you promotional materials regarding offerings from affiliates and  non-affiliated third parties whose services and products we think may be of  interest to you. &nbsp;These email  communications are often intended to inform you of important information  regarding your account, or about general services provided by Stansberry  Research. If you do not want to receive email from us regarding our Services,  please click the âunsubscribeâ link which is included at the bottom of any  email you receive from us. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations  to you, we will continue to send you emails regarding your account  administration, as well as any necessary information, such as renewal notices  and instructions. By providing us with your email address you consent to  receiving communications from us electronically and all notices, disclosures  and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any  legal requirement that such communications be in writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Your  Telephone Number:</strong> By registering on a Website or providing your telephone  number to us through other methods (for instance, during an inquiry you make to  our Customer Service telephone line), you agree that this action constitutes a  purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws.  Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or mobile number may be listed  with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry or your State Do-Not-Call list, you are  providing your express written consent to receive future information (including  telemarketing) about products and services from us, and you hereby agree and  consent to our contacting you using the information you have provided and will  provide to us. This means we may contact you by e-mail, phone and/or mobile  number (including use of automated dialing equipment and/or pre-recorded  calls), text (SMS) message, social networks or any other means of communication  that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of  receiving (i.e., video, etc.).&nbsp; You  further acknowledge that you are not required to agree directly or indirectly  or enter into an agreement regarding our telemarketing efforts as a condition  of purchasing any Services from us.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions: </strong>If you provide your name for a promotional offer, or to enter a sweepstakes  or contest, and you win a prize, we may post a winnerâs list online and/or  offer such a list to those who request it by mail.&nbsp; Your name and city may be listed and we will  file your name with governmental agencies if required by law.</li>
<li><strong>Testimonials and Questions from Customers:</strong>&nbsp; From time to time we may include customersâ  questions (or a summary) and our answers to those questions that we think may  have interest or applicability to others. We will not disclose the customerâs full  name but may use an abbreviated form, such as âJulie K.â&nbsp; Please note that Stansberry Research is a  financial publisher and therefore will not provide any responses that offer  individual, personalized investment-related advice to subscribers, prospective  subscribers or any other type of user.&nbsp;  In addition, we may post  customer testimonials on the Websites, in newsletters, or in other formats. Again,  we will not disclose the customerâs full name but may use an abbreviated form  as described above.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>Third  Parties</strong>: We may provide you with promotional materials regarding offerings  from affiliates and non-affiliated third parties whose services and products we  think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If you  choose to do business with these affiliated or unaffiliated third parties as a  result of such promotions, we may share your personal information with them.&nbsp; These entities may then send you promotional  or administrative communications, by emails or otherwise. If you do not wish to  receive those communications, you should contact these entities directly. &nbsp;If you do not want us to use the information  you provide in order to inform you of products and services we think might  interest you, or do not want us to provide your information to third-party  companies, it is your obligation to let us know by emailing Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@stansberryresearch.com">info@stansberryresearch.com</a> (any  such request must include âPrivacy Policyâ in the subject line) or by calling  (888) 261-2693 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET.</li>
<li><strong>Agents  and Service Providers</strong>: We engage other companies, individuals and  affiliates of Stansberry Research to perform certain functions and/or services for  our customers. Examples may include processing credit card payments, providing  marketing assistance and removing repetitive information from customer lists.  Your contact and financial information may either be collected by or shared  with such third parties as necessary to fulfill these functions and services,  and in some cases, your information may be retained or used by such third parties  to fulfill these functions and services. We contract with service providers to  provide us with data collection and reporting services. When you visit our  Websites, those service providers may collect information on our behalf about  you in order to provide us with aggregated data about our customers and to  assist us in conducting our business and delivering relevant services to our  customers. If you would like to opt-out of the gathering of such information,  you can disable your cookies that assist in the gathering of that data, but  please note that certain services and functions of our Websites may not  function correctly without cookies. </li>
<li><strong>Service-Related  Uses</strong>: We may use your personal information to contact you about the Services  you have purchased, used or otherwise accessed, or for other purposes in which  you have expressed an interest. For example, we will also provide you with  announcements or updates relating to the Services and your account, such as if  the delivery of a Service is delayed.&nbsp; In  such an instance, we may send you an email or other message regarding such  delay. Generally, you may not opt out of these communications, which are not  promotional in nature. </li>
<li><strong>Protection  of Stansberry Research and Others</strong>: We may release account and other personal  information when we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena or  other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, in order to  enforce or apply our Agreement or other agreements, or when we believe in good  faith that disclosing this information is necessary or advisable, including for  example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Stansberry Research, our  customers and users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other  individuals, companies and organizations for fraud protection, credit risk  reduction or other similar purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Terms  and Conditions/Point of Collection:</strong>&nbsp;  We may also disclose information about you as otherwise permitted under  our Agreement or as specifically disclosed when we collect information from you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change in  Business Ownership or Structure</strong> </p>
<p>
  If the ownership of  all or substantially all of Stansberry Researchâs business changes, or we  undertake a corporate reorganization (including, but not limited to, a merger  or consolidation), or a potential sale of some or all of our business or  assets, or there is an event of insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or  pledging of assets, or there is any other action or transfer between or among Stansberry  Research and its affiliates, you expressly consent to Stansberry Research  transferring your information, including your personal information, to the prospective  or actual new owner or successor entity. &nbsp;Also, information about our subscribers  and users, including personal information, may also need to be disclosed in  connection with a commercial transaction seeking financing, investment, support  or funding.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Our Advertising</strong> </p>
<p>
  Our Websites and  Services may contain links to other websites, including those of  advertisers.&nbsp; We are not responsible for  the claims or representations made by advertisers or third parties. We also may  use service providers and other third parties to serve advertisements regarding  goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the  Services and other websites or online services.&nbsp;  This practice is based on information relating to your access to and use  of the Services and other websites or online services on any of your devices,  as well as on information received from third parties.&nbsp; To do so, these  companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including  through the use of pixel tags).&nbsp; They may also use these technologies,  along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across  the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop.&nbsp; If you would  like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in  desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing  this Privacy Policy, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a><u> </u>and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>.&nbsp; You may download the AppChoices  app at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>&nbsp;to opt out in  mobile apps. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Third-Party Services and Websites</strong> </p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy does not address, and Stansberry Research has no  control over or responsibility for, the privacy policies or information  gathering practices of any third party operating any website or providing any  product or service, including those to which we may link and those which may  link to us. The inclusion of a link on our Websites or Services does not imply  endorsement of the linked website or service by us. We strongly recommend that  you review the privacy policies of every online service you use before  submitting any personal information and direct any concerns to the site  administrator of that website.</p>
<p>
  In addition, we are not responsible  for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies or  practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or any  other app developer; app, social media platform, operating system or wireless  service provider; or device manufacturer, including with respect to any  personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in  connection with any of our software applications  made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
  <strong>Limitation  of Liability</strong> </p>
<p>
  STANSBERRY  RESEARCH ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO ANY THEFT, LOSS,  ALTERATION OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL OR OTHER INFORMATION LAWFULLY PROVIDED BY STANSBERRY  RESEARCH TO THIRD PARTIES, OR WITH REGARD TO THE FAILURE OF ANY THIRD PARTY TO  ABIDE BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR SUCH THIRD PARTYâS PRIVACY POLICY OR ANY  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT THIRD PARTY AND STANSBERRY RESEARCH. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Choices and  Opting Out</strong> </p>
<p>
  You may opt out of marketing  communications from us by contacting Customer Support or opting out from the  opt-out link in any marketing email we send to you. We give you choices  regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing  purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  You may opt out from:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Receiving text       alerts from us that you previously opted in to receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;You       can unsubscribe from delivery of our text alerts by following the       instructions in any such text messages.</li>
<li>Our sharing of       your personal information with affiliates or unaffiliated third parties       for their marketing purposes.&nbsp; If you prefer that we not share       your personal information on a going-forward basis with our affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for       their marketing purposes, you may opt out of this sharing by emailing       Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@stansberryresearch.com">info@stansberryresearch.com</a> (any such request must include âPrivacy Policyâ in the subject line) or by       calling (888) 261-2693.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will try to comply  with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp; Please note that  if you opt out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send  you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Accessing  and Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
  Stansberry  Research gives you the ability to access the personal information you have  provided to us for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases,  updating that information. To ensure that the personal information we maintain  about you is accurate and up to date, please inform us immediately of any  changes by emailing Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@stansberryresearch.com">info@stansberryresearch.com</a> (any  such request must include âPrivacy Policyâ in the subject line), by calling  (888) 261-2693&nbsp; between the hours of 9:00  a.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET, or by logging in to your account to make any change in  your personal information. We may retain your information in our files after  you terminate all your Services and/or account with us in order to resolve  disputes, enforce our Agreement, to adhere to the technical and legal  requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation  of the Services and our Websites, and to comply with applicable legal requirements  such as court orders, subpoenas and other service of process. Stansberry  Research will maintain your personal information for as long as it deems  necessary in its sole discretion, or as required by applicable laws,  regulations, or government orders. Current and former customers may request  this information by emailing Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@stansberryresearch.com">info@stansberryresearch.com</a> (any  such request must include âPrivacy Policyâ in the subject line) or calling (888)  261-2693 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. ET. We will try to comply  with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note, however, that  no financial information will be provided over the phone, and in no event will  such information be provided without verification. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Data  Security and Integrity</strong></p>
<p>
  Stansberry Research  has reasonable security policies and procedures in place to protect personal  information within our organization from unauthorized loss, misuse, alteration  or destruction. Unfortunately, security cannot be absolutely guaranteed against  all threats. Please be advised that we may use third-party cloud service  providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to  standard terms and conditions that may be non-negotiable; these service  providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security  measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their  systems, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures. You can further help to ensure your  security by taking a few simple precautions. Do not include any personal  information in any username or password or in any chat group or message board  that you access through the Services. In addition, in order to protect against  unauthorized access to your computer and to any Stansberry Research username  and password, you should sign off when you are finished using a shared computer,  and not share your Stansberry Research username and password. If you have reason to believe that your interaction  with us is no longer secure, you are required to notify us in accordance with  the&nbsp;âContacting Usâ&nbsp;section  below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
  <strong>Cross-Border Transfer</strong></p>
<p>
  Our online  services are U.S.-based and are controlled, operated and administered by Stanberry  Research from its offices within the United States, and are made available to  you on an unsolicited basis, without any marketing or promotion by Stansberry  Research regarding these online services to persons or entities outside the U.S.  This Privacy Policy is provided in accordance with and subject to applicable  U.S. law. If you decide to continue to access our online services from your  location outside the U.S., you hereby agree that your use of those services is  subject to this Privacy Policy and your personal information will be  transferred or processed in the United States.&nbsp;  &nbsp; </p>
<p>
  <strong>Use of Services by Minors </strong></p>
<p>
  The Services  and the Websites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13).  Stansberry Research does not knowingly collect personal information from such  individuals and we request that they not provide personal information through  the Services or the Websites. If we learn that we have collected or received  personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental  consent, we will delete that information.
