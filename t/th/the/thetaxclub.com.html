                        Sites, our servers log your IP address. </span></p>
														<p><span class="body">"Web beacons": A Web beacon, or

                        information about a user. </span></p>
														<p><span class="body">Non-personal identification 
                        information might include the browser you use, the type

                        users as a group use the services and resources provided 
                        on our Sites. This way we know which areas of our Sites 
                        are favorites of our users, which areas need 
                        improvement, and what technologies are being used so

                        individual names, personal navigational or other 
                        personal information. For example, we may use a 
                        third-party advertising company to serve ads when you 
                        visit our Sites. We may share demographic and preference 
                        information with this company to allow them to display

                        server to display ads on our Sites. In addition,

                        companies to serve ads onto our Sites. Some of our

                        (ii) track user behavior within our Sites. Advertisers 
                        generally use such information to customize the display 
                        of ads within our Sites. We will not permit such 
                        advertisers to collect any personal information from our 
                        users within our Sites, however, you may choose to 
                        voluntarily provide the advertisers with your personal

                        any information that they may contain. </span></p>
														<p><span class="body">Further, we may contract with a 
                        third party web analytics provider to help manage and 
                        optimize our Sites. We may use this service to help us 
                        measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how 
                        visitors use our Sites. To do this, we may use Web 
                        beacons and cookie technology on the Sites. The type of 
                        information we may collect includes the number of hits a 
                        webpage receives, type of browser used, and number of 
                        times a visitor makes a purchase from a particular 
                        promotion. By supplementing our records, this 
                        information helps us learn things like what pages are 
                        most attractive to our visitors, which of our products 
                        and services most interest our users, and what kinds of 
                        offers our users like to see. Although this third-party 
                        provider logs the information coming from our Sites on 
                        our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be
