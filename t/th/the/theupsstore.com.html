		<span class="sectionheader">Personal Information Collected and How It Is Used</span><br>
		Personally identifiable information is information that allows you to be identified or contacted individually. This web site does not collect any personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it.<br>
		<br>
		Personally identifiable information may be collected when you complete any online form, application, survey or request for information. Therefore, if you do not wish for us to obtain your personally identifiable information, please do not submit it to us. You will be informed at the time you provide personally identifiable information whether the information is required or optional.<br>
		<br>
		Below we describe how the personally identifiable information collected at each visitor interface on this web site is used by us. We do not sell or rent information collected on this web site, and do not disclose the information collected on this web site to third parties except to act upon your requests or queries as described in this section, or as described in Information Sharing and Disclosure.<br>
		<br>
		From time to time, we may collect personally identifiable information other than as described below, but it will be obvious to you that we are collecting such information (e.g., through use of surveys). If we collect additional personally identifiable information in a manner that is not apparent, we will provide you with notice as described in Changes to the Privacy Policy<br>
		<br>
		<span class="sectionsubheader">Applicants for Franchises</span><br>
		<br>
		<span class="bold">Domestic Franchises</span><br>
		Within the U.S., we are accepting applications for The UPS StoreSM franchises only.  If you are interested in becoming a domestic The UPS Store franchisee, you may complete and submit on-line forms requesting more information about franchising opportunities from us or make an on-line application for a domestic franchise. These forms require you to submit personally identifiable information such as your name, address, contact information, as well as information relevant to your ability to purchase a franchise. If you have co-applicant, similar information may be required from him or her.<br>
		<br>
		<span class="bold">International Franchises</span><br>
		If you wish to pursue a franchise opportunity outside the U.S., you may complete and submit a Mail Boxes Etc. International Franchise Request Form. This form requires that you provide personally identifiable information including your name, address, contact information, and other information relevant to an assessment of your application for a Mail Boxes Etc. franchise. You will also be required to identify any corporation or partner participating in your application for a Mail Boxes Etc. franchise, and the country or countries for which you are interested in franchise opportunities.<br>
		<br>
		The personally identifiable information collected from potential franchisees (and any subsequently gathered by us and our agents in acting on a submission) is used by us to assess and act upon your application to become our franchisee. In the case of domestic applications, the information may be shared with our area franchisees who render sales support and other assistance to us. In the case of international applications, if your submission indicates an interest in an individual or multiple-unit franchise, your information may be shared with our Master Franchisee for the applicable territory. In either case, the information will be used for purposes of assessing or acting on your application. MBE, its area franchisee or its Master Franchisee may contact you about franchising opportunities with us by means of mail, e-mail, or phone.<br>
