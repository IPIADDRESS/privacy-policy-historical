<ul>
    <li><strong>Compliance  with legal obligations</strong>: As an entity established under the laws of England  and Wales, The Jockey Club is obliged to comply with UK laws and guidance  provided by UK regulatory bodies. In particular, we will need to process your  personal information to verify your identity, in some circumstances establish  your age, establish your source of funds for anti-money laundering,  anti-terrorism and fraud purposes, and to establish whether you have been  barred from any of our venues or from using our Site due to objectionable  behaviour. You will not be able to object to processing or ask for the deletion  of your personal information insofar as it falls under this category. </li>
    <li><strong>Necessary  for the entry into / performance of a contract</strong>: When you enter into a  transaction with us, a contract between you and us will have been entered into.  In order for us to fulfil our obligations under such contract (e.g. to allow  you to purchase a ticket or membership from us), we will need to collect and  process your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal  information on sign-up and financial information on entering into the  transaction or objecting to this type of processing / exercising your deletion  rights will unfortunately mean we cannot provide our goods / services to you. </li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong>:&nbsp;  We may send you electronic marketing messages about us and our venues, events  and offers where you have not unsubscribed and where you have purchased tickets  to our venues or events or bought goods or other services from us. We provide  easy ways to stop our marketing, and you can opt out at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not a customer of ours but  have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then  we may also contact you about our events, goods and services.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
If you have confirmed that you would  like to hear from us about other party’s goods and services then we will use  your details to contact you with marketing information about such party's goods  and services. &nbsp;<br>
If you have confirmed that you would  like to hear directly from a third party (including other members of our Group)  about such party’s goods and services then we will share your details with such  third party so they can contact you about their goods and services. <br>
In each of the situations above, you  have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can object to  processing of this nature. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Legitimate</strong> <strong>interests</strong>:&nbsp; To use your personal data for any other  purpose described in this Privacy Policy, we will rely on a condition known as  "legitimate interests".&nbsp; It is  in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us  with the information that we need to provide our services to you more effectively  and to manage our business. Effectively, this requires us to carry out a  balancing test of our interests in using your personal data (for example, in  order to provide you with the information, products and services that you  request from us), against the interests you have as a citizen and the rights you  have under data protection laws (for example, to not have your data sold to  third party marketing companies without your knowledge, or not store your  personal data in insecure or unstable countries or regions). As a result of our  balancing test, which is detailed below, we have determined, acting reasonably  and considering the circumstances, that we are able to process your personal  data in accordance with the data protection laws on the basis that we have a  legitimate business interest.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>We have a legitimate interest in processing your  personal data as: (a) We need the information to respond to your enquiries (and  where relevant process your CV/ job application); (b) We need the information  to be able to send you information; and (c) We would be unable to provide our  products and/or services without processing your information.</li>
        <li>Necessity: We consider that it is reasonable for  us to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests  outlined above as we process your personal data only so far as is necessary for  such purpose.</li>
        <li>Impact: We consider that it is reasonable for us  to process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests  outlined above as it can be reasonably expected for us to process your personal  information in this way for the purposes set out above. In most cases the  information is being processed for your benefit as well as ours.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR  INFORMATION FOR</strong><br>
When your  data is no longer required for the purposes listed above, we will delete it  within the periods set out below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where a customer has purchased a product or  service .eg. a ticket, marketing consents will be refreshed after 5 years and  data deleted after a further period of 12 months;</li>
    <li>We may keep your personal information beyond 7  years, in transactional platforms to maintain transactional record completeness  to enable us to retain the information we may require for legal , regulatory  and anti-fraud purposes.</li>
    <li>Where a subscriber (being an individual who has  not purchased a ticket, but has subscribed to marketing), marketing consents  will be refreshed after 24 months and data deleted after a further period of 12  months.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Marketing emails and other communications where  possible will typically be deleted after 5 years ;&nbsp; </li>

    <li>Where we store  your personal data</li>
</ul>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and  stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA")</strong>. &nbsp;It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us,  our Group or for one of our suppliers.&nbsp;  This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the provision of  support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that  your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure  servers, or those of our suppliers.&nbsp;  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which  enables you to access certain parts of our Site, App or Wi-Fi, you are  responsible for keeping this password confidential.&nbsp; We ask you not <a name="_BPDCI_112">to </a>share <a name="_BPDCD_113">a </a>password with anyone.</p>
