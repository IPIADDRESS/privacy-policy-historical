Even if both sender and recipient are located in the same country, information sent via the internet may be transmitted across international borders and be forwarded to a country with a lower data protection level than the one existing in your country of residence. Please note that we accept no responsibility for the security of your information whilst in transit over the internet to the-medium-maria.com.<br>
<h3>
<br>
What legal basis do we rely upon to process your personal data?</h3>
We may process your personal data on the basis of: (i) your consent, (ii) the necessity for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract and/or (iii) our legitimate interests (specifically, getting to know your preferences so as to enable us to personalize our offers and, ultimately, offer products and services that better meet your needs and desires and providing you with offers of products and services which you may be interested in), where applicable.<br>

Mediaweb Limited uses tracking technology such as cookies or tags to gather such information as outlined above (see "<a href="/privacy_policy.html/#info">What information is collected</a>" and "<a href="/privacy_policy.html/#share">How do we share your personal data</a>") and to understand how visitors use the the-medium-maria.com website. Tracking technology helps us manage and improve the usability of the the-medium-maria.com website, for example by determining whether there has been any contact between your computer's IP address and us in the past and identifying the most popular sections of the the-medium-maria.com website. In concrete terms, the-medium-maria.com's server sends information to your computer, mobile phone or other electronic device which is then stored on your hard drive.

<br>
Cookies are pieces of data (small electronic text files) stored on your device/terminal equipment that contain data about a user or its device. They allow the storage of information for a determinate period of time and the identification of the user's electronic device.<br>
<br>

If you continue to actively use the website and do not actively object to the use of cookies, you agree to our use of cookies and your IP address and such consent will be stored in your browser, so that the information does not have to be repeated on every page of the website.

<br>
In order to render the services, we install and use certain technically required cookies which therefore do not require your prior consent. We also use session cookies which are automatically deleted at the end of your session and which also do not require your prior consent.

We use analytics cookies to gather general information on how users use the services and the website, e.g. which pages they visit most frequently and whether they receive any error messages from websites. These cookies do not collect any data that may lead to an identification of the user. All information collected with the aid of such cookies exclusively serves the purpose to comprehend and improve the functionality of our services and website. We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").

Some of our pages may also contain web beacons which allow us to collect information on the volume and origin of visitor traffic to our pages as well as general demographic information about these visitors. This data is stored anonymously, it does not contain any personal information and can thus be disclosed to third parties, particularly for information or statistical analysis purposes, particularly in order to analyze the performance of our marketing promotions.<br>
<br>
We may also use advertising cookies to collect certain demographics and usage statistics to improve the services. In particular, we use the following Google Analytics Advertising Features: Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting; Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.<br>
<br>
We also make use of "social plugins", i.e. plugins for social networks, including particularly the Facebook "Share" button. The facebook.com website is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The plug-ins usually feature the Facebook logo. Besides Facebook, we use plug-ins by Twitter (provider: Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA), Pinterest (provider: Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (if you are located in the USA), Pinterest Europe Ltd., Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland (if you are located outside the USA), Instagram (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA) and GooglePlus (provider: Google).<br>
<br>
For data privacy reasons, we deliberately opted against utilizing direct social network plug-ins on our website. Instead, we employ an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit the website, data are never automatically transmitted to social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the respective social network, i.e. clicking on elements then clicking on the social network's icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the respective social network and sending usage data to that social network operator, whether or not you are a subscriber of such social network.<br>
<br>
We have no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather. For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networks' respective data privacy advisories.<br>
