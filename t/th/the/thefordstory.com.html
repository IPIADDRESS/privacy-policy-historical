All information on our site is free to browse at your leisure without the need for you to provide us with any personally identifiable information. Thefordstory.com collects other information, non-personally identifiable information from site visitors. This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors.

An explanation for each of these items and how they work is included in the section, Methods We Use to Collect Information.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect:</strong></p>
<p>Non-Personally identifiable information collected on thefordstory.com may be used to:<br>
• Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in website design and to identify popular features<br>
• Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet user wants and needs</p>
<p>thefordstory.com utilizes session log data and your personal and non-personal data for the purpose of performing analytics on the users’ experience while visiting this site. This analysis:<br>
• Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your information personally<br>

<p><strong>Methods We Use to Collect Information</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire,) they are overwritten with newer cookies, c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.</p>
<p>Thefordstory.com may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.</p>
<p>When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a “session log.” We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.</p>
<p>Users may be directed to thefordstory.com via banner ads or site links. Ads or site links that are placed by thefordstory.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personal information from the user.</p>
