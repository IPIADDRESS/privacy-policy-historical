				<h1><a href="#Privacy">New Privacy Statement Effective January 1, 2014</a></h1>
<p><strong>The Effective Date of this Privacy Statement is May 1, 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Privacy Pledge</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.  General Statement:</span></strong></p>
<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.  This privacy statement explains our policies and practices regarding online customer information.  It is through this disclosure that we intend to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, and safeguard personal and other information we collect or that you provide through this website, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.  Information About Our Organization and Website:</span></strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to <a href="http://social.ford.com/">http://social.ford.com/</a> and to certain pages on this site that are linked/overlayed on certain Ford social media sites such as Facebook pages (which may appear as apps) and link to or reference this Privacy Statement (herein referenced as “social.ford.com,” “site,” or “website”).  social.ford.com is owned by Ford Motor Company, Marketing, Sales and Service Division, 16800 Executive Plaza Drive, Dearborn, MI 48126.</p>
<p>The business purpose of this website is to provide: (1) visitors with Ford’s perspective on news and current events relevant to Ford Motor Company, its employees and its customers; (2) samples of what others are saying about Ford Motor Company, and its products; and (3) customers with a place to post their opinions, stories, and photos, and to obtain, share and download badges.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.  Personally Identifiable Information We Collect From You:</span></strong></p>
<p>When you visit social.ford.com we will not collect any personal information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily.  Personal data includes information that is particular to you such as name, street address, telephone number, and email address.  If you opt not to provide us with personal information you can still access our website, however you may be unable to join Ford Social, create log in credentials, select certain badges, participate in certain promotions, set preferences to automatically share what you have read, videos watched or photo’s viewed on Facebook,<strong> </strong>or receive product information.</p>
<p>Some site functionalities require you to provide your personal information such as when you create a profile and log in credentials, provide comments or upload photos.  Instead of having to type in all of your personal information, some of these functionalities may allow you to utilize third-party authentication tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google to populate certain fields.  In addition, certain pages of this website may appear as overlays on social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Google+ and others). This will allow for integration with those sites, some of which may require you to allow Ford to access your personal information or other information you have made public. By authenticating through one of the social media options or utilizing available applications overlayed on and integrated with social media sites, you allow us to receive your personal and other information that is accessible.  For the tool you chose to utilize, we encourage you to review the tool provider’s privacy policy and any terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you when you visit social.ford.com is to provide you the functionality and services that you need to have a meaningful and customized experience while using the site features.</p>
<p>This site may use session or persistent “cookies” to collect personally identifiable information in order to verify log in credentials.  An explanation for each of these items and how they work is included in Section 7 – Methods to Collect Information.</p>

<p>social.ford.com collects other information, non-personally identifiable information from site visitors.  This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors.  Non-personal information includes tracking the site pages that are visited or the amount of time spent on our site.</p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting aggregate information from you is to be able to perform site metrics that allow us to improve the functionality of the website.  We need to collect aggregate information in order to track page visits and peak site usage times, and to perform site clickthrough analysis and site layout re-design.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you visit this site using a mobile device, we collect additional non-personal information which may include the type/model of the mobile device viewing the site, the mobile device’s service provider and operating system.</p>
<p>We may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, banner ads or links, and third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as DART, Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, and Google Analytics) to collect aggregate or other non-personally identifiable information about site visitors.  An explanation for each of these items and how they work is included in Section 7 – Methods to Collect Information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.  How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect:</span></strong></p>
<p>Non-Personally identifiable information collected on social.ford.com may be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in website design and to identify popular features</li>
<li>Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet user wants and needs</li>
<li>Make the user experience more customer friendly</li>
</ul>
<p>social.ford.com utilizes non-personal data for the purpose of performing analytics on the user’s experience while visiting this site. This analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your information personally</li>
<li>May involve the use of a third-party vendor acting on behalf of social.ford.com</li>
<li>Is performed in order to improve our website and the user experience</li>
<li>May include the use of session and/or persistent cookies to track user movement across this and other Ford Motor Company websites or to track other events within or across this and other Ford Motor Company websites</li>
<li>Third-party vendors with which Ford has entered into contracts to perform site analytics and which are provided aggregate information covered by this privacy statement are to use that information only to perform those services, and they may not share or resell this information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.  Methods to Collect Information:</span></strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.  There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them.  Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.</p>
<p>This site may use third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as DART, Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, and Google Analytics) to capture clickthrough statistics.</p>
<p>social.ford.com may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times.  Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address.  In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.</p>
<p>When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a “session log.”  We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used.  The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Users may be directed to social.ford.com via banner ads, site links or QR codes.  Ads, site links or QR codes that are placed by social.ford.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads, links or QR codes.  They do not collect personal information from the user.</p>
<p>If you visit this site with an open ID, you may integrate with third-party social media sites, and social.ford.com may track on an aggregate level the number of visits to this site with an open ID, the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising.</span> On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day).  We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners.  These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-Ford) sites within their networks.  This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.”</p>
<p>Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices on the page.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting out (site pages</span>). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s).  Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting out (advertisements)</span>.<strong> </strong>Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy statement may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.  These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.  Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt-out Compliance Service</span>.  This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info</a>).  When you opt-out on site pages or through such advertisements, Evidon conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt out) indicating that you have opted out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again.  The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time.  To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement applies to <a href="http://social.ford.com/">http://social.ford.com/</a> and to certain pages on this site that are linked/overlayed on certain Ford social media sites such as Facebook pages (which may appear as apps) and link to or reference this Privacy Statement (herein referenced as “social.ford.com,” “site,” or “website”).&nbsp; social.ford.com is owned by Ford Motor Company, Marketing, Sales and Service Division, 16800 Executive Plaza Drive, Dearborn, MI 48126.</p>

<p><strong>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies, Ford Motor Company does not currently respond to undefined “DNT” signals to its US websites. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some functions or services on our sites.</strong></p>

<p>When you visit social.ford.com we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily.&nbsp; For purposes of this Privacy Statement “personally identifiable information” is information that identifies you as an individual, for example your name, street address, telephone number, and email address.&nbsp; If you opt not to provide us with personally identifiable information you can still access our website, however you may be unable to join Ford Social, create log in credentials, select certain badges, participate in certain promotions, set preferences to automatically share what you have read, videos watched or photo’s viewed on Facebook,<strong> </strong>or receive product information.</p>
<p>Some site functionalities require you to provide your personally identifiable information such as when you create a profile and log in credentials, provide comments or upload photos.&nbsp; Instead of having to type in all of your personally identifiable information, some of these functionalities may allow you to utilize third-party authentication tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google to populate certain fields.&nbsp; In addition, certain pages of this website may appear as overlays on social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Google+ and others). This will allow for integration with those sites, some of which may require you to allow Ford to access your personally identifiable information or other information you have made public. By authenticating through one of the social media options or utilizing available applications overlayed on and integrated with social media sites, you allow us to receive your information that is accessible.&nbsp; For the tool you chose to utilize, we encourage you to review the tool provider’s privacy policy and any terms and conditions.</p>

<p>social.ford.com collects other “non-personally identifiable information” from site visitors.&nbsp; This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors.&nbsp; Non-personally identifiable information includes tracking the site pages that are visited or the amount of time spent on our site.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.&nbsp; Methods to Collect Information:</span></strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.&nbsp; There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them.&nbsp; Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.</p>
<p>This site may use third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Adobe and Google Analytics) to capture clickthrough statistics.</p>
<p>social.ford.com may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. &nbsp;Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. &nbsp;In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.</p>
<p>When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a “session log.”&nbsp; We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used.&nbsp; The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personally identifiable information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Users may be directed to social.ford.com via banner ads, site links or QR codes.&nbsp; Ads, site links or QR codes that are placed by social.ford.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads, links or QR codes.&nbsp; They do not collect personally identifiable information from the user.</p>
<p>If you visit this site with an open ID, you may integrate with third-party social media sites, and social.ford.com may track on an aggregate level the number of visits to this site with an open ID, the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising.</span> On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day).&nbsp; We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners.&nbsp; These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-Ford) sites within their networks.&nbsp; This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.”</p>
<p>Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices on the page.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting out (site pages</span>). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s).&nbsp; Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting out (advertisements)</span>.<strong> </strong>Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy statement may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.&nbsp; These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.&nbsp; Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt-out Compliance Service</span>.&nbsp; This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info</a>).&nbsp; When you opt-out on site pages or through such advertisements, Evidon conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt out) indicating that you have opted out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again.&nbsp; The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time.&nbsp; To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
