The Knot logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as America Online or Yahoo!.) This information (in aggregate form) is recorded for administrative purposes only; IP addresses are not linked to any personal information. </p><p>The Knot uses a cookie, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our site to your preferences. For example, The Knot uses a cookie to identify you as a Knot member, and to make sure that only you have access to (for example) your own personal wedding budget and calendar. This way, you only have to answer those questions once and not every time you participate in an activity or event. The cookie, by itself, doesn't tell us (or anyone else) who you are, your e-mail address, or anything else personal. You provide that information when you register with The Knot, and only The Knot has access to that information. </p><p>For more information on cookies, please see our <a href="me_faq.html">Cookie FAQ</a>. </p><p>You can browse The Knot and read our editorial content without registering or providing any personal information. However, in order to take advantage of our personalized services, you are required to provide us with personal information such as your name, email address, real-world address, wedding date and role in the wedding. (We always let you know before we collect any personal information from you.) We collect similar information from users who choose to participate in our contests and promotional events. </p><p>What do we do with the information that we collect? </p><p>The information we collect from your membership helps us to improve our content, customize content of certain pages for you, and to send you updates about The Knot. The Knot does share names, postal addresses and demographic information with other pre-screened organizations who have specific direct mail product and service offers we think may be of interest to you.  However, you may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provide to these other companies.  </p><p>To edit your privacy preferences, <a href="PL_profile1.html?pagefrom=me_privacy.html">click here</a>. </p><p>Finally, The Knot contains links to some other web sites. We cannot be responsible for the content of those sites or for the privacy of information that you may choose to share with them.</p><p> <br><br> <font face="arial" size="1" color="#6699CC"><span class="bodycopy" style="color:#69C;"><a href="au_mission.html"><font color="#6699CC">About Us</font></a> | <a href="mailto:feedback@theknot.com"><font color="#6699CC">Feedback</font></a> | <a href="defaultfr.asp" target="_top"><font color="#6699CC">Home</font></a> | <a href="au_contactus.html"><font color="#6699CC">Contact Us</font></a><br>&nbsp;</span></font></p></font></td> </tr> </tbody></table>   <map name="logo"> <area shape="RECT" coords="0,0,159,46" href="defaultfr.asp" target="_top"> <area shape="RECT" coords="159,0,640,46" href="au_mission.html"> </map> <map name="TOPNAV"> <area shape="RECT" coords="0,0,63,24" href="au_thebrand.html"> <area shape="RECT" coords="64,0,141,24" href="au_thecompany.html"> <area shape="RECT" coords="143,0,200,24" href="au_pressquotes1.html"> <area shape="RECT" coords="202,0,309,24" href="investor_relations"> <area shape="RECT" coords="311,0,380,24" href="au_contactus.html"> <area shape="RECT" coords="382,0,420,24" href="default.htm" target="_top"> </map>
