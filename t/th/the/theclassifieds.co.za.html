<h1>Privacy Policy - TheClassifieds</h1>
<p>Last updated on: 21 January 2010</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>1.1 </strong>TheClassifieds recognises the importance of protecting the personal information that you ("the User") provide to us. Therefore, we have put together, and endevour to follow this policy that respects and addresses that.
</p><h2>2. Information collection</h2>
<p><strong>2.1 </strong>TheClassifieds collects information from the User at several different points on the Site.

We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.
</p><p><strong>2.2 </strong>Consent to collect information can be express (eg. signing an agreement) or implied (eg. if the User is given an opportunity to opt-out of a specific form of information sharing, but chooses not to do so, TheClassifieds implies that the User chooses to share this information with us).
</p><p><strong>2.3 </strong>TheClassifieds processes personal information on web hosting servers which may not be in your present country.
</p><h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
<p><strong>3.1 </strong>In the course of service provision to the User we may collect certain forms of information. The types of information that we may collect are detailed below:
</p><li><strong>3.1.1 </strong>Information you provide - When you place a classified on TheClassifieds by completing the appropriate form, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and phone number). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our service.
</li><li><strong>3.1.2 </strong>Cookies - When you visit TheClassifieds, we may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences or storing session information. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, this is not advised as some features (and indeed our service itself) may not function correctly if your cookies are disabled.
</li><li><strong>3.1.3 </strong>Log information - When you use TheClassifieds, our server automatically records information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
</li><li><strong>3.1.4 </strong>User communications - When you send email or other commun3.1.2 ication to TheClassifieds, we may retain those communications in order to process your enquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
</li><li><strong>3.1.5 </strong>Links - TheClassifieds may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and who followed them, either on the web site or in electronic communications. We use this information to improve the quality of our service, customized content and advertising.
</li><li><strong>3.1.6 </strong>Other sites - This Privacy Policy only applies to TheClassifieds. We do not exercise control over any third party sites who we have partnered with to deliver a service to you.
