				<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
				<i><span class="smallText"><b>Effective date:</b> This policy was last updated November 2006.</span></i><br><br>
				At Thermo Fisher Scientific, we take your privacy seriously. In general, you can visit Thermo Fisher Scientific on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with Thermo Fisher Scientific.<br><br>
				Thermo Fisher Scientific provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.<br><br>
				Within the Thermo Fisher Scientific web site, you can order products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages may include your name, your company name, address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, contact and billing information (including shipping address and end-user), transaction, and/or credit card information.<br><br>
				In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding the analytical instrumentation in your laboratory, industry, experience with our products, and contact preferences.<br><br>
				When information is collected from you, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use it - typically only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request or to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on services and benefits, and to personalize our web site for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.<br><br>
				However, we may need to share your information with our subsidiaries or with other companies that we have hired to provide the services that you requested. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the option of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact.<br><br>
				Thermo Fisher Scientific will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the uses described above. Thermo Fisher Scientific will make every effort to apply local country laws and policies where they differ from those in the United States, if any.<br><br>
				Thermo Fisher Scientific is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. For example, we use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.<br><br>
				Thermo Fisher Scientific's web site may contain links to other sites; such as, Thermo Fisher Scientific distributors and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites. You are solely responsible for evaluating the privacy practices employed by those sites.<br><br>
				If you have comments or questions about our privacy policy, please visit the contact us page, select "contact your service rep" and then select "other" from the list of subject areas. An e-mail will be dispatched to a member of the Thermo Fisher Scientific staff, and someone will respond to you shortly.<br><br>
				Please check this privacy policy periodically to inform yourself of any changes. We reserve the right to modify or supplement this privacy policy from time to time without notice to you.</td>
