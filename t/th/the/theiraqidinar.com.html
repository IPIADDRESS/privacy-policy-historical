<h3><a id="information" name="information"></a>Information we collect and how we use
it</h3>
<p>We may collect the following types of information: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information you provide – When you sign up for a Dinar
	Daddy's Tidbits Account, we ask you for personal information. We may
	combine the information you submit under your account with
	information from other Dinar Daddy's Tidbits services or third
	parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to
	improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may
	give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.
	You can use the Dinar Daddy's Tidbits Dashboard to learn more about
	the information associated with your Account. If you are using Dinar

	your email. Consult your domain administrator’s privacy policy for
	more information. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Cookies – When you visit Dinar Daddy's Tidbits, we send one
	or more cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to
	improve the quality of our service, including for storing user
	preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking
	user trends, such as how people search. Dinar Daddy's Tidbits also
	uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers and
	publishers serve and manage ads across the web and on Dinar Daddy's
	Tidbits services. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Log information – When you access Dinar Daddy's Tidbits
	services, our servers automatically record information that your
	browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may
	include information such as your web request, your interaction with
	a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser
	language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies
	that may uniquely identify your browser or your account. </p></li>
<li>
<p>User communications – When you send email or other
	communications to Dinar Daddy's Tidbits, we may retain those
	communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your
	requests and improve our services. When you send and receive SMS
	messages to or from one of our services that provides SMS
	functionality, we may collect and maintain information associated
	with those messages, such as the phone number, the wireless carrier
	associated with the phone number, the content of the message, and

	receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals
	sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to
	approximate a location (such as a cell ID). </p></li>
<li>
<p>Unique application number – Certain services, such as Dinar
	Daddy's Tidbits Toolbar, include a unique application number that is
	not associated with your account or you. This number and information
	about your installation (e.g., operating system type, version
	number) may be sent to Dinar Daddy's Tidbits when you install or
	uninstall that service, when that service periodically contacts our
	servers (for example, to request automatic updates to the software).</p></li>
<li>
<p>Other sites – This Privacy Policy applies to Dinar Daddy's
	Tidbits services only. We do not exercise control over the sites
	displayed as search results, sites that include Dinar Daddy's
	Tidbits applications, products or services, or links from within our
	various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or
	other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal
	information from you. </p></li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect
to: </p>
<ul>

	(including advertising services) and develop new services; and </p></li>
<li>
<p>Protect the rights or property of Dinar Daddy's Tidbits or
	our users. </p></li></ul>
<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose
for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior
to such use. </p>
<p>Dinar Daddy's Tidbits processes personal information on our
servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In
some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.</p>
<h3><a id="infochoices" name="infochoices"></a>Choices</h3>

control the information stored in your Dinar Daddy's Tidbits Account.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
is being sent. However, some Dinar Daddy's Tidbits features and
services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. </p>
<p>Dinar Daddy's Tidbits uses the&nbsp;DoubleClick advertising cookie
on AdSense partner sites and certain Dinar Daddy's Tidbits services
to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the
web. You can view and manage your ads preferences associated with

<h3><a id="infosharing" name="infosharing"></a>Information sharing</h3>
<p>Dinar Daddy's Tidbits only shares personal information with other
companies or individuals outside of Dinar Daddy's Tidbits in the
following limited circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the
	sharing of any sensitive personal information. </p></li>
<li>
<p>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
	companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of
	processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these
	parties agree to process such information based on our instructions
	and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
	confidentiality and security measures. </p></li>
<li>
<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
	disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a)
	satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
	governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service,
	including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,
	prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,
	or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of
	Dinar Daddy's Tidbits, its users or the public as required or
	permitted by law. </p></li></ul>
<p>If Dinar Daddy's Tidbits becomes involved in a merger,
acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we
will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved
in such transactions and provide notice before personal information
is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
<h3><a id="infosecurity" name="infosecurity"></a>Information security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against
unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to
guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal
data. </p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Dinar Daddy's
Tidbits employees, contractors and agents who need to know that
information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals
are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to
discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
fail to meet these obligations. </p>
<h3><a id="access" name="access"></a>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<p>When you use Dinar Daddy's Tidbits services, we make good faith
efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and
either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such
data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained
by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users
to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may
decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the
privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance,
requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for
which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide
information access and correction, we perform this service free of
charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete
your information, residual copies may take a period of time before
they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup
systems. Please review the service Help Centers for more information.</p>
