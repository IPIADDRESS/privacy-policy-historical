Unilever may use cookies to collect other information during your visit to our web site, such as the particular site areas you visit and the products or services you buy through our web site. We collect this information to better tailor our site and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our sites. For example, a site can recognize that you have provided Personal Information to us and refrain from requesting the same information a second time. </p>
        <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

Information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using may also be collected and linked to your Personal Information. This is to ensure that our web sites present the best web experience for visitors, and that they are an effective information resource. </p>

        <ul><li>If your child provides us with online contact information (e.g., an e-mail address) solely so that we may respond more than once to a specific request (e.g., sending an on-line newsletter) and for no other purpose, then we will notify you via e-mail that this information has been provided to us. You have the right, as will be outlined in our notification and as set forth below (see <a href="#who">Who to Contact</a>), to ask that we not use your child's online contact information for this purpose. </li></ul>
        <ul><li> Before your child provides us with Personal Information beyond online contact information (e.g., a street address, phone number, etc.), or if we wish to use Personal Information for purposes other than responding more than once to a specific request, then we will contact you by e-mail and will require your signed permission, sent by real world mail, before we collect and use such information.  </li></ul>
        <ul><li>If the information provided by your child is online contact information only (e.g., an e-mail address), and it is to be used to respond on a one-time basis to a specific request (e.g., to answer a question about one of our products), and thereafter it is deleted from our records, then we will not notify you.</li></ul>
