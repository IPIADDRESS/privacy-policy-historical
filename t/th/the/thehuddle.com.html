                  <p><b>Traffic Data</b><br>
                    Each time a visitor comes to Our Sites, the servers -- like 
                    most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information. 
                    Examples of this basic information include the visitor's domain 
                    name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or 
                    earthlink.net), referral data (e.g., we record the address 
                    of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to 
                    Our Sites) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape 
                    browser on a Macintosh platform).</p>
                  <p>We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity 
                    into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites. As 
                    a result we may merge information about visitors and visits 
                    into group data, which may then be used for internal research 
                    and analysis. We will not disclose your individual identity 
                    or personally identifiable data without your permission. When 
                    we do present aggregated information to outside companies, 
                    no one will be able to identify you or contact you.</p>
                  <p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
                    A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser 
                    from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
                    Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most Web sites, 
                    can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. 
                    We use cookies in a limited way to help facilitate site login,

                  <p>Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. 
                    If a user does not want information collected through the 
                    use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers 
                    that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature. 
                    But users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide 
                    the user with special features of the web site.</p>
                  <p><b>InterSport Site Subscriptions</b><br>

                    community provide us with a username, password and a working

                    hide that e-mail address if you wish. Participants in the 
                    community are expected to comply with the rules governing 
                    the area, but we cannot control third parties' use of information 
                    you may choose to provide in such a public forum. For more 
                    information see the community registration page.</p>
                  <p><b>Promotions</b><br>
                    From time to time, InterSport may sponsor sweepstakes, contests 
                    or other events which require the collection, processing and 
                    storage of individual contact and demographic information 
                    (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the 
                    event. InterSport may also co-sponsor these events along with 
                    other companies, in which case the user's individual contact 
                    and demographic information is likely to be shared with other 
                    participating sponsors, who may use this information as they 
                    wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information 
                    will not be released to any third-party organization other 
                    than named sponsors without the user's consent, and InterSport 
                    will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of 
                    the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing 
                    such information with any other businesses or organizations.</p>
                  <p><b>Surveys</b><br>
                    InterSport will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys 
                    of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information 
                    about them. Such information will be primarily for internal 
                    use but may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third 
                    parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated 
                    with specific individuals.</p>
                  <p><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</b><br>
                    InterSport believes that it is particularly important to protect 
                    the privacy of children. For that reason, we do not collect 
                    or maintain information at our web sites from those we actually 
                    know are under the age of 13, and no part of our web sites 
                    are structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.</p>
                  <p><b>Other Disclosure Of Personal Information</b><br>
                    InterSport will not otherwise use or disclose your personal 
                    information without your consent except (i) as described in 
                    this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order 
                    or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. 
                    This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line 
                    bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup or other public forum 
                    within our Web sites.</p>
