This may include information that can be used to contact or  identify you, such as your name, email address, or postal address.&nbsp; Some examples of this type of information  include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with  questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes, information that  you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social  networking areas on our Site, and information that you electronically submit  when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain  features of our Site. We also may ask for information (including a credit card  number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or  have payment transactions on our Site. <b></b><br>
                            <b>Location Information.</b>&nbsp;  We may collect location information (e.g., city and state and/or zip  code) that you provide.&nbsp; Certain devices  and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify the  geographical location of the device.&nbsp;  When you use such a device or browser to access our Site, your device  and/or browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your location  information.&nbsp; We also may collect GPS  information from the device if the device transmits it. Additionally, if you  download our app, we may collect your location information in order to deliver  our app services.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose to  enable certain features in our apps that require your geographic location, then  we will collect and store that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <b>Other Information Automatically Collected to Improve the Site and  Deliver Targeted Advertising.&nbsp; </b>We also  collect and store information through a variety of automatic technologies, such  as browser and flash cookies, pixels and web beacons about your use of our  Site, including device identifying information such as IP addresses, MAC  address or other device-specific alphanumerical ID numbers, the make and model  of your device, the wireless provider associated with your device, whether you  downloaded the app, the source of the download of the App (for example, whether  via a particular advertisement for the App), when the App is launched, how many  times a particular page within the Site is visited, which features the users  interact with, and your device or computer's connection to the Internet.&nbsp; If you choose to connect to our Site through  a social network such as Facebook, we may automatically collect your profile  information.&nbsp; These things allow us,  among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to  measure traffic on the Site.&nbsp; <br>
                            The information we collect may be  collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website  hosting provider, or another third-party service provider, on our behalf.<br>
                            We also may use  "cookies" and other similar technologies on the Site. Cookies are  small files that are placed on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and  to enhance your experience with the Site. By showing how and when visitors use  the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique  users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from  having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may  have entered preference information before. This Site also may use web beacons  (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to  access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted  email messages.<br>
                            How Information is Used <br>
                            We use the information we collect  from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including, for  example, for the purpose for which the information was submitted, to process  your registration request, to provide you with services and communications that  you have requested, to send you email updates and other communications,  customize features and advertising that appear on the Site, to deliver our Site  content to you, to measure Site traffic, measure user interests and traffic  patterns, and to improve the Site and the services and features offered via the  Site.&nbsp; <br>
                            We may use  location information, either information you provided by you or information  automatically collected, in order to provide you with content, services and  advertising that is relevant to your geographic area.&nbsp; <br>
                            We may combine information we  collect from you while you are using our Site with information that we collect  from other sources to customize features, content and advertising that appear  on our Site.&nbsp; <br>
                            In addition, we may use any  information submitted by or collected from you via the Site for any purpose  related to the Site, including to contact you for customer service purposes, to  inform you of important changes or additions to our Site or the services  offered over our Site, and to send you administrative notices and any other  communications that we believe may be of interest to you. <br>
  <b>Your Choices.&nbsp; </b>When we request  information from you on the Site, you may always choose not to provide us with  that information.&nbsp; But if you decline to  supply or provide us with certain information while using the Site, you may not  be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through  the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            If you want to limit the  information that is automatically collected while you use our Site, most Web  browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy  setting. If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you  may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered  through the Site.&nbsp; If you would like more  information on how to opt out of information collection practices by many third  parties, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>.<br>
                            At the time of registering for their  subscription, site subscribers are asked whether they wish to receive e-mail  from theHuddle.com, such as notification of new subscription benefits.&nbsp; We do not license or sell the list of users  who have ‘opted in’ to such mailings. </p>
                          <h3>How Information is Shared</h3>
                          <p><b>Sharing with Affiliates, Partners and Third Party Service  Providers.</b>&nbsp; We may provide your  information to our affiliates or to third parties, including our third party  service providers and contractors, for purposes related to Site administration  and other services. For example, if you use a credit or debit card to complete  a transaction on our Site, we may share your personal information and credit  card number with a credit card processing and/or a fulfillment company in order  to complete your transaction, or such service provider(s) may collect that  information from you directly, on our behalf.&nbsp; <br>
                            If you do not wish certain  information to be shared for these purposes, send a letter to the&nbsp;<a href="#OnlinePrivacyCoodinator">Online Privacy Coordinator</a>&nbsp;whose contact information is listed at  the end of this Privacy Notice.<br>
                            We also make some content,  products and services available through our Site through cooperative  relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider  partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or  services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide,  or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made  available in cooperation with our provider partner.
