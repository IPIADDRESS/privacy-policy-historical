The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their features. Personal information includes your name, street and e-mail addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. </p>
                    <p>By using InterSport web sites (hereafter "Our Sites") you agree to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the Policy, please do not use any of these Sites. This Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and we reserves the right, at our discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Policy at any time. This page should be reviewed periodically so that you remain updated to any changes.</p>

                    <p><b>Traffic Data</b><br>
  Each time a visitor comes to Our Sites, the servers -- like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information. Examples of this basic information include the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or earthlink.net), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to Our Sites) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).</p>
                    <p>We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites. As a result we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be used for internal research and analysis. We will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.</p>
                    <p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most Web sites, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. We use cookies in a limited way to help facilitate site login, identify unique browsers and to track usage throughout our sites. Cookies are also used in our message board and online chat systems and are a vital Part of their operation.</p>
                    <p>Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature. But users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with special features of the web site.</p>
                    <p><b>InterSport Site Subscriptions</b><br>
  In order to subscribe to Our Sites, subscribers to our subscription products provide InterSport with personal information including name, address, e-mail address and credit card information. InterSport keeps all such information strictly confidential and does not reuse, resell or redistribute it in any way. </p>
                    <p>At the time of registering for their subscription, site subscribers are asked whether they wish to receive e-mail from InterSport such as notification of new subscription benefits. InterSport does not reuse or resell the list of users who have "opted in" to such mailings.</p>
                    <p><b>InterSport Community</b><br>
  Subscribers to Our Sites who register for our message board community provide us with a username, password and a working e-mail address. This information to set up your community account. We do not sell or redistribute this community list and will not send you e-mail at the address you provide, except for infrequent announcements relating to the community or as needed to resolve issues that may arise with your community account. The e-mail address you register with at the community will be posted in the message boards if and when you post comments there, but you are free at any time to publically hide that e-mail address if you wish. Participants in the community are expected to comply with the rules governing the area, but we cannot control third parties' use of information you may choose to provide in such a public forum. For more information see the community registration page.</p>
                    <p><b>Promotions</b><br>
  From time to time, InterSport may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. InterSport may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent, and InterSport will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.</p>
                    <p><b>Surveys</b><br>
  InterSport will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information will be primarily for internal use but may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.</p>
                    <p><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</b><br>
  InterSport believes that it is particularly important to protect the privacy of children. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our web sites from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our web sites are structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.</p>
                    <p><b>Other Disclosure Of Personal Information</b><br>
