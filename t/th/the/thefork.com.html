Furthermore, by using any of the services offered on TheFork Site, Users     unconditionally accept to be bound by these Terms of Use. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     La Fourchette reserves the right to amend these Terms of Use at any time,     in whole or in part. It is therefore the User's responsibility to regularly     consult the latest version of the Terms of Use posted on TheFork Site.     Users are deemed to accept this latest version upon each new use of TheFork     Site. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     By accessing or using TheFork Site in any way, the User agrees to be bound     by these Terms of Use. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. <u>Description of TheFork Site</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">Use of TheFork Site is subject to limitations of liability on the part of     La Fourchette. Please refer to Article 8 "Limitation of Liability" for     details.</p><h5 style="text-align: justify;">1.1 <u>Introduction platform</u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site is a platform that allows the User to connect with the     restaurants listed on TheFork Site, among other functionnalities. As such,     La Fourchette acts exclusively as an intermediary in connection with the     reservation of said restaurants by the User.</p><h5 style="text-align: justify;"> 1.2 <u>Real time search for and reservation of tables in a restaurant </u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site allows the User to search for and reserve a table in a     restaurant in real time. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site also allows the User to cancel their reservation in the event     of unforeseen circumstances. </p><h5 style="text-align: justify;">     1.3 <u> Promotional offers from restaurants listed on TheFork Site</u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     TheFork Site allows the User, provided that the reservation is made through     TheFork Site, to benefit from promotional offers provided by the     restaurants on TheFork Site. Not all restaurants have promotional offers.     The conditions of validity of such promotional offers are set out on     TheFork Site. Users undertakes to verify the conditions of validity of a     promotional offer before reserving on TheFork Site and in no case may claim     the benefit of a promotional offer from the restaurant outside the     conditions of validity as they are set out on TheFork Site, and/or outside     the reservation procedure containing the promotional offer. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     One condition of validity is that the User and their entire party must     arrive at the restaurant reserved at the time reserved. If a User and all     their guests do not show up at the restaurant within 15 minutes of the     reserved time, the restaurant may choose to not apply the promotional offer     associated with the reservation for the User and their party. For the sake     of clarity, this means that if the User or any of their guests is more than     15 minutes late, the User and their entire party will lose the automatic     benefit of the promotional offer and the restaurant may decide whether or     not to apply the promotional offer to all or some of the guests. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. <u>Free Use of TheFork Site</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     The services offered on TheFork Site are generally free. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Tariffs may be applicable, in particular depending on changes to the     services offered, the evolution of the network, and of technical and/or     legal constraints.

However, as La Fourchette cannot physically verify     the accuracy of the information collected and/or provided by the     restaurants, Users agree that La Fourchette cannot be held liable if Users     fail to benefit from the services of the restaurant. Indeed, the settings     of the real-time reservation software depend partly on the information     provided and/or recorded by the restaurant and may not correspond to     reality.

In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions     of this Part 2, Loyalty Program – Special Conditions and those of Part 1,     General Conditions of Use, the provisions of this Part 2, Loyalty Program –     Special Conditions shall prevail. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. <u>Description of the Loyalty Program</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     The loyalty program allows Users to accumulate loyalty points ("Yums")     after each reservation on TheFork Site that is duly honoured (the "Loyalty     Program"). </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. <u>Participation in the Loyalty Program</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     Any User who holds an account on TheFork Site is eligible for the Loyalty     Program. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Participation in the Loyalty Program is free and automatic with each     reservation on TheFork Site. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. <u>Earning Yums</u></strong></h4><h5 style="text-align: justify;">3.1 <u>General conditions for earning Yums</u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     The Loyalty Program allows Users to accumulate loyalty points after each     reservation on TheFork Site that is duly honoured, regardless of the     restaurant reserved on TheFork Site and whether the reservation was made     with or without promotional offer. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     For each reservation made on TheFork Site and duly honoured, Users obtain a     pre-defined number of Yums (which may vary, depending in particular on the     method of reservation: website, mobile or application) seven days after the     date of the meal, regardless of the number of guest associated with the     reservation and regardless of the country where the reservation was made. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     In the event that the reservation is cancelled by the User or if the User     does not go to the restaurant and honour the reservation (no-show), the     User does not earn Yums. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The amount of Yums earned by each User is stored and can be accessed in the     "<a href="https://www.thefork.com/my-account/loyalty">My Loyalty</a>"     section of the User account. </p><h5 style="text-align: justify;">     3.2 <u>Special conditions for earning Yums</u></h5><h5 style="text-align: justify;">     3.2.1 <u>Special promotions with promotion code</u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     From time to time La Fourchette puts in place special promotions for a     limited period during which Users may gain more Yums than usual (the     "Special Promotion"). </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     During each Special Promotion, Users receive an email specifying the     conditions for earning extra Yums. One of these conditions is the     obligation to enter a promotion when Users make their next reservation on     TheFork Site (the "Promo Code"). </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The amount of Yums obtained through the Special Promotion is stored and can be accessed in the "    <a href="https://www.thefork.com/my-account/loyalty">My Loyalty</a>"     section of the User account. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     When issued, the Promo Code has a validity period limited to the duration     of the Special Promotion. The Promo Code has no monetary value and cannot     be loaned, transferred or sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than     those defined by La Fourchette in these Loyalty Program – Special     Conditions. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. <u>Using Yums</u></strong></h4><h5 style="text-align: justify;">     4.1 <u>Loyalty Discount conversion</u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     Once obtained and after reservation on TheFork Site, Yums can be converted     into a price discount deducted from the bill of a restaurant who is     enrolled in the Loyalty Program (the "Loyalty Discount"). </p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The chart for Yums conversion into a Loyalty Discount is available    <a href="https://www.thefork.com/my-account/loyalty" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The list of Loyalty Program partner restaurants is available in the loyalty     space of the User account on TheFork Site. Partner restaurants are also     identified anywhere on TheFork Site with the Y symbol in a circle displayed     after the name of the restaurant. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     To convert Yums into Loyalty Discount, Users must make a reservation at a     Loyalty Program partner restaurant and tick the box "I spend my Yums to get     a Loyalty Discount on the bill" before validating their reservation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     That Loyalty Program partner restaurant is then responsible for     automatically and without further formalities deducting the Loyalty     Discount from the bill. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     If the amount of the Loyalty Discount is greater than the amount of the     bill, the deduction made by the restaurant may not exceed the amount of the     bill. In other words, the restaurant cannot pay the User the difference     between the amount of the Loyalty Discount and the amount of the bill. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     In the event that there is a promotional offer applicable to the     reservation, the restaurant will apply the promotional offer before the     deduction of the Loyalty Discount. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Yums earned by Users can be converted into Loyalty Discount until 31     December of the year following the year in which they were earned. By way     of example, any Yums earned up to 31 December 2017 may be used until 31     December 2018. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The Yums are strictly personal, have no monetary value and cannot be     loaned, transferred, or sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than     those defined by La Fourchette in these Loyalty Program – Special     Conditions. </p><h5 style="text-align: justify;">     4.2 <u>Cancellation / no-show</u></h5><p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User has reserved with a Loyalty Discount and cancels the reservation,     or if the restaurant cancels the reservation, the Yums converted to Loyalty     Discount at the time of reservation will be re-credited to the User's     account and may be used for a new reservation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User does not go to the restaurant (no-show), the Loyalty Discount and     the Yums thus converted are lost and will not be re-credited to the User's     account. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. <u>Deletion of Yums</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">La Fourchette reserves the right to withhold or delete Yums obtained     through the use of Promo Codes or Sponsorship Codes by any User where La     Fourchette reasonably determines or believes that the use or redemption of     the Promo Code or Sponsorship Code was fraudulent, illegal, made in error     or in violation of the applicable Special promotion conditions or these     Loyalty Program –Special Conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Furthermore, failure by Users to comply with these Terms of Use (including     failure to honour several reservations (no-shows)), any abuse or fraudulent     use of TheFork Site and/or Yums, or any behaviour prejudicial to the     interests of La Fourchette may result in the deactivation of the User's     account and/or the immediate deletion of all or part of the Yums stored in     the loyalty space of the User's account on TheFork Site, without prior     notice or compensation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. <u>Modification/Suspension/closure of the Loyalty Program</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     La Fourchette reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the     Loyalty Program at any time without incurring any liability whatsoever. In     this case, La Fourchette will inform Users by email and/or posting on     TheFork Site indicating the new terms and conditions of the Loyalty Program     and/or the terms of the closure of the Loyalty Program. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. <u>Limitation of Responsibility</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     With respect to the Loyalty Program, La Fourchette is only oblige to use     reasonable endeavours and accept liability only in relation to the     attribution of Yums to the Users. Consequently, La Fourchette cannot be     held liable for any claims relating to Yums after they have been duly     attributed to a User by La Fourchette. More specifically, La Fourchette has     no liability once Yums have been converted into a Loyalty Discount by a     User. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     As such, La Fourchette is not responsible for any failure by the restaurant     to apply the Loyalty Discount to the User. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     In any event, La Fourchette declines any responsibility in connection to     the Loyalty Program in the event of contractual breach and/or fault of the     User. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         PART 3.

In the event of a discrepancy     between these Online Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special     Conditions and those of either TheFork’s General Conditions of Use or the     Restaurant’s General Conditions of Sale, the provisions of these Online     Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special Conditions shall prevail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The Restaurant operates a pre-authorisation reservation service (the     “Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service”) that allows Users to reserve a     table at a given date and that allows the management of no-shows, late     cancelation or amendments to the reservation by the User.</p><p><br></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>ARTICLE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF THE PRE-AUTHORISATION RESERVATION SERVICE</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     The Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service, which will take Users’ bank card     details, is provided by the Restaurant. Taking the card details allows the     delivery of a debit pre-authorisation from the User's bank. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The Restaurant has set a fixed charge per reserved cover for the bank card     pre-authorisation. The amount is specified at the time of reservation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     The pre-authorisation is not a prepayment for a User's meal. Payment for     the User's meal will only be taken at the Restaurant. The Pre-Authorisation     Reservation Service is just a guarantee for the Restaurant and no amount is     debited at the time of reservation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Nevertheless, should a User fail to honour the reservation, make a late     cancellation, or late amendment to the reservation, the appropriate sum     will be debited from such User's bank account using the card details     provided. The charge will be debited within seven days of the date of the     meal. </p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><br></h4><h4><u style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><strong>ARTICLE 2 – INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE PRE-AUTHORISATION RESERVATION     SERVICE</strong></u></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     For all reservations, the User will be required to provide the following     information: </p><ul><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Title; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Surname; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">First name; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Date of birth; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Email address; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Phone number; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Name as it appears on payment card (compatible cards are VISA,     MASTERCARD); </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Card number; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Expiry date; </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">Security number </p></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">     The entire pre-authorisation reservation process is secure (the form is     hosted on a secure web page and banking security protocol). </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Supply of the information needed to use the Pre-Authorisation Reservation     Service is mandatory.

This being     considered, the Restaurant may have to block the pre-authorisation. The     Restaurant reserves the right to cancel any reservation that is reasonably     believed to be fraudulent, improper, or which involves any illicit     activity, even if the fraud-prevention system does not block the     pre-authorisation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     It is also possible that pre-authorisation is refused by a User's banking     institution because of a limit they may have set on such User's bank card,     even if such User has sufficient funds in their account for the     pre-authorisation reservation. </p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><br></h4><h4><strong><u>ARTICLE 4 – CONFIRMATION OF  THE USER'S RESERVATION</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     Once a User's reservation has been approved by the Restaurant such User     will receive an email or text message summarising the details of their     reservation (place, date, time, how many people in the party and the sum     held in the pre-authorisation). The User will be invited to check the     information in this message and to notify the Restaurant as soon as     possible of any errors or omissions. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     In the event that a User does not receive a confirmation by email or SMS,     such User is invited to contact the Restaurant as soon as possible to     obtain their confirmation. </p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><br></h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>ARTICLE 5 – TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO AND CANCELLATION OF THE     USER'S RESERVATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRE-AUTHORISATION</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     If a User does not take up the reservation at the appropriate date and     time, or 15 minutes after the User's reserved time at the latest, and has     not cancelled in advance within the timeframe specified below, the sum     corresponding to the pre-authorised amount, multiplied by the number of     reserved covers (1 cover per person), will be debited from such User's     account. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Users may cancel/ change their reservations up to 24 hours before their         meal time.     </strong>     After that time, the Restaurant will debit the User's account with the sum     corresponding to the pre-authorised amount, multiplied by the number of     reserved covers (1 cover per person).     </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The concerned User will be notified of the charge and it will be debited     from the User's account within seven days of the date of the no-show.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">     As the system is provided to the Restaurant by the company La Fourchette     SAS, any debits to Users’ account on their bank statement will be listed     under that company’s name. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Users should be aware that amendments to reservations are subject to     availability in the Restaurant. If the Restaurant cannot accommodate the     reservation amendment due to a lack of availability, the Restaurant will     propose that the User cancels the reservation. </p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><br></h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>ARTICLE 6 – RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">     Pursuant to article L221-28, 12° of the French Consumer Code, Users have no     right of withdrawal from catering services to be provided on a specified     date or over a specified period. </p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><br></h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>ARTICLE 7 LITIGATION MANAGEMENT</u></strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">In the event of a dispute relating to the cancellation/ modification, or     operation of the Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service and/or these Online     Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special Conditions, Users may contact the Restaurant or TheFork using the following contact address:    <a href="mailto:contact@thefork.com" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: inherit;">contact@thefork.com</a>.</p><p><br></p><h1 id="Privacy Policy" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.

We keep these recordings for as long as     necessary, and then erase them. Your personal information collected during     a call is processed in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy     Policy. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Personal information includes the information that you provide us, notably     your first and last name, telephone number, postal and electronic     addresses, date of birth, password and payment information (credit card     number, cardholder name, expiry date and security code). </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     You can choose not to provide us with such personal information.

For example,     if you have registered on our site, cookies can allow us to keep your login     information, so that you do not have to re-enter your connection     information each time. </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">To customise your browsing experience and the content on our site. For     example, when you visit an internet page, we, our service providers or our     partners automatically install a cookie in order to recognise your browser     when you access the internet, and thus display information based on what     appears to be of interest to you. </p></li><li><p style="text-align: justify;">To measure and document the effectiveness of different features, offers     and electronic communications (by determining which emails you have opened     and whether you clicked on a link in the email). </p></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">     The Settings option on the toolbar of most browsers should tell you how to     prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to obtain notification     when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies that are not     useful to you. Please note that if you refuse cookies, you may not be able     to access many of the tools offered by our site. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Our site may also use web beacons (also called invisible GIFs or invisible     pixels), which are tiny digital images with a unique identifier that work     like cookies, and which are placed in the code of a webpage. We use them to     understand the browsing patterns of our users who access one page from     another page within our site in order to provide or transmit information to     the cookies, but also to know if you are accessing our site from an online     advertisement displayed on a third party site, and finally, to improve the     performance of our site. We may also allow our service providers to use web     beacons to help us determine which emails have been opened by their     recipients and to track user traffic and actions on our site. We do this so     we can better measure the relevance of our content and the effectiveness of     our offers. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>         Data collected by business partners and ad networks to disseminate         targeted advertisements     </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">     We allow third parties to collect information about your online activities     through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include     advertising agencies that collect information about your interests when you     view or interact with any of their advertisements on various websites. This     information collected by these third parties is then used to predict your     behaviour or preferences and to display targeted advertisements on third     party sites. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">     Note that we have no control or access to cookies and other technologies     that third parties may use to collect information about your interests and     their practices are not within the scope of this Privacy Policy. Some of     these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which     provides a single point of access to choose not to receive targeted advertisements from member companies.

Due     to the differences between the default configurations of internet browsers     and the way they integrate DNT signals, site operators are not always clear     whether users have actually selected the DNT parameter or whether they even     know they can configure it. Please note that TheFork is unable to take DNT     signals into account at this time. </p><p><br></p><h4 id="How we use your information" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>2.
