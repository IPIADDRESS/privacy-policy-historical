					<br>
					We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.
					<br>
					<br>
					We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them electronic information. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them.

					<br>
					We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.

If a site shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses.
					<br>
					<br>

					<br>
					<br>
					Finally, the Smartdevil sites covered by this Privacy Notice will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.
