                <p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></p>
                <p>Our Services may attempt to collect information through a number of different methods. In many cases we collect information that you provide directly when interacting with our Services. When using our Services you may be offered the chance to submit your own information such as your name, email address, sex, birth date, hobbies or other items of interest. We may also be able to collect some of that information from social networking systems where you are using our Services. We may also collect information about you from other public sources, companies or individuals. In addition to the information about yourself, you may also be providing information during the usage of the Services such as in surveys, contests or other submissions. Our services may also collect aggregate information about our users.</p>
                <p>You should also be aware that it is standard practice to collect web based browser information that helps us to improve our Services.
