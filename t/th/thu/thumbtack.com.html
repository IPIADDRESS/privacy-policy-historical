            <p>
                How we collect and store information depends on how you access and use the Platform. We
                collect information in multiple ways including when you provide information directly to us,
                when you permit third parties to provide information to us, and when we passively collect
                information from you, such as information collected from your browser or device.
            </p>
            <p><em>Information You Provide Directly to Us</em></p>

                <li>
                    We may collect information from you during your use or access of the Platform, such as:

                <li>When you otherwise communicate with us or other users through the Platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the Privacy Policy applies to all use of the
                Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include, but is
                not limited to: (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or business telephone
                number; (e) home, business or mailing address; (f) demographic information (e.g., gender,

                any other content you include in communications with other users through the Platform or
                communications with us. It may also include information specific to services you are
                requesting or offering through the Platform, such as a business name, service description,
                qualifications and credentials. You are not required to provide us with such information,
                but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the
                provision of the requested information.

            <p>
                <em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third
                    Parties</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                We may collect information about you or others through Thumbtack affiliates or through
                non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to access the Platform through a
                social networking account, such as Facebook. If you access the Platform through your
                Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain information in your Facebook
                profile. This may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of
                friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or
                who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes." Social networking sites, such as
                Facebook, have their own policies for handling your information. For a description of how
                these sites may use and disclose your information, including any information you make
                public, please consult the sites' privacy policies. We have no control over how any
                third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third parties. For
                example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect
                supplemental information from third parties, such as information about your credit from a
                credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud
                or safety protection purposes. We may combine information that we collect from you through
                the Platform with information that we obtain from such third parties and information derived
                from any other products or services we provide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through non-affiliated third parties, we may also collect information that demonstrates the
                occurrence of an off-Platform communication between a Customer Member and a Service Member
                in order to ensure accurate charging of fees imposed upon Service Members and to enforce the
                Terms of Use. Except as explicitly stated herein, we will not collect or store the contents
                of any off-Platform communication between a Customer Member and a Service Member.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you send text messages with a Customer Member or Service Member using the telephone
                number for that Member available on the Platform, we may use a third-party service provider
                to track these text messages. We track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure
                appropriate charging of Fees, to enforce these Terms, and for quality and training purposes.
                As part of this process, Thumbtack and its service provider will receive in real time and
                store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text message, your
                phone number, and the content of the text message.
            </p>
            <p><em>Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected</em></p>

                <em>Device/Usage Information</em>. We and our third-party service providers, which include
                ad networks and analytics companies including DoubleClick and Google Analytics, may use
                cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the
                computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platform. As described
                further below, we may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a)
                browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring
                or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or
                Android ID); and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track when and how
                frequently you access or use the Platform. We use this information (including the
                information collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics
                (including to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our
                users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the
                Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described
                in this Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Location Information</em>. When you use the Platform, we may collect general location
                information (such as IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us
                access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may
                collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to
                improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g. for
                identification of Pro Services available near you). To deliver customized content and
                advertising, we may share your location information with our agents, vendors, or
                advertisers. If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your
                device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other
                location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See
                your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain
                functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.

                requests, reviews, participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile
                information. Certain other people, including other users with whom you have interacted via
                the Platform, will see information about you that is attached to your name. For example (but
                without limitation), if you are a Customer Member seeking Pro Services, the description you
                provide of your desired services, along with your name, will be shown to some Pro Members
                registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other users may be able to
                personally identify you based on Content you provide. Similarly, the information we collect,
                including but not limited to when you last accessed the Platform, may be shared with other
                Members with whom you are interacting or otherwise made public.

                be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you choose to post User Content on or
                through the Platform, such as through Member-to-Member messaging or through our review

                information, we will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent
                required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law,
                retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Policy.

            <h2>SECURITY</h2>
            <p>
                We employ physical, procedural, and technological security measures to help protect your
                personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Thumbtack may use encryption,
                passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against
                unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% failsafe.
                Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your
                personal information or communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by
                others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password,
                phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer,
                choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in
                and password private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Thumbtack
                is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, or
                compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password
                activity.

            <h2>LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS</h2>
            <p>
                The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Thumbtack does not
                have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Thumbtack of those external
                websites. You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing these links to you only as a
                convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not responsible for the content of such
                external websites or the protection and privacy of information you provide while visiting
                such external websites.

            <h2>UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                You may review, correct, and delete certain information about you by logging in to the
                Platform and navigating to your preferences page in "Your Dashboard." You must
                promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request,
                we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view as soon as
                reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with
                the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems,
                assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other
                purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion. You
                should understand, however, that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, you
                may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deactivated or removed your Account,
                you agree that Thumbtack will not be responsible to you for retaining information related to
                your Account.

            <h2>YOUR CHOICES REGARDING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
            <p>
                We may send periodic emails to you. You may opt out of promotional emails by following the
                opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business
                days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about
                recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails
                about your Account or any services you have requested or received from us.

            <h2>NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</h2>
            <p>
                Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “personally
                identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license
                or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information”
                includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number,
                or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased
                or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential
                future sales under Nevada law by
                <a href="mailto:NevadaOptOut@thumbtack.com">NevadaOptOut@thumbtack.com</a>. Please note we
                will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once
                verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.

            <p>
                Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be

                offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. If you create an Account

            <p>Rights</p>
            <p>
                If you are a California resident (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act), you
                may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about
                    you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the
                    business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and
                    the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.
                </li>
                <li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
                <li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer
                to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in
                applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights referenced herein. Certain information
                may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. In addition, we need certain types of
                information so that we can provide our services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may
                no longer be able to access or use our services.
            </p>
            <p>
                If would like to exercise any of these rights, on or after January 1, 2020, please submit a
                request at <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@thumbtack.com">dataprivacy@thumbtack.com</a> or visit
                <a href="http://help.thumbtack.com/data-privacy">http://help.thumbtack.com/data-privacy</a>.
                You will be required to verify your identity before we are able to fulfill your request, for
                instance by logging into the Thumbtack platform. You can also designate an authorized agent
                to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization
                or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still
                need to verify your identity directly with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) sets forth certain obligations for businesses
                that “sell” personal information. Thumbtack shares certain personal information of Customer
                Members with select Service Members to better enable those Customer Members to find a
                Service Member who can provide a service the Customer Member has expressed interest in. To
                opt out of such sharing, you may click
                <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/syndication-opt-out">here</a> beginning on January 1,
                2020.
            </p>
            <p>Metrics</p>
            <p>
                California law may require us to compile the following metrics for the previous calendar
                year: the number of rights requests received, complied with, and denied, as well as the
                median number of days within which we responded to those requests. To the extent this
                obligation applies to Thumbtack, we will update this section after the CCPA has been in
                effect for a year.
            </p>
            <p>California Shine the Light</p>
            <p>
                If you are a California resident, you may ask for a list of third parties that have received
                your information for direct marketing purposes during the previous calendar year. If we have
                shared your information, this list will contain the types of information shared, and we will
                provide this list at no cost. To make such a request, contact us at
                <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@thumbtack.com">dataprivacy@thumbtack.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>California Do-Not-Track Disclosure</p>
            <p>
                Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information
                collected on our Platform for third party purposes. That is why we have provided links
                (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link, and a Google
                opt-out link. However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working
                on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations, and solutions.

                    the Platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the
                Privacy Policy applies to <em>all</em> use
                of the Platform.</p>
            <p>The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include,
                but is not limited to: (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or
                business telephone number; (e) home, business or mailing address; (f) demographic
                information (e.g., gender, age, political preference, education, race or ethnic
                origin, and other information relevant to user surveys and/or offers); (g) date of
                birth; (h) insurance information; (i) photographs; (j) information about your
                project, request or need; (k) video or audio files; (l) in certain circumstances,
                payment and/or identity verification information; and/or (m) any other content you
                include in communications with other users through the Platform or communications
                with us. It may also include information specific to services you are requesting or
                offering through the Platform, such as a business name, service description,
                qualifications and credentials. You are not required to provide us with such
                information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available,
                absent the provision of the requested information.</p>

            <p><em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking
                    Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties</em></p>

            <p>We may collect information about you or others through Thumbtack affiliates or
                through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to access the
                Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you access the
                Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain
                information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile picture,
                gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address,
                photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes."</p>

            <p>Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for handling your
                information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your
                information, including any information you make public, please consult the sites'
                privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses
                the personal information it collects about you.</p>

            <p>We may collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third parties.
                For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for
                and collect supplemental information from third parties, such as information about
                your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or
                trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine
                information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we
                obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products or
                services we provide.</p>

            <p>Through non-affiliated third parties, we may also collect information that
                demonstrates the occurrence of an off-Platform communication between a Customer
                Member and a Service Member in order to ensure accurate charging of fees imposed
                upon Service Members and to enforce the Terms of Use.  Except as explicitly stated
                herein, we will not collect or store the contents of any off-Platform communication
                between a Customer Member and a Service Member.</p>

            <p>If you send text messages with a Customer Member or Service Member using the
                telephone number for that Member available on the Platform, we may use a third-party
                service provider to track these text messages. We track these text messages for
                fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of Fees, to enforce these Terms,
                and for quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Thumbtack and its
                service provider will receive in real time and store data about your text message,
                including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content
                of the text message.</p>

            <p><em>Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected</em></p>

            <p><em>Device/Usage Information.</em> We and our third-party service providers, which
                include ad networks and analytics companies including DoubleClick and Google
                Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect
                information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to
                access the Platform. As described further below, we may collect and analyze
                information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating
                system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f) page
                views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID); and
                (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track when and how frequently you
                access or use the Platform. We use this information (including the information
                collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including
                to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our
                users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and
                off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as
                otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

            <p><em>Location Information.</em> When you use the Platform, we may collect general
                location information (such as IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may
                ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant
                such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we
                may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with
                location-based features (e.g. for identification of Pro Services available near you).
                To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your location
                information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform
                through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with
                location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking
                functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your
                device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain
                functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.</p>

            <p><em>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.</em> We and our third-party service
                providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help
                us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and
                analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us
                to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas,
                track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about
                Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements
                through the Platform that may interest you. We or our third-party service providers
                also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us
                track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether
                our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p>We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash cookies") to assist in
                delivering special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are
                stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web browser. To learn
                more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make
                changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>

            <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
                cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline
                cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full
                advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. Flash cookies
                operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available
                in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies,
                we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

            <p>We may display information related to your business, including your name or your
                business’s name, publicly on your profile, except to the extent we tell you we will
                not display such information. If the information you provide us upon signing up for
                an account differs from the information you provide us as part of the verification
                data we collect, we have sole discretion in determining which information will be
                displayed publicly on your profile. </p>

            <p>We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with
                information that we obtain from affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties, and
                information derived from any other products or services we provide.</p>

            <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Platform.
                We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including without
                limitation for research and marketing purposes and may also share such data with
                any third parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional partners,
                sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</p>

            <p>We may, either directly or through third parties we engage to provide services
                to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via
                the Platform or as otherwise described in this Policy for fraud prevention, risk
                assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and
                customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we
                may scan and analyze messages to prevent fraud or improper actions. We may also scan,
                review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes, as well
                as to debug, improve and expand product offerings. By using the Platform or engaging
                in off-Platform communications tracked by Thumbtack, you consent that Thumbtack, in
                its sole discretion, may, either directly or through third parties we engage to
                provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether
                done manually or through automated means.</p>

            <h3>WHEN THUMBTACK DISCLOSES YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also share the
                information that we collect from you through the Platform as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><em>Affiliates</em>. We may share your information with any Thumbtack affiliates.</li>
                <li><em>Consent</em>. We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third parties
                    based on your consent to do so. Such consent includes the disclosure of your
                    information (a) in order to provide services or products that you have requested
                    (please see below for more details); (b) when we have your permission; or (c)
                    as described in this Policy, the Terms of Use, or any other legal terms governing
                    your use of the Platform.</li>
                <li><em>Service Providers</em>. We may provide access to your information to select
                    third parties who perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a
                    variety of services to us including without limitation billing, sales, marketing,
                    advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing,
                    identity verification, fraud and safety protection and legal services. As we
                    retain new service providers, we generally seek contractual assurances from
                    these service providers that they will not use your information in any manner
                    other than to help us provide you with the services and products available from
                    Thumbtack.</li>
                <li><em>Legal Requirements</em>. We may disclose your information when required by
                    law or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a)
                    comply with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive; (b)
                    establish or exercise our legal rights including enforcing and administering
                    agreements with users; or (c) defend Thumbtack against legal claims. If we are
                    required by law to disclose your information, we will use commercially reasonable
                    efforts to notify you unless (1) we believe in our sole discretion that providing
                    notice could create a risk of injury or death, or that harm or fraud could be
                    directed to Thumbtack or users; or (2) we are precluded from providing notice
                    by law. We will attempt to provide the notice by email if you have given us an
                    email address. While you may challenge the disclosure request, please be advised
                    we may still be legally required to turn over your information.</li>
                <li><em>Protection of Thumbtack and Others</em>. We may disclose your information
                    to whomever necessary when we believe it appropriate to investigate, prevent,
                    or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
                    involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of
                    the Terms of Use or any other legal terms governing use of the Platform, and/or
                    to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of other users.</li>
                <li><em>Business Transfers</em>. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell,
                    buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of
                    our assets. In such contemplated or actual transactions or where there is any
                    change of control of Thumbtack, user information may be among the shared and/or
                    transferred assets.</li>
                <li><em>App Store Providers</em>. We may provide your identity and mobile device
                    identifier to third-party app store providers (for example, the Apple App Store)
                    to allow you to download our mobile apps.</li>
                <li><em>Academics and Research</em>. We may provide information about users to third
                    parties for academic and research purposes, in anonymized or aggregated form.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please be advised that some information you provide and/or that we collect will be
                publicly accessible. For instance, registration for an Account requires that you
                provide us with your name. If you register through Facebook, the Platform will
                use the name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in some
                instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other users.
                Depending on the circumstances, your name may be attached to your Content or
                information, such as scheduling of Pro Services, service requests, reviews,
                participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile information. Certain
                other people, including other users with whom you have interacted via the Platform,
                will see information about you that is attached to your name. For example (but without
                limitation), if you are a Customer Member seeking Pro Services, the description you
                provide of your desired services, along with your name, will be shown to some Pro
                Members registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other users
                may be able to personally identify you based on Content you provide. Similarly, the
                information we collect, including but not limited to when you last accessed the
                Platform, may be shared with other Members with whom you are interacting or otherwise
                made public.</p>
            <p>We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including, but not limited
                to, your comments, pictures, Service Member profile, and any other information.
                However, please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you choose
                to post User Content on or through the Platform, such as through Member-to-Member
                messaging or through our review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings, that
                information: (a) may be or may become publicly available; (b) may be collected and
                used by third parties with or without our knowledge; and (c) may be used in a manner
                that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>

            <h3>ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING</h3>

            <p><em>Analytics</em></p>

            <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such as those of
                Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described
                in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above to
                help us analyze how users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party
                website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be
                disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information
                to evaluate your use of the Platform. We also use Google Analytics for certain
                purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent
                Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the
                <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

            <p><em>Tailored Advertising</em></p>

            <p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform
                may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone,
                or other device to collect information about your use of the Platform in order to (a)
                inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites
                and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of
                marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing
                services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow other third parties
                (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook
                and others) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or
                other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use
                to access the Platform. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the
                use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer,
                mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform by non-affiliated,
                third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated
                third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to
                opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored
                advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with
                de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to
                us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
                non-human-readable form.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how
                you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver
                tailored marketing, you may visit the
                <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a>
                and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a>
                to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
                programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google
                Display Network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings page</a>.
                Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still
                receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case,
                the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not
                control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make
                using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
                If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page,
                or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers,
                your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available
                on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above links.</p>

            <p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application
                advertising content. Each operating system-iOS for Apple devices, Android for
                Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices-provides its own instructions
                on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content. You
                may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective
                operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising. For
                any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for
                the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.</p>

            <h3>CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE</h3>

            <p>Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information
                collected on our Platform for third party purposes. That is why we have provided
                links (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link, and a
                Google opt-out link. However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still
                working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>

            <h3>PRIVACY OF MINORS</h3>

            <p>Our Services are not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or
                older may use the Platform. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided
                us with personal information, we will close the account and delete the personal
                information to the extent required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
                We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes
                described in this Policy.</p>

            <h3>SECURITY</h3>

            <p>We employ physical, procedural and technological security measures to help protect
                your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Thumbtack may use
                encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal
                information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures,
                however, are 100% failsafe. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and
                thus you should not expect, that your personal information or communications will
                not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others. You should take steps to protect
                against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other
                things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that
                nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private,
                and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Thumbtack is not
                responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen,
                or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized
                password activity.</p>

            <h3>LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS</h3>

            <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Thumbtack
                does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Thumbtack
                of those external websites. You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing these links
                to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not responsible
                for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of
                information you provide while visiting such external websites.</p>

            <h3>UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>You may review, correct and delete certain information about you by logging in to the
                Platform and navigating to your preferences page in "Your Dashboard." You must
                promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your
                request, we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view
                as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in
                order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms
                of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem
                necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you
                transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove
                it. Once we have deactivated or removed your Account, you agree that Thumbtack will
                not be responsible to you for retaining information related to your Account.</p>

            <h3>YOUR CHOICES REGARDING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

            <p>We may send periodic emails to you. You may opt out of promotional emails by
                following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may
                take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of
                receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest
                you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any services you have
                requested or received from us.</p>

            <h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>

            <p>THIS POLICY IS CURRENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE SET FORTH ABOVE. THUMBTACK MAY, IN
                ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, CHANGE THIS POLICY AT ANY TIME. THUMBTACK WILL
                POST ITS UPDATED POLICY ON THE PLATFORM, SEND YOU A MESSAGE OR OTHERWISE NOTIFY YOU
                WHEN YOU ARE LOGGED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. THUMBTACK ENCOURAGES YOU TO REVIEW THIS
                POLICY REGULARLY FOR ANY CHANGES. YOUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM
                WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE THEN-CURRENT POLICY.</p>

            <h3>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</h3>

            <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data
                will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy
                regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the
                world. If you create an Account with the Platform as a visitor from outside the
                United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent
                to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer a
                level of protection equivalent to that required in the European Union or certain
                other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Policy.</p>

            <h3 class="c2 c10">CONTACT US</h3>
