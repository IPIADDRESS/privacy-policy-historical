                must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is
                inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal information
                because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless,
                upon your request we will close your Account and remove your personal
                information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your Account
                activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information
                from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect
                any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
                investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take
                any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our
                sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you
                publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the
                Website, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or
                removed your Account, you agree that Thumbtack shall not be responsible for
                any personal information that was not included within your deleted and/or
                removed Account that remains on the Website.

                We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on
                other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites.
                This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by
                displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.
                Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic
                measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including
                clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness
                of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third
                party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's
                specific privacy policy, not this one.  We may provide these third-party
                advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services,
                as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about
                visitors to our Site and users of our service.

                <br>
                <br>

                You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by
                members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital
                Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice
                by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this
                information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of thirdparty
                ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective
                websites:
                    <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonpii.asp">
                        www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI)

                <br>
                <br>

                Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which
                will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver
                targeted content or ads to you.  It does not mean you will no longer receive
                any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue
                to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that
                you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies
                when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies,
                use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may
                no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and
                DAA's websites accessible by the above links.
