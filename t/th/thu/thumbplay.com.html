			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>Effective September 21, 2006</p>
                    <p>We at THUMBPLAY, Inc. understand that you value your privacy and we strive to respect that privacy when you are using our services. This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and what we do to protect it.  By using the THUMBPLAY website, you are expressly consenting to the information handling practices described in this policy.</p>

                    <h4>Information We Collect From You</h4>
                    <p>When you sign up with THUMBPLAY, you establish a password-protected personal account for ordering ringtones, graphics, games and other items and services.  During the account creating process and/or to place an order, we request contact information (such as name, a valid email address, cell phone number and address) and certain billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date.)</p>

                    <p>In addition, we may occasionally request information from users via online membership profiles, surveys or contests. Participation in these profiles, surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).</p>

                    <p>Once you create an account, we keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your site activity, order history, payment history and correspondence with us.</p>

                    <p>Our website may provide you with the opportunity to send emails to your friends, family members or relatives. For this feature of our site to work, we need to collect the email address(es) of those to whom you send messages. The email addresses we collect in this context are not used for any other purpose other than to send your request. We will only resend an email to these email addresses at your request.</p>

                    <p>Our websitesÂ’ servers collect and retain technical information regarding visits to our website such as the IP address assigned to the computer visiting the site, the type of browser used by a visitor and the operating system running the userÂ’s connections to the service. This data is not linked to your personal account.  It is used in the aggregate to analyze the ways in which our site is used, and how we can improve the user experience, and may be shared, in the aggregate, with third parties such as advertisers.</p>
            <h4>Information Relating to Children</h4>
                <p>You must be at least thirteen (13) years of age to use the THUMBPLAY Services. Any person who provides their information to THUMBPLAY through the account registration page for new customers or any other part of the THUMBPLAY site represents to THUMBPLAY that they are 13 years of age or older.  If you are between 13 and 17, you agree that you received parental permission both to complete the registration process and to download content to your cell phone. THUMBPLAY is in no way directed at children under 13 years of age. We will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will promptly delete it.</p>
