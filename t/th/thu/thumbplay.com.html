This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and what we do to protect it. By using the Thumbplay website, you are expressly consenting to the information handling practices described in this policy.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect From You</h2>

During the account creation process and/or to place an order, we may request certain contact and billing information (such as your name, a valid email address and your cell phone number). We use this information to provide you with our Services and to contact you about the items in which you have expressed interest.</p>
                <p>When you create a Thumbplay account, we keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your site activity, order history, payment history and correspondence. We do this to provide you with better service, for billing and administrative functions, to improve your customer experience and for internal research and reporting purposes.</p>

                <h2>Online Account Profiles</h2>
                <p>We may request information from you through optional online account profiles, surveys or contests. Participation in these profiles, surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your mailing address), and demographic information (such as your zip code or education level). By submitting this information, you enable us to provide you a more personalized Thumbplay experience.</p>
                <p>Please note that information you provide in an optional public profile can be viewed by anyone, and can potentially be used to contact you or send you unsolicited messages. If you use a bulletin board, blog or chat room on our site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We also permit customers to upload their photos to our web site using our "Share" service. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

                <h2>Technical Information</h2>
                <p>The Thumbplay website collects and retain technical information regarding visits to the Thumbplay website such as the IP address assigned to the computer visiting the site, the type of browser used by a visitor and the operating system running the user's connections to the service. This data is not linked to your personal account. It is used to analyze the ways in which our site is used, and how we can improve the user experience.</p>

Third parties who provide website support services, billing, processing, fulfillment, marketing, and other services on our behalf may also access your personal information to provide those services.</p>
                <p>We may send you website and service announcement updates with important information about the service through the email address or cell phone number you provide.

                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>Thumbplay uses cookies in order to manage your individual visits to the Thumbplay website. Cookies are also used to determine how you were referred to the Thumbplay website, as well as your browsing and buying activities, to assist us with marketing and product development. You must enable cookies to use the Thumbplay Service.</p>
                <p>Thumbplay allows other companies that display advertisements on our website to set and access their own cookies on your computer. Use of cookies by other companies is subject to those companies' own privacy policies, not this policy. Advertisers and other companies do not have access to Thumbplay's cookies.</p>

                <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
                <p>We do not rent or share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties except to provide products and services you have requested, when we have permission, or as described in this policy, including under the following circumstances.</p>
                <p>- when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</p>
                <p>- when we believe in good faith it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms and conditions, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p>Finally, we may transfer information, including any personally identifiable information, in the event Thumbplay is acquired by or merged with another company.</p>

                <h2>Third Party Sites Appearing on the Thumbplay Site</h2>
                <p>The Thumbplay website contains links to and advertisements for sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of personal information may differ from ours. While we endeavor to associate only with reputable websites, Thumbplay cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of these other websites. Any information you provide on those sites is subject to their privacy policies, and not this policy.</p>

                <h2>Co-branding</h2>
                <p>Thumbplay maintains co-branding relationships with various service providers who include our promotional offers either directly on their websites or through inline links on their websites. When you sign up with Thumbplay through one of these websites, you establish a password-protected personal account for ordering Thumbplay ringtones, graphics, games and other items and services. During the account creation process and/or to place an order, we request, through that partner, the same contact and billing information that we ask of users who sign up directly on our website (such as name, a valid email address and cell phone number). You must agree to the Thumbplay Terms and Conditions posted to these websites in order to register. The Thumbplay privacy policy applies only to personal information collected on these websites for the purpose of Thumbplay registration.</p>

                <h2>Protecting your information</h2>
                <p>Thumbplay takes reasonable measures to safeguard your personal information during transmission and when stored on our network. However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, communications between you and the website, and the website and you, may not be secure, depending on the network you are using to communicate with us.</p>
                <p>If Thumbplay learns of a security breach through which sensitive personal information may have been compromised, we may notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this web site, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this site.</p>

                <h2>Referral Program</h2>
                <p>Our Referral Program allows you to easily tell your friends and family about Thumbplay. When you use the Program, we will ask you for you and your friend's name, phone number and/or email address. We will enable you to send your friend a one-time email or SMS message inviting him or her to visit Thumbplay, and the contact information you provide for this purpose will not be maintained by Thumbplay after your message is sent.</p>
                <p>Thumbplay uses third party service providers to administer the Referral Program. The personal information collected and stored through the Referral Program is only used for the operation and ongoing maintenance of the Referral Program and will not be used for any other purposes or disclosed to any third parties other than those service providers that help administer the Program. If you use our Referral Program to download your address book information from your web based email account, we will immediately delete any account information that you have provided us once the download is complete.</p>
                <p>You and your friends may opt-out of participation in the Referral Program at any time via opt-out links in all Referral Program communications or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:friends_support@thumbplay.com">friends_support@thumbplay.com</a> or visiting <a href="http://www.thumbplay.com/go/unsub-email" target="_blank">http://www.thumbplay.com/go/unsub-email</a>.</p>
