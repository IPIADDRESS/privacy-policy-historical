have the following rights in relation to your personal data: </p>
<ul class="number-list">
<li>Right of access — you have the right to obtain from us information as to whether your personal data
is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to such personal data. You may access and
amend your personal data, request the details about purposes of processing of your personal data and
prevent from undesirable marketing by opting-out. If you wish to opt out of marketing, use
‘unsubscribe’ option available at our e-mails.

have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, the withdrawal of your consent will
not affect the lawfulness of Thinkmobiles’s processing based on consent before your withdrawal.
</li>
<li>Right to rectification — we will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that your personal information
is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal
information that you have provided to us by sending us a request to rectify your personal data where
you believe the personal data we have is inaccurate or incomplete.
</li>
<li>Right to restriction of processing — you have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal
data at any time.
</li>
<li>Right to erasure — Asking us to delete all of your personal data will result in Thinkmobiles
deleting your personal data without undue delay (unless there is a legitimate and legal reason why
we are unable to delete certain of your personal data, in which case we will inform you of this).
Asking us to stop processing your personal data or deleting your personal data will likely mean that
you are no longer able to use our Services.
</li>
<li>Right to data portability — You have the right to request that Thinkmobiles provides you with a copy
of all of your personal data and to transmit your personal data to another data controller in a
structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, where it is technically feasible for us to do

concerns or complaints, you have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority.
</li>
<li>Right to object automated processing — you have the right not to be subject to a decision based
solely on automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which produces legal or
similarly significant effects on you. There may be exceptions or limitations to this right as
defined under relevant data protection laws. We will not ordinarily charge you in respect of any
requests we receive to exercise any of your rights detailed above, however, if you make excessive,
repetitive or manifestly unfounded requests, we may charge you an administration fee in order to
process such requests or refuse to act on such requests. When you request us to rectify or erase
your personal data or restrict any processing of such data, we may notify third parties to whom such
personal data has been disclosed of such request. However, such third party may have the right to
retain and continue to process such personal data in its own right, for example to enable it to
comply with its own legal obligations.
</li>
<li>Right to make a request - you may also send a request to receive the information which is been
processed, amended, deleted or locked and information about any parties to which we transmit your
personal data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In some case we may charge a fee (based on our reasonable costs) if the requests are excessive
considering the nature of the request itself or nature and functionality of our services.</p>

to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. </p>
<p>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us carry out certain
internal functions, such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys
or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a non-affiliated third

e-mail address, to help us analyze and identify client needs, notify clients of product and service
offerings or conduct general marketing and market research for us. </p>
<p>Thinkmobiles also forges partnerships and alliances with non-affiliated third parties which offer
high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these
products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant,

information agree to keep your information confidential and use such information solely for the limited
purpose for which we have engaged them, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, where offers are
made to you by non-affiliated third parties, we always require that they disclose that the offer is
being extended because of your relationship with us. We also seek to ensure that these nonaffiliated
third parties maintain appropriate data security procedures to guard against unauthorized use of, or
access to, your personal information. </p>
<p>When required by law, Thinkmobiles reserves the right to disclose your personal information to third
parties or regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your
information to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect our rights or
property. If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, for
example by clicking on an advertisement on a website owned or controlled by Thinkmobiles, any personal
information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement. We are
not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and we have no control over
the use or protection of information provided by you to, or collected by, those websites. Whenever you
elect to link to a cobranded website or to a linked website, you may be asked to provide registration or
other information. Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party and you
should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy published by that third party. </p>

terms are made here we will notify you additionally within reasonable time via e-mail provided by you.
