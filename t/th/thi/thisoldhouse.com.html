</p><blockquote>
<font size="+1"><b>WGBH ONLINE VISITORS' PRIVACY POLICY</b></font><hr>
<p>
WGBH knows you don't want the information you provide us
shared indiscriminately. Here we explain how <a href="http://main.wgbh.org">WGBH Online</a>
 collects information, what we do with it, and
what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy
of your personally identifiable information, protecting the security
of making financial transactions, and preserving the integrity of
the medium. </p><p>

The privacy policy set forth here refers solely to <a href="http://main.wgbh.org">WGBH
Online</a>. Please read it carefully, and if you have
any questions or concerns, send us an e-mail at
<a href="mailto:feedback@wgbh.org">feedback@wgbh.org</a>. Also, note that we link to
numerous other sites, such as <a href="http://www.pbs.org" target="_blank">PBS</a>  and
<a href="http://www.npr.org" target="_blank">NPR</a>. Please consult those sites to learn more
about their policies.</p><p>

<b>Gathering and Use of Information</b></p><p>

<a href="http://main.wgbh.org">WGBH Online</a> does not collect personally identifiable
information from our visitors other than what is supplied to us
on a voluntary basis (such as your name, address, e-mail
address, telephone number, and/or other identifying
information) when you e-mail us or respond to surveys, for
example.</p><p>

As a visitor to the WGBH Web site, you may be requested to
supply certain personally identifiable information in order to
participate in some activities. These include becoming a WGBH
member, pledging financial support, and making an
e-commerce transaction. You may be asked to provide
information for contest registration or to subscribe to special
services (such as e-mail newsletters).</p><p>

Personally identifiable information also may be requested in
connection with certain content submissions, community
postings (e.g., forums or bulletin boards), comments and
suggestions, or voting.</p><p>

You should recognize that under certain circumstances, if you
choose not to voluntarily submit requested information you may
not be eligible for certain activities -- e.g., online-only contests --
for which personally identifiable information is needed. </p><p>

<b>E-mail Addresses and E-mail Mailing Lists</b></p><p>

WGBH maintains a customer database with e-mail addresses
of viewers and listeners who have provided them to WGBH by
e-mailing us with questions about membership, submitting an
online membership contribution (making an online pledge), or
sending us an e-mail about our programs or services. We will
use these addresses to send our constituents information
about WGBH programs, services, or membership. The e-mail
mailing lists are for the sole use of WGBH. We do not sell,
exchange, or lend out our e-mail list to outside companies,
organizations, or individuals. You can have your e-mail address
removed from the WGBH e-mail list at any time by going to
<a href="http://www.wgbh.org/contact/">WGBH Online's "Contact Us" page</a>  and using the "Feedback
Form." If you have already opted out, rest assured that we will
continue to honor your request. </p><p>

WGBH Donor Postal Address List

Like many nonprofits, we occasionally exchange portions of our
Donor Postal Address List with other carefully selected nonprofit
educational, cultural, health, and social service organizations in
the communities WGBH serves. When you make an online
contribution, your name and address will be included on this
exchanged list. Please note that on every online contribution
form, we give you the opportunity to opt out of having your name
and address added to our Donor Postal Address List. We HAVE
NOT and WILL NEVER share or exchange our donors' e-mail
addresses or phone numbers with any third party. Our
exchange list program provides other nonprofits with only your
name and postal address.</p><p>

If at any time you would like to check or update our record of your
information, please let us know either by calling the WGBH
Member Hotline at 617-300-3300, Monday-Friday between 9am
and 5pm EST; by writing to us at WGBH, Box 200, Boston, MA
02134; or by <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/contact/">using our online form</a>. If
you already have opted out of having your information added to
our Donor Postal Address List, we will continue to honor your
request.</p><p>

<b>Secure Credit Card Transactions</b></p><p>

<a href="http://main.wgbh.org">WGBH Online</a> offers you the convenience of
making purchases and membership contributions via credit
card. WGBH takes seriously the need for credit card account
information security. Our Web financial transaction forms are
stored and served from a secure server. This means that each
page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on
its way between computers (yours and ours). Even in the highly
unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, it will not be
usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit
card information is a top priority for us. All online credit card
transactions are done through a Netscape Secure Server using
40-bit SSL; you know you're on a secure page when the Web
address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit
card information is used only for your intended purpose - that is,
for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.</p><p>

<b>Cookies and Browsers</b></p><p>

A "cookie" on the Web is a unique number assigned by a Web
site to a user's visit to that site. In general, cookies are used to
customize user experience, count how many people visit a site,
and track which pages on a site receive visits. </p><p>

WGBH Online uses cookies to help us determine how visitors
use our site so we can improve your online experience. Our
cookies do not contain any personally identifying information
and are used only by us, in order to provide better statistics on
traffic throughout our site. <a href="http://main.wgbh.org">WGBH Online</a> cookies expire when you quit your browser. They are not saved
to your computer's hard disk. </p><p>

When visiting any Web site, your browser sends information to
the site's hosting server identifying the browser you're using,
your Internet service provider (ISP), the page you last visited,
and the page you're currently visiting. Your browser does not,
however, send any personally identifying information to Web
sites unless you explicitly provide that information in a form.
Thus, WGBH Online cannot extract any personally identifying
information about you from what we receive via your browser.</p><p>

<b>Acceptance of this WGBH Online Visitors' Privacy Policy </b></p><p>

By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and
conditions of this WGBH Online Privacy Policy. If you do not
agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this
site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change,
modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please
check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued
use of <a href="http://main.wgbh.org">WGBH Online</a> following the posting of
any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted
those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please
e-mail us at <a href="mailto:feedback@wgbh.org">feedback@wgbh.org</a>. </p><p>
