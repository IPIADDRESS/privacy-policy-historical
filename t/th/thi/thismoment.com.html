<h1>thismoment Distributed Engagement Channel (“DEC”) Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The
application that you are viewing is called the thismoment Distributed
Engagement Channel (“DEC” or the “Service”).  The DEC is
operated by us, thismoment, Inc., for our partner whose content and
brand are featured in the DEC.  The DEC is a multi-media application
that enables our partner to tell you about its products, services or
special events while also allowing you, the user, to participate in
the experience by submitting your own content, such as comments,
photos and videos. The DEC may include content from multiple social
networks and sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr.
The DEC may appear on the website of one or more of those services,
on our partner’s site or on other sites.</p>
<p>Because
we are offering the Service on behalf of our partner, all information
that we collect is made available to our partner whose DEC you are
viewing under the terms of this Privacy Policy (e.g., if you are
interacting with a DEC for Chevy, the information we collect is made
available to Chevy).  This information may also be made available
under the terms of this Privacy Policy to the operator of the website
where you interacted with the DEC under the terms of this Privacy
Policy (e.g., if you interacted with the DEC on YouTube, the
information we collect may be made available to YouTube).  
</p>
<p>In
some cases, the DEC may also include a link to our partner’s
privacy policy, in which case the information that we collect may
also be used under the terms of that policy (e.g., if you are
interacting with a DEC for Chevy and a link to Chevy’s privacy
policy is also displayed on the DEC, then the information collected
through the DEC is also subject to Chevy’s privacy policy).  
</p>
<p>This
Service is not intended for use by persons under thirteen (13) years
of age. Thismoment does not knowingly collect Personal Information
from or about children under the age of thirteen (13).</p>
<p>For
the privacy policy applicable to my.thismoment.com, see
<a href="http://my.thismoment.com/privacy">my.thismoment.com/privacy</a>.

</p>
<p><br>
<strong style="font-size:16px">Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>We
may collect the following kinds of information. 
</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide</strong></p>
<p>Thismoment
collects information from you when you provide it to us, such as when
you register for our Service, enter a contest, submit content to the
Service (such as a video or photo submission), or communicate with
us, such as through email or SMS.  The information you provide us may
include information that personally identifies you (“Personal
Information” or “PII”), such as your name, your email address,
your phone number or your mailing address.   
</p>
<p>See
the section below called “Public Activity” about information that
you submit to public areas of the Service</p>
<p><strong>Information from services that you use to connect to our Service</strong></p>
<p>We
may also receive information about you from the service that you used
to connect to our Service (e.g., if you use your account with
Facebook, YouTube or Twitter to log into our Service).   This
information is described in the privacy policy for that service or in
the permissions message that you receive when connecting through that
service.  It can include your name, your user name on that service,
your email, information about your friends on that service and
information about the activity of you and your friends on that
service or on our Service.  Please review the privacy policies of any
service that you use to connect to our Service as well as any
permissions notice that you get during the connection process. 
</p>
<p><strong>Information from cookies and similar devices</strong> 
</p>
<p> Cookies
are data that we place on a user’s browser that allow us to know
how often someone visits a site and the activities they conduct while
using the Service (such as the pages visited, links clicked on,
videos viewed, commenting activity, contest voting, etc.).  Every
computer is assigned a different cookie by thismoment.  
</p>
<p><strong>Information from mobile devices</strong></p>
<p>If
you are interacting with our service on a mobile device, we may
receive your device and hardware ID, device type, carrier, carrier
user ID, the content of your request and basic usage statistics about
your device and usage of our Service.  If you use location-related
aspects of our Service, we may also receive information about your
actual location.  If you provide it to us or send us a message from
your mobile device, we may also collect your phone number.  Your
device may also store information about your usage of our Service. 
Please consult your device documentation on how to manage local
storage.   
</p>
<p><strong>Information based on standard web protocols</strong></p>
<p>When
you access our Service through a browser, application or other
client, like other web providers, our servers automatically record
certain information.  This data is recorded in server logs and may
include information such as your web request, your interaction with
the Service, the website that you were visiting when you came to our
Service, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and
language, the date and time of your request, and your cookie data. 
</p>
<p><strong>Information
from third-party applications</strong></p>
<p>Some
of our DECs include third-party applications, which have their own
privacy policies that govern their collection of information.  Any
information received by thismoment form those third-party
applications will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics
technologies</strong></p>
<p>We use third party service
providers to help us collect, report and analyze information about
how users interact with our Service.  These providers include Google
Analytics (<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">see
privacy policy</a>) and Omniture (<a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product">see
privacy policy</a>). 
</p>
<p><strong>Information
Collected by Third Parties </strong>
</p>
<p>This
Privacy Policy only applies to thismoment’s Services.  It does not
apply to, and we do not have control over, the sites on which our
Services are distributed or products, services or sites that are
linked to from within our Service.  These sites may place cookies on
your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
 We may also display advertisements on our sites, and in the course
of serving the ads, some advertisers and their ad serving partners
may place cookies on your computer or may recognize and collect data
based on a cookie previously placed on your computer.  We do not have
access to or control over the data or cookies of these third parties.

</p>
<p><strong>Public
Activities</strong></p>
<p>This
Privacy Policy does not apply to any public activity on the Service. 
Public activity is any activity that is visible to other users, such
as posting a comment, entering a submission in a contest, or
uploading a video or photo.   Any information that you submit as part
of any public activity, including your name, user name or photo,
becomes public.  Public information may be used by thismoment and the
partner on whose behalf thismoment is offering the Service for any
online or offline promotional or commercial usage, in any and all
media.  It is also visible to, and may be used by, any other user of
the Service.  Thismoment has no obligation to remove any information
that you have made available through public activity.  You should
think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any
online public environment. 
</p>
<p><strong>Information Usage</strong></p>
<p>Here are the ways that we use the information that we collect in
connection with your usage of the Service:</p>
<ul>
	<li>to provide our Services to you and develop new services;</li>
	<li>to perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses, including to determine:
        <ul>
            <li>how users interact with our Service;
            </li>
            <li>the success of a campaign or promotion being offered by our Partner;
            </li>
            <li>the level of interest in our Partner’s products or Services;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </li>
	<li>to
	customize the products and services we offer to you and to allow
	advertising to be served to users based on what we think is most
	relevant or interesting to them; 
	</li>
	<li>to
	contact you in connection with a contest or sweepstakes or if you
	have requested to receive information from us or our partner;
    </li>
	<li>to
	protect the rights, safety or property of thismoment, our partners
	and our users. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>This
section sets forth the circumstances in which thismoment may share
your Personal Information with a third party. 
</p>
<p>As
mentioned above, thismoment is providing the Service on behalf of the
partner whose branding and content are featured in the DEC, and as
such acts as a data processor for its partner.  Accordingly, all
information gathered in connection with your usage of that partner’s
DEC, including your Personal Information, will be provided to that
partner for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition,
this information may also be provided to the website through which
you are accessing the Service (e.g., Facebook or YouTube).  Our
partner may also display its own privacy policy through the DEC, in
which case our partner may also use the data in any manner permitted
by that privacy policy. 
</p>
<p>We
also contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf,
such as web hosting services, application development, analytics,
security, and data processing.   These companies are obligated to
maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information and are
restricted from using it for any purpose that is incompatible with
the uses set forth in this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p>We
may disclose Personal Information to our corporate subsidiaries or
affiliates. Any Personal Information provided to thismoment’s
subsidiaries or affiliates will be treated in accordance with the
terms of this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p>We
may provide Personal Information about you where we have a good faith
belief that it is necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law,
regulation, legal process or government requirement; (b) enforce any
applicable terms of service, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address
fraud, security or technical issues or (d) protect against harm to
the rights, property or safety of thismoment, its partners, its users
or the public. 
</p>
<p>If
thismoment undergoes any merger or sale of its stock or some or all
of its assets, we may transfer your Personal Information to the
successor entity so long as it continues to maintain that information
in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected. 
</p>
<p>Other
than as described in the preceding paragraphs, thismoment will not
(a) sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your
Personal Information or (b) use your Personal Information for any
purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy, without
your consent.   
</p>
<p><strong>Changes
to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Any changes to this policy
will be posted at this URL:  thismoment/privacy. We will not use data
we collect in a manner that is materially different from promises
made in the version of the Privacy Policy under which it was
collected without your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Updating
your Personal Information </strong>
</p>
<p>You can contact us by
emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@thismoment.com">support@thismoment.com</a>
and we will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to
your Personal Information in order to correct, amend or delete it
unless prohibited by law.   We may decline to process requests if it
would require effort disproportionate to the privacy risk, would
violate the rights of others or would prejudice an ongoing legal
proceeding or investigation.  Because of the way we make back-up
copies of our data, residual copies of the information may remain in
our backup systems.  We also may not be able to delete Personal
Information that you have submitted through public activities, and
even after removal and it may remain viewable in cached and archived
locations or on other websites not within our control.  We may charge
a reasonable fee to access your Personal Information if to do so
would require disproportionate effort. 
</p>
<p>Updating or deletion of
your Personal Information will not have any effect on other
information that thisMoment maintains.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We recognize that security
is important and take reasonable measures to protect your Personal
Information from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure,
alternation or destruction.  If you believe that the Personal
Information you have provided us has been compromised, or if you
become aware of a potential security vulnerability in our Service,
please contact us at privacy@thismoment.com.</p>
