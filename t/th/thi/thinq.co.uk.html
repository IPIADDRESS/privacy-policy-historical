              THINQ is committed to ensuring the security

              access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy 
              and ensure the appropriate use of information, 
              we have put in place appropriate physical, 
              electronic and managerial procedures to 
              safeguard and secure the information we 
              collect online. Our site and all our customers' 
              information reside on our in-house server, 
              behind our firewall. Online ordering is 
              secure provided that your browser can 
              support secure transactions (most browsers 
              support this facility). You can determine 
              when you are in a secure environment by 
              locating the key (Netscape browsers) or 
              lock (Microsoft browsers) symbol at the 
              bottom of the browser page. When the key 
              or lock is complete, the information provided 
              by you is encrypted, restricting access 
              by anyone else. If your browser does not 
              support secure transactions, there is 
              a chance that others may view any information 
              that you send. You can check your browser's 
              "help" button to learn more 
              about secure transaction support. <br>
