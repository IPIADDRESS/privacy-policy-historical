We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, respond to any problems that may arise, such as difficulties in navigating our sites or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users.</p>
<p>
	<b>III. HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b></p>
<p>
	We share your personal information only as described below.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Sharing Within the TA Media Corporate Family</i></b>.<b> </b>We may share your personal information with any parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate in the TA Media corporate family. All entities within the TA Media corporate family may have access to your personal information as well as anonymous, aggregate demographic data.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>TA Media’s Service Providers</i></b><b>. </b>TA Media may decide to share your personal information with companies that work on behalf of or with TA Media. These companies may use your personal information to inform you about TA Media’s products and services, to provide you with information about other exciting products and services, or otherwise to assist TA Media in serving its customers, understanding its consumer market, or devising effective marketing strategies to reach more consumers.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Lead Purchasers</i></b><b>. </b>TA Media may decide to share your personal information with third parties who purchase leads from TA Media.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>[Participating Vendors.</i></b> Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.]</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Credit Card Companies; Third Party Payment Services; Third Party Promotional Sites</i></b>. As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost. TA Media will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company. In some cases, we use third party payment and transaction services to facilitate your transactions and process your orders. In such cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with the third party payment services solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order. In some cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with third parties who may offer you a gift or promotional offer as a result of your purchase.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Other Third Parties</i></b>. We may share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, sponsors, and other promotional and business partners, only when you have not opted out of receiving communications from third parties. If you wish to opt-out of receiving third party communications, you may exercise this right by following the opt-out procedures contained in any e-mail or written communication TA Media sends to you or by following the procedures set forth in Section VII of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Public Postings</i></b>. You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through TA Media’s web sites or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through TA Media’s web sites or any other service available online).</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Required Disclosures of Information</i></b>. We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our sites and our property and assure adherence to our terms of use; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation or process.</p>
<p>
	<b><i>Changes in Corporate Structure</i></b>. In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>
	<b>IV. HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</b></p>
<p>
	Your web browser offers “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a web site. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our websites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings will not be available to you.</p>
<p>
	<b>V. HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?</b></p>
<p>
	A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line. TA Media employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. Many of these technologies are provided to TA Media via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior. In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, e-mail address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.</p>
<p>
	Some of our web pages, promotional e-mail messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our web sites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional e-mail messages. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.</p>
<p>
	<b>VI. WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</b></p>
<p>
	Some of the banner ads displayed in our web sites are provided by third parties. These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons. Unlike cookies and web beacons used by TA Media in content it controls on its web sites, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. Dart is our primary third party ad server. If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and “opt-out” procedures, please see <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/opting_out.aspx</a>.<b> </b></p>
<p>
	<b>VII. HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b></p>

We incorporate standard industry practices suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this policy.

The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions at the website where you registered<b>. </b>Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions or within any system cannot be assured.

We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure environments. Remember, however, that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information, and we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party.<b> </b></p>
<p>
	<b>IX. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b></p>
<p>
	TA Media is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of children who visit our Web sites. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 13. Many of our sites include chat rooms, bulletin boards and other features that we believe are unsuitable for children under 13 and which are not necessarily monitored. We encourage all parents to talk to their kids about online safety and to monitor their children’s use of the Internet. <b> </b></p>
<p>
	<b>X. THIRD PARTIES AND LINKS</b></p>
<p>
	In the event that you provide personal information to any third party via any TA Media web site or any offer made available to you by TA Media, you understand that TA Media is not responsible for such third parties’ use or misuse of your personal information. You should review the privacy and information sharing practices of such third parties. Additionally, TA Media may offer links to or from web sites it controls to other sites within the TA Media family as well as to sites operated by third parties. We offer links to third party sites so that you can conveniently visit our vendors and advertisers or locate other content likely to be of interest. We are not responsible for the content, practices or policies of sites operated by third parties and urge you to inquire about them before providing any personally-identifiable information.</p>
<p>
	<b>XI. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</b></p>
