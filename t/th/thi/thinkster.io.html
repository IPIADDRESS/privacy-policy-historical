your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  Thinkster uses both
session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you

subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following
your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and

refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
features of thinkster.io may not function properly if the ability to accept
cookies is disabled.</p>

<p>Log File Information. When you use thinkster.io, our servers automatically
record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any
website. These server logs may include information such as your web request,
Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring
/ exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing
pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on
particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies
that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>

<p>Clear Gifs Information. When you use thinkster.io, we may employ "clear gifs"
(a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our
Users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition,
we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track
which emails are opened by recipients.</p>

<p>Third-Parties.  Thinkster may receive personally identifiable information about
you from third parties, including, for example, information about your
transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and
service providers, and your use of certain applications. For example, if you

particular individual user.</p>

purposes).</p>

<p>Improve Thinkster.io.  We use both your personally identifiable information and
certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve
the quality and design of thinkster.io and to create new features, promotions,
functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing our users’
preferences and trends. We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information
to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during
your visit or the next time you visit thinkster.io; (b) monitor the
effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (c) monitor aggregate metrics
such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.</p>

<p>Provide Services.  We provide personally identifiable information and
non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such
information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such
information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable
efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate
confidentiality and security measures.</p>

<p>However, we do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name
or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or
marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or
feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p>

<p>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User
usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks,
etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage
patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or
functionality on thinkster.io.</p>

<p>Legal Requests and Comply with State and Federal Laws.  We may release
personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable
information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such
action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S.
Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p>

<p>Thinkster also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable
information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Thinkster
believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of
Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself
against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement
agencies, to protect the security or integrity of thinkster.io.</p>

<p>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy.  In the event that Thinkster is
acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any
of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected
from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of
control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of
laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not
be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or
used.</p>

<p>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites. Thinkster may allow other
companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve
advertisements within thinkster.io. These third-party ad servers or ad networks
use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links
that appear on the thinkster.io. They automatically receive your IP address
when this happens.</p>

<p>These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in
order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Thinkster does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of
a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
opt-out.</p>

<p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad
servers or ad networks. Thinkster’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we
cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
through thinkster.io, in which case Thinkster may not be able to provide
certain services to you.</p>

<p>You may update or correct your personal profile information and email
preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page.</p>

<p>Thinkster uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to Thinkster and thinkster.io and you do so at your own risk. Once we
receive your transmission of information, Thinkster makes commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note
that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed,
disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,
or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If Thinkster learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify
you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Thinkster
may post a notice on thinkster.io if a security breach occurs. Depending on
where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security
breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to

changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner
described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received the personal
information you provided. Your continued use of thinkster.io constitutes your

with respect to such information.</p>
