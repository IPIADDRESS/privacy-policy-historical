                  that it has received unsolicited information from a minor through 
                  the Library, we will notify the minor that we may not accept

              </p><p>This Policy applies only to www.thinkquest.org. The Foundation,

                privacy and other terms for each linked or framed site prior to 
                submitting any personally identifiable information. 
              </p><p>SECURITY&nbsp;

                and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk 
                of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure 
                or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the 
                nature of the data concerned.
