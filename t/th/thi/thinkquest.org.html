<p>
<b>Privacy  and ThinkQuest</b>
<br>
We respect the privacy of visitors to our Web site and the privacy of participants in  ThinkQuest programs.   In order for you to understand what information we may collect, why we collect it, how we use the information   the following explanation is offered.
</p>

<p>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>
<br>

An example of  personal information we do collect, is information that can be used to add a visitor to an email list or a  mailing list.  Personal information is also collected about participants in our programs, for the purposes
of administering those programs and communicating with the participants.
</p>
<p>
 We will not make personal information available to outside  organizations, except for organizations  that work with us on the ThinkQuest programs.  In that case, such personal information is
used only for purposes related to the ThinkQuest programs.
</p>

<p>
 When requested, we will remove a person from our email list or  mailing list. Please see the section  explaining the procedure below.
</p>

<p>
