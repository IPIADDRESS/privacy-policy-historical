				<p>Thinking  Phone Networks may use the information obtainable from a Website for editorial  and feedback purposes and for other purposes. <br>
                  <br>
For example, Thinking Phone Networks may provide aggregate information to its  in-house and independent sales representatives, use the information for  marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of user  behavior, for product development, to inform advertisers as to how many  visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, to target markets and to  formulate our own proprietary and business strategies and plans.

Content and other information related to emails  sent by user to Thinking Phone Networks may be used as testimonials or for any  other marketing purpose, except that no marketing communications unrelated to  the subject matter of the submission will be sent to the email address from  which such email or form is sent unless the user specifically elects to receive  additional marketing materials or we obtain the email address through another  avenue that permits such use. In all cases, email addresses may be compared to  subscription or customer lists of Thinking Phone Networks and its business  partners. <br>
<br>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
				<p>The  Website may contain links to third party sites. Access to any other Internet  site linked to the Website is at the user's own risk and Thinking Phone  Networks is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information,  data, opinions, advice, statements, terms of use or privacy practices of such  other sites unless it is also a Website owned or controlled by Thinking Phone  Networks.

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>Thinking Phone Networks Websites take precautions to protect  our users' information.

Thinking  Phone Networks will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone  call or in an unsolicited e-mail.

  <br>
			      By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of information by Thinking  Phone Networks. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy and our  Terms of Use at any time and for any reason.
