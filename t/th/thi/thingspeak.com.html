<h3>2. How we use and collect your information</h3>

<p>We will not sell or rent your personal contact information to other

below. thingspeak.com has several forms and additional collection methods that permit
the uploading of contact, payment, and other information. Providing such

<p>MathWorks uses the personal information it collects for the following
purposes:</p>

<ul type="disc">

<p><strong>IP addresses and cookies</strong>. We use your IP address to
administer our websites and, occasionally, to help diagnose problems with our
server. We may use data collected in web server log files, JavaScript code, and
cookies to analyze visitors’ behavior to better understand their needs. When
you visit thingspeak.com and access Account applications, one or more cookies
may be placed on (or read from) your machine if your browser is set to accept
cookies. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard
drive through your web browser. These cookies do not store any personal
information on your hard drive; they consist of a simple code that is used to
access your account information, maintain current session data, gather broad
demographic information, and help analyze websites traffic. MathWorks may use
such non-personal information for a variety of purposes including, but not
limited to, market research and improving the content of our websites.</p>

to receive cookies by modifying the settings of your web browser to disable
cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to take
advantage of all of the features of thingspeak.com or other websites you visit.</p>

<p>MathWorks engages a third-party web traffic analysis company to log
aggregate information coming through our websites on our behalf. MathWorks
controls how that data may and may not be used. When you visit our websites,
the third-party web traffic analysis company may use technical tracking methods
such as cookies, and web beacons, on our behalf, and may receive anonymous
information about your browsing on our websites. These technical tracking methods
are not used to relate websites visitors to any personally identifiable
information. Information collected by MathWorks is unique to individual
visitors but is not personally identifiable to the third-party web traffic
analysis company. Such information provided to MathWorks may be re-associated
by MathWorks with previously collected information for internal purposes only,
including but not limited to providing visitors with relevant content. We may
also use these technical tracking methods in e-mails to determine whether the
recipients have opened such e-mails, clicked on links contained in those
e-mails, and continued to browse our websites. No personally identifiable
information, such as your name, street address, or e-mail address, is shared
with the third-party web traffic analysis company.</p>

<p>We allow third-party companies, including a third-party social bookmarking
service, to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our websites
and share or bookmark content.</p>
