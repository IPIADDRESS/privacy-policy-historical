<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">When you read the privacy policies of most web sites, they read like legal disclaimers about how the company can (ab)use your data. Obviously, we have to explain the legals, but what is most important is that <strong>our founders value privacy</strong> and we don't want to do the minimum necessary to comply with laws, but actively protect our users and their data.</p>
<h3>How do we do this?</h3>
<p>We have a range of services that we supply which include collecting data that could identify you as an individual. We try to <strong>ask for the minimum information necessary</strong> to provide that service. In many cases, like consuming our news and help content, we don't need to know anything about you. In other cases, like if you sign up to our e-mail newsletters, we need to know your e-mail address (and yes we'd like to call you by your first name as well, so we do ask for your name too, but we're not going to check your ID to verify it matches!). We do advise you not to use your real name as username on our site/forums, as this is visible when you comment on news articles or post on our forums.</p>
<p>We ask you for your postcode to deliver you information that is relevant and to map your speed test results, but we don't for example ask for your house number, because this is not necessary to deliver the service.</p>
<h3>Information we collect</h3>
<p>Here is an outline of the type of personal information we collect for each service, why we collect it, and how we use it:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4">

<p><span>General Web Site Use, e.g.:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IP Addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cookies/browser information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Postcode (optional)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<p>IP addresses are the foundation of how the internet routes traffic and are needed to send back the web pages you request; we log this information for diagnostic and statistical purposes. We do not block you from accessing our site through anonymous proxies (although we may restrict content to prevent robots from harvesting it, or from posting spam). We may also ask for your postcode, so that we can better tailor information for you (e.g. we can give you a list of broadband packages that are available to you, rather than packages we know you can't order). We may use other such information for statistical purposes to tailor our site.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Registered User Account</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You can register an account on our main site and forums which means you wil need to register a user name, provide an e-mail address, your name/company (optional). We link your services to the account (e.g. speed tests, BQM, etc.) when you are logged in.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Speed Test</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We log your speed tests against your user account, if you're logged in. If not, we may log a browser identifier, IP address and other information about the test.</p>

<p>Broadband Quality Monitor (BQM)</p>
</td>

<p>We store your IP address which is necessary to provide the service, as well as your ISP details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>E-mail address for updates</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We may ask you to provide an e-mail address to which we can send updates, even if you do not have an account on our systems.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Advertising</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>We serve advertising using a number of common industry platforms including Google DFP/Adsense. They may use cookies and other technologies which interact directly with your browser. When you click on a link, you will be redirected to an advertiser's site. <strong>We do not share personal information you supply to us</strong> (e.g. your e-mail address) with any advertisers, but to serve you an ad, your web browser may disclose information such as your IP address to advertisers when requesting an advert. Information on how you can choose your settings can be found below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Affiliate Links</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Some of our links to companies which provide good/services may be 'affiliate' links which pay us when you sign up and buy something; when you click on a link you will be directed to the supplier's site and be subject to their privacy policies. <strong>We do not share any personal data with such companies</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We may use the data to notify you of any changes to our service, to respond to queries you make, to deliver the service on our site, to keep the site safe and secure, to measure and understand the effectiveness of our site or advertising on it, to improve our site or understand how to present it best to you, to comply with any legal obligation of any kind, to protect the vital interests of any natural person, or&nbsp;to perform tasks carried out in the public interest.</p>
<p>In most cases, we will use data supplied by you, and in a manner which you would expect (i.e. to help us provide the service), so this means our lawful basis for processing is<em>&nbsp;</em>legitimate interest.</p>
<h3>How we share data</h3>
<p>We <strong>do not sell or share our user data</strong> (e.g. e-mail addresses) to/with any third parties for marketing purposes. We may use external companies to deliver some services for us. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand our website's user flows, we use Google Adsense and other advertising networks to deliver advertising, and we may use third parties to deliver e-mails on our behalf when you've subscribed to something. Where we do so, we will only provide the information necessary to provide the service and within the same privacy framework (i.e. they they may only use this data to deliver the service on our behalf).</p>
<p>We do share statistical data on broadband speeds, availability, take-up, etc. with third parties (n.b. most of this is freely accessible on our website, for example on <a href="https://labs.thinkbroadband.com/local">labs.thinkbroadband.com/local)</a>, but we will not share data which personally identifies you.</p>
<p>We may share your personal data if it is to protect your vital interests, or if we are required to by law or to enforce our terms and conditions, or if our business assets are sold/transferred (in doing so they will be used in conformance with this policy).</p>
<h2>General Policy</h2>
<p>thinkbroadband is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and to using technology to enhance your online security. The information that you provide us with, or that is gathered automatically helps us to monitor our service and provide you with the services that you have subscribed to or access on our site.</p>
<p>We do not share subscriber information with third parties without your prior consent other than in cases of investigating or reporting abuse.</p>
<p>We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully and in accordance with the data protection legislation.</p>
<h3>Posting personal information to public areas</h3>
<p>Please bear in mind that any personal information that you submit through forums, comments on news articles, etc. are published on our site and may be collected by others. If you are unsure about how any information you submit is used, please e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com">team@thinkbroadband.com</a>&nbsp;before submitting anything and we can clarify.</p>
<h3>E-mail</h3>
<p>We may send e-mails to users who have registered with us, and we use this and other information you provide for demographic purposes. We do not give our user list out to other parties and we only e-mail registered users. We do not approve of unsolicited e-mail and do not believe e-mailing users against their wishes is respectable. To that end we keep all e-mails to a minimum, unless a regular update is specifically and explicitly requested by the user. You can remove yourself from all our lists automatically by following instructions at our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thinkbroadband.com/unsubscribe.html">unsubscribe page</a>&nbsp;(if you are having difficulty,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com?Subject=Difficulty_Unsubscribing">drop us an e-mail</a>). To cancel your forum account, please <a href="mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com?Subject=Delete_Forum_Account">contact us</a> and we'll sort it out.</p>
<p>We request that any information you provide us is kept up-to-date so that if you fill in any of our surveys, we may contact you to gather more information.</p>

<p>On occasion we may conduct online surveys. This is used to gauge our service, collect demographic information and other information that we may find useful. These surveys are optional. We may share non-personal, aggregated information with third parties. We may cross-analyse survey responses between various surveys and use answers to tailor your experience on the site (e.g. if you tell us that you are concerned about broadband quality, we may provide suggestions in future about how to measure and track broadband quality on our site). We will not share any such categorisation information with third parties.</p>

<p>We ask for the minimum amount of data to provide the services we offer, so for example we may ask for your postcode, but not your house/flat number, since for the services we offer, postcode-level information is adequate to give you information about broadband services in your area, and we do not wish to store unnecessary data.</p>
