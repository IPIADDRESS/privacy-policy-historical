      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to: (i) anonymous information you  provide to us online while visiting or using our Site, (ii) personally  identifiable information you provide to us as part of the process of  registering as an Authorized User; and (iii) personally identifiable  information that Authorized Users provide to us, such as assignment responses  or test scores.</p>

      <p>We will <u>not</u> share personally identifiable information  you provide via the Website with any third party, other than as expressly  disclosed in this Policy.&nbsp; By "<strong>personally identifiable information</strong>"  we mean information that identifies you, such as your name, student ID, or any  combination of this or similar information that may reasonably be used to  identify you.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>We collect information from Site Visitors and Authorized  Users at different points on our Website, and use this information as follows:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="fieldNameBold">3.1.1.	District and School Administrator Account.</span> After a successful program order has been placed, we  will send an individual access code to the party named on the "key  technical contact" portion of the order form.&nbsp; Provision of this individual access code,  along with the user information (including first and last name) and selection  of the appropriate school district, will allow a user to create either a  District or School Administrator Account.</p>
          <p><span class="fieldNameBold">3.1.2.	Teacher Accounts.</span> Teachers may self-register by selecting the  appropriate district and school, providing their user information (including  first and last name), and entering the individual access code that accompanies  the print material package that they receive along with the program that was  purchased.&nbsp; A district or school  administrator must approve a Teacher Account before that teacher may create  Student Accounts, and otherwise obtain access to ThinkCentral's full  teacher-based functionality.&nbsp; </p>
          <p><span class="fieldNameBold">3.1.3.	Student Accounts.</span> Those with Overseer Accounts can either import Student  Accounts or manually register particular students, in order to create a Student  Account.&nbsp; In order to register a Student  Account, the registering party must provide: (i) the student's first and last  name, (ii) grade, (iii) username; and (iv) password.&nbsp; Registering parties may also provide  additional information about students during registration including: (a) a  middle initial, (b) student ID, (c) gender, (d) English proficiency, (e)  ethnicity, (f) special conditions, (g) special services; and (h) economic  status.</p>
