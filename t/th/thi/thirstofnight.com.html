<h3 id="info-types">The Type of Information We May Collect</h3>

  Services. The following examples are provided to help you better understand the information we may collect through
  your use of and/or interaction with the Websites and/or Services:</p>
<ol>

    (such as your Facebook account) as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the

    while downloading or using our Mobile App.</p></li>
<li>

    and last name, user name, date of birth and gender, You should exercise care and caution in creating your Profile
    as your Profile, including your Profile Information, will be publically viewable to others and may in some

    and/or Profile Information may be used by third parties to make contact with you in unwanted ways, and Kabam is
    not responsible for information you supply in your Profile and/or the manner in which it is used by others.</p>

  <p><strong>Public Posting/Shared Content: </strong>Some of the Kabam Websites or Services may allow you to interact
    with other users and/or post, share, communicate with, or otherwise transmit content publicly, such as by
    participating in player forums, message boards, news feeds, status updates, posting public comments to users’
    profiles, sending messages or invitations to other users, chatting with other users, posting photo, and/or posting
    comments to a wall (collectively “Shared Content” or “Public Posting”). We may collect and store archives of such

    disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Policy and the Terms of Service, including but not limited to protecting
    the safety and well being of members of the public, minors, Kabam users, our employees, and our Websites or
    Services.</p>

    may in some instances be viewable outside of Kabam as such Public Postings may, in certain instances, show up in
    Internet searches and/or be indexed by search engines. Using certain tools, it may be possible for you or third
    parties to copy, cut, and/or post your Public Posting or other information to different locations (including to
    websites not owned/operated by Kabam). This may result in the disclosure of private information on third party
    websites—for which Kabam is not responsible—and, in some cases, may subject you to liability for information
    posted by or about you. Therefore, you should exercise caution in all Public Postings, and we recommend you do not
    provide personal information that may be used to identify and/or contact you in a Pubic Posting. To request
    removal of your personal information from our public forums, contact us
    at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@kabam.com">privacypolicy@kabam.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to

  <p>On some Kabam Websites and Services, your User Name as well as your Profile Information may be displayed in
    conjunction with your Public Posting. Thus, those accessing this information may be able to identify you, using
    other available source of information, such as your related Third Party Platform account or information on other
    websites.</p>

    card information, and we will not use your payment information we collect except as needed to fulfill your
    purchase and/or communicate with you regarding your transaction.</p>

    or Services via email or text message, we may ask for your friend’s name, e-mail address, phone number and other

  and/or rights under this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Service Providers, Contractors or Agents.</strong> We may share your information with third party
  companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, order fulfillment, data analysis,
  marketing services, e-mail campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing the services for us,
  these companies may access your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by us for the
  purpose of our requested service. In some cases, when you provide information to us using a third-party interface,
  your information may be collected subject to the third party's privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Business Transfers, Sales or Mergers or Divestitures. </strong>In the event that Kabam undergoes a business
  transition, such as a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of
  all or a portion of its assets, we may share, disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal
  information, to the successor organization in such transition.</p>

<p><strong>Business Partners. </strong>In conjunction with the running of our games we may partner with a third party to
  assist us in providing you with our services. We will share the information you provide us through your social network
  such as (1) your first and last name, (2) your profile picture or its URL, (3) your user identification number of the
  pertinent social network, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile picture (4) the
  login email you provided to the pertinent social network upon registration; (5) game play information with these third

</p>

<p><strong>Advertising of Third Party Products/Services. </strong>We may use and share with third party advertisers (and
  other third parties) certain Technical Information and/or Aggregate Information to show general demographic and
  preference information among Kabam users. We may also allow advertisers to collect Technical Information or Aggregate
  Information, which they may share with us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The
  information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user
  experience by increasing the likelihood that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a
  practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user
  activity to improve your experience). To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of
  advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative
  website <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>
  .</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Features: </strong>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like
  button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to
  enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly
  on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p><strong>Offer Walls: </strong>Kabam games or their purchase pages may display an “offer wall” that may be
  hosted by a third party offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency
  to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include
  signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not controlled by or made by Kabam. These
  offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous
  demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by
  Kabam or a partnering Third Party Platform.
  <strong>To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier will be shared with the offer wall
    provider.</strong> This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate
  offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you may then be
  returned to a Kabam Website or Service.</p>

<h3 id="security">How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?</h3>

<p>Kabam takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized
  alteration, disclosure or destruction of, sensitive data that you share and we collect and store. These security
  measures may include practices such as keeping your sensitive data on a secured server behind a firewall, transmitting
  sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered on our site or mobile application using secure socket
  layer technology (SSL), internal reviews of our data collection practices and platforms, as well as physical security
  measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store your information. Unfortunately, however, no
  security system can be 100% secured, and we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Kabam, the Websites
  or Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the information we collect through the Websites or
  Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
  failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. Your password is an important
  component of our security system. As such, it is your responsibility to protect it. Do not share your password with
  any third parties. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should change it immediately and follow
  the notification procedures set forth in Section 6 of our Terms of Service.

<h3 id="do-not-track-signals">How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h3>

  reflect the actual preferences of our users. &nbsp;Accordingly, Kabam does not respond to the federal Do-Not-Track
  signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to receive no promotional communication from Kabam, you are free to follow the
