                  <p class="tw111"><b>Privacy</b><br>
                    ThinkWave, Inc. has created this statement in order to demonstrate 
                    our firm commitment to privacy.<br>
                    ThinkWave, Inc. uses your Internet Protocol (IP) address to 
                    help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
                    our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic 
                    information.<br>
                    ThinkWave, Inc. uses cookies to store and sometimes track 
                    information about you. Cookies are pieces of information that 
                    a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping 
                    purposes. Cookies do not personally identify users, but they 
                    do identify a user√¢s computer. ThinkWave, Inc. generally 
                    uses cookies to:<br>
                    - personalize your view on ThinkWave.com; <br>
                    - deliver content and advertisements specific to your interests; 
                    <br>
                    - estimate audience size; and <br>
                    - measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of the website 
                    you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. 
                    <br>
                    Our site's registration form may ask users to give us contact 
                    information such as name and email address and demographic 
                    information such as zip code, age, or income level. We use 
                    customer contact information from the registration form to 
                    send the user information about our company and promotional 
                    material from some of our partners. The customer's contact 
                    information is also used to contact visitors when necessary. 
                    Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out 
                    section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected 
                    at our site. We use this data to tailor visitors' experiences 
                    at our site, showing them content that we think they might 
                    be interested in, and displaying the content according to 
                    their preferences. This information may be shared with advertisers 
                    on an aggregate basis. Personal information will not be shared 
                    with advertisers. ThinkWave may provide personal information 
                    to third parties, including but not limited to law enforcement 
                    agencies, if required to do so by law or court order.<br>
                    This site contains links to other sites. While we certainly 
                    try not to link to any sites that contain unsuitable or inappropriate 
                    material, ThinkWave, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy 
                    practices or the content of any sites but our own.<br>
                    Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, 
                    products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information 
                    such as their email address and financial information such 
                    as their account or credit card numbers. Contact information 
                    from the order form is used to send orders, information about 
                    our company, and promotional material from some of our partners 
                    to our customers. The customer's contact information is also 
                    used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users 
                    may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out 
                    section below.) Financial information that is collected is 
                    used to bill the user for products and services.</p>

                    ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or 
                    email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the 
                    secrecy of your passwords and any account information. </p>

                    We do NOT collect online contact information without prior
