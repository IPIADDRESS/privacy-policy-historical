			<p>thirtydaychange.com respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This privacy statement provides notice of the standards and terms under which thirtydaychange.com protects the privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by thirtydaychange.com, including thirtydaychange.com and www.thirtydaychange.com. This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.</p>

			<p>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:<br>
			thirtydaychange.com typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enrol for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to thirtydaychange.com through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfil your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want thirtydaychange.com to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that thirtydaychange.com not use your information by sending an e-mail to: support@thirtydaychange.com<script async="" src="//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script><script async="" src="./Privacy_files/analytics.js"></script><script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
