      traffic to track abuse of our network and its data.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, when you submit information
      about yourself to ThinkTarget.com&nbsp; over the Internet the information may travel
      over many systems that are not under the control of ThinkTarget.com . To prevent
      unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
