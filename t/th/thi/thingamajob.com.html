				<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p><a href="/Canada-Privacy.aspx">Canadian Users Click Here</a></p>
				<h2>Updated 4/2004</h2>
				<p>Thingamajob is committed to protecting the privacy of all visiting job seekers 
					who post personal information on the site. We understand the sensitivity felt 
					by job seekers when conducting a job search via the Internet, and we have 
					implemented a privacy policy aimed at protecting your personal information.</p>
				<h2>Information Gathered by Thingamajob</h2>
				<p>Thingamajob collects personal information that is voluntarily provided by users 
					when a user signs up for a thingamajob.com account, submits his or her resume 
					for inclusion in the thingamajob.com resume database, or responds to a specific 
					position listed on thingamajob.com. This information may include, but is not 
					limited to, a user's first and last name, address, telephone numbers, email 
					addresses, social security number , and job experience, as well as any other 
					personally identifying information a user may elect to include on hie or her 
					resume. This personal information is utilized and maintained by Thingamajob for 
					the purpose of facilitating the job search process and to help us find you a 
					suitable job match.</p>
				<p>Thingamajob also gathers general information regarding how users utilize the 
					thingamajob.com service, including, but not limited to, how many users visit 
					the site, how long each visit generally lasts, how frequently users visit 
					different areas of the site, and how frequently users click on banners for 
					thingamajob.com's affiliated companies and/or links to third party sites. This 
					is gathered on an anonymous, aggregate basis about all of our users and is not 
					identifiable to specific users.</p>
				<h2>Use of Information</h2>
				<p>Except as described below, thingamajob.com does not voluntarily provide users' 
					personal information to others.</p>
				<p>Thingamajob generally shares users' personal information with its affiliates to 
					facilitate the job search process. This sharing of information with affiliates 
					may include combining the information gathered by Thingamajob with information 
					separately gathered by these affiliates into one database useable by 
					Thingamajob and all of its affiliates. However, Thingamajob does not guarantee 
					that third parties will not gain access to this database, and we are not 
					responsible for the use or privacy of data under such circumstances.</p>
				<p>Thingamajob may disclose a user's personal information to a third party client, 
					but only if the user has authorized Thingamajob to share the information.</p>
				<p>Thingamajob may employ third party companies from time to time to perform 
					certain functions on its behalf such as analyzing data, hosting web servers, or 
					providing marketing services. These third party providers may have access to 
					users' personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they 
					are not permitted to share that information with any third party. Thingamajob 
					also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or to 
					protect the rights and property of others.</p>
				<p>As noted above, Thingamajob also gathers certain information on an aggregate and 
					anonymous basis regarding users' visits to Thingamajob. This aggregate 
					information may be shared by Thingamajob with third parties.</p>
				<p>Thingamajob will not knowingly sell users' personal information to anyone.</p>
				<p>Users should note that when voluntarily displaying personal information (for 
					example, phone numbers or e-mail addresses) over the Internet, the information 
					may be accessible by third parties. Thingamajob does not guarantee that third 
					parties will not gain access to users' information transmitted over the 
					Internet or to the thingamajob database, and we are not responsible for the use 
					or privacy of data in these circumstances.</p>
				<h2>Public Forums</h2>
				<p>Thingamajob may make message boards, news groups, and/or other public forums 
					available to users. Any information that you disclose in these areas becomes 
					public information that may be accessed by third parties, and you should use 
					caution before deciding to disclose any personal information in these forums.</p>
				<h2>Cookies…what are they?</h2>
				<p>Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your computer's hard 
					drive. We use cookies for remembering user names, passwords and preferences, 
					maintaining information about whether a user is currently logged into our 
					systems, and tracking click streams. Because of our use of cookies, we can 
					deliver faster service and a more personalized experience to you. You have the 
					option to set your web browser to reject cookies; however, doing this may not 
					allow you to take complete advantage of Thingamajob's functionality.</p>
				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<p>If at any time, you have any questions or concerns about the Thingamajob site or 
					our policy, please feel free to contact us using our online help form.</p>
