AND WHY?</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c4"></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c0">We collect and use the following
information to provide, improve, and protect our
Services:</span></p>
<p class="c4"></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c2">Information You Provide:</span></p>
<ul class="c10 lst-kix_n97t6ovdsl1y-0 start">
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Account
Information</span><span class="c5">. You can browse our site
without providing personal information, but you must register in
order to access most of the features of Service. Depending on how
you interact with the Service, we may ask for certain information
such as your</span> <span class="c5">legal name</span><span class="c0">, email address, a description of your purpose when using the
Service (business or education), your industry if your using the
Service for business purposes, your role (teacher or student) and
your school name and school district, if you’re suing the
Service for educational purposes, and password when you create a
Thinglink account. Depending on your Settings, some of this
personal information may be displayed on your public profile and
viewable to others on the Service.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Optional Profile
Information.</span> <span class="c5">After you setup your account,
Thinglink members may also choose to provide additional information
which may be shared with others on the Service or through your
public profile, such as your name, email address, nickname or
online alias, other Thinglink accounts you choose to follow,
Immersive Images (as defined in the</span> <span class="c5 c15">Content Information</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;section
below), websites, and other information relating to your User
Content or your use of the Service. In connection with your use of
the Service, we may also collect information created or provided by
you, or that we otherwise receive, in connection therewith. For
example, if you send or enable your users to send SMS messages
through the Service, we will collect and maintain the call data
(e.g., receipts, phone numbers, size, time of transmission,
confirmations, etc.) and other message transmission and conversion
data, which may include personal information.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Payment and Billing
Information</span><span class="c0">. We also collect credit card or
payment information for paid subscriptions. This information will
be securely stored with a third party specialized in the handling
of such information, such as a credit card payment gateway or other
payment vendors.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Content Information.</span>
<span class="c5">Our Service is designed to make it simple for you
to store your User Content, collaborate with others, and work
across multiple devices to create unique, engaging visuals
(“</span><span class="c8">Immersive Images</span><span class="c0">”). To make that possible, we store, process, and
transmit your User Content as well as information related to it.
This related information includes your profile information, which
makes it easier to collaborate and share your User Content with
others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it
was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity. Our Service
provides you with different options for sharing your User Content.
You may provide us with information about you in draft and
published User Content (such as for your Immersive Images). For
example, if you create an Immersive Image that includes biographic
information about you or someone else, we will have that
information, and so will anyone with access to that Immersive Image
if you choose to publish the Immersive Image publicly.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Messages.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you correspond with us, you may also provide us
information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our
engineering or support teams about a question regarding the
Service, or post a question about your User Content in our public
forums.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Telephone
Information.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;If we telephone you, or
you telephone us, to discuss our Service, we may collect personal
information from you, including your name, company name, business
address, phone number, job title, email address, whether you use
the Service, information about your business needs, the number of
users of our Service you require, and, if you telephoned us, how
you heard about us, and any other information you choose to share
with us by telephone.</span></li>

<p class="c4"></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c8">Information We Collect
Automatically:</span></p>
<ul class="c10 lst-kix_wc4yupialiw-0 start">
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Device
Information.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Like most online service
providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile
devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser
type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference,
referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and
mobile network information. Your devices (depending on their
settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.
We collect log information when you use our Service–for
example, when you create or make changes to your Immersive
Images.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c8">Usage
Information</span><span class="c0">. We collect information related
to how you use the Service, including actions you take in your
account (like sharing, editing, viewing, and moving files or

In order to gain useful insights, these analytics providers may set

YouTube receives data about your activity). Thinglink does not
control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what
they will do with it. So, third-party embeds on the Service are not

<p class="c4"></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c5">We recognize that from time to time
we may have children under 13 use the site under the supervision of
a parent or an educational institution acting as an agent of their
parent. When that happens, we take additional precautions to
protect the privacy of children under 13. The Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act ("</span><span class="c8">COPPA</span><span class="c0">") requires that we inform
parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose
personal information from children under 13 and that we obtain the
consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 to
use certain features of our Site. This Kid's Privacy Policy is
designed to give parents information in addition to that provided
in our general Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<h2 class="c13" id="h.rfh9b3ayiabe"><span class="c3">Personal
Information we collect from kids under 13.</span></h2>
<p class="c7"><span class="c5">When a user creates a Thinglink
account, we may ask for legal name, email address, a description of
your role when using the Service (student, retailer, freelancer,
etc.), and password and</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;a birth
date</span><span class="c5">.</span> <span class="c5">If we
determine the child is under 13 (a "kid"), we will ask for a
parent's name and email address so that we can notify the parent
that the kid has created an account at Thinglink and seek the
parent's consent to allow the kid's participation. If the parent
provides consent, we may collect additional information from the
kid, including a profile avatar, which could include a photograph,
or other content uploaded by the kid to the
Service.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The information we collect
from kids may be directly linked to their actions on the
Service.</span></p>
<h2 class="c13" id="h.osaqlnw43xro"><span class="c3">Information
collected through cookies and other technology.</span></h2>
<p class="c7"><span class="c0">We automatically collect certain
types of usage information when a kid uses our Service. For
example, we may collect an IP address, browser type, information
about the kid's mobile device, and other information. This data is
collected using technologies such as cookies, web beacons and other
unique identifiers. This information may be collected by Thinglink
or by third parties. To learn more about this type of data, see
"Use of cookies and other technology to collect information" in our
general Privacy Policy. We use this information to remember
information so that the kid will not have to re-enter it during a
later visit; provide custom, personalized content, monitor site
analytics, and improve our service. We do not permit third party
behavioral advertising on our site.</span></p>
<h2 class="c13" id="h.o851s8ijgwtn"><span class="c3">How we use and
share information collected from kids.</span></h2>
<p class="c7"><span class="c0">We use this information to operate,
maintain and provide the functionality of the Service and to
communicate with the kid and the parent about activities on the
Service. We may also send Service-related emails (e.g., account
verification, changes or updates to features of the Service,
technical and security notices). Registered users cannot opt-out of
Service related emails. When a kid under 13 creates a Thinglink
account, we use the parent's email address to notify the parent of
the kid's registration (see "How we notify parents of the data
collection" below).</span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c5">Our Service generally permits users
to connect with others on the Service and to share information with
others.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Members under 13 have
restricted sharing capabilities, though a kid under 13 may be
permitted to share information in the following manner:</span></p>
<p class="c4"></p>
<ul class="c10 lst-kix_jde9i0eijjpz-0 start">
<li class="c6"><span class="c5">Kids will share information
automatically with a parent and the kid’s teacher(s) if the

<h2 class="c13" id="h.eqmka83vc49z"><span class="c3">How we notify
parents of the data collection.</span></h2>
<p class="c7"><span class="c0">We send parents an email when their
kid creates an account at Thinglink and ask the parent to register
with the Service and provide consent for the kid to use the
Service. If the parent refuses to allow the kid's registration, we
delete the kid's information from our databases. The kid will not
be permitted to engage in the core functionality of the Service
unless and until we receive verifiable parental consent to engage
in such activity. Where the Service is used by a child for
educational purposes, the educational institution may act as an
agent of the parent for purposes of providing verifiable consent.
At that time, the kid will be able to participate in the Service as
permitted by the parent or educational institution acting on behalf
of the parent.</span></p>
<h2 class="c13" id="h.i9uihmbw9cw6"><span class="c3">How parents
can access, change or delete information collected from their
kids.</span></h2>
<p class="c7"><span class="c5">A registered user can modify
personal data or delete a Thinglink account at any time by visiting
the "Settings" page. may view, modify, and consent to the
collection and use of the kid's personal information. A parent or
child may contact us at any time by emailing us or by contacting us
at the address below to review, change, and/or delete any
information we have collected from a kid under 13 as well as to
disallow any further collection or use of the child's
information.</span> <span class="c5 c16">We will take steps to
verify the identity of anyone requesting personally identifiable
information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact
the child's parent or legal guardian.</span></p>
<p class="c4"></p>

this Kid's Privacy Policy, or if you feel that we have
inadvertently collected information from a child without notifying
a parent or obtaining consent, you can contact us at: Email:</span>
