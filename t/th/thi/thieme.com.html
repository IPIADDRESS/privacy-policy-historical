<p><strong>Use of Google Analytics </strong> </p>
<p>Based on our legitimate interest in analyzing, optimizing and in the commercial operation of our online business according to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, we are using Google Analytics, a web analytics service by Google LLC (“Google“). Google is using cookies. The information, created by cookies, about the use of our online offers by our users are normally sent to a Google server in the U.S. and saved there.&nbsp;Google has been certified under the Privacy Shield Frameworks and thus guarantees to adhere to the European data privacy laws (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a>). Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offers, to compile reports about the activities within our online offers and to provide further services to us that are connected with the use of our online offers and internet usage. For this, pseudonymous user profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.&nbsp;We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the users‘ IP addresses will be shortened by Google in the European Union member states or in other countries that are members of the “Agreement creating the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement)”. In exceptional cases only, the full IP address will be sent to a server in the U.S. and shortened there.&nbsp;The IP addresses transmitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other Google data. Users can prevent the storage of the cookies through a respective setting in their browser software. In addition, users can block the collection and processing of those data by Google which were created by the cookie and which refer to the use of our online offers by downloading and installing the browser plugin available under the following link:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.&nbsp;Further information on data usage by Google, potential settings and options how to object can be found on the Google websites: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners</a> (“How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services“),&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads">http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads</a>&nbsp;(“Data usage for advertising“),&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.de/settings/ads">http://www.google.de/settings/ads</a>&nbsp;(“Manage information Google is using to display ads for you“).</p>

<p><strong>Use of Mouseflow </strong></p>
<p>Some of our websites use Mouseflow, a web analysis tool of the Mouseflow ApS, Flaesketorvet 68, 1711 Copenhagen, Denmark, to register randomly selected visits (only with anonymized IP address). This will create a protocol of mouse movements, mouse clicks and keyboard interaction with the intention to describe random individual visits of this website as so-called session replays as well as evaluate them as so-called heat maps and to derive potential improvements for this website from this. Data registered by Mouseflow are not personal and will not be forwarded to third parties. Storage and processing of the collected data is taking place within the EU. If you do not wish any data collection by Mouseflow, you can withdraw from it on all websites using Mouseflow, by clicking the following link: <a target="_blank" href="https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/12718607/mouseflow.de?p=eyJzIjoiZGhhRFQxZUtGZV9uUzRHakkwdjRROHk4SDZJIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjoxMjcxODYwNyxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21vdXNlZmxvdy5kZVxcXC9vcHQtb3V0XFxcL1wiLFwiaWRcIjpcIjQ1NGNlODFkYmUyMzQ5MTNiZGM2ZjMwMDMyZDgxOWQ4XCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiNTEzNmIwNDFiM2EzN2MxY2U5NzQ3ZmI0MjdlODJmYjU0ZWFiMGRhOVwiXX0ifQ">https://mouseflow.de/opt-out/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Use of VG Wort measuring methods</strong></p>
<p>Some of our websites use VG Wort „Skalierbare Zentrale Messverfahren“ (SZM) by INFOnline GmbH (INFOnline GmbH, Brühler Str. 9, D-53119 Bonn, Germany.) for the determination of statistical values regarding the copy probability of texts. Anonymous measurements are made for this. The access count measurements alternatively use a session cookie or a signature which is created from automatically transmitted information of your browser to recognize computer systems. IP addresses will only be processed in anonymized form. The procedure was developed taking into account data privacy regulations. The only goal of the procedure is to determine the copy probability of individual texts. Individual users will not be identified at any given time. Their identity will always be protected. They will not receive any ads via the system. Many of our sites are using JavaScript requests which are used to send access data to Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort). This makes it possible that our authors participate in the payouts by VG Wort which secure the legal pay for the use of copyrighted material according to (53) UrhG. User usage and metadata will be processed for this, and IP addresses will be shortened while the measurement processes are pseudonymous in this. The shortened IP addresses will be stored for a maximum of 60 days. Usage data in connection with a pseudonymous identifier will be stored for a maximum of six months. In addition to that, users are provided with an opt out to withdraw from data collection for the above mentioned purposes: <a target="_blank" href="https://optout.ioam.de/">https://optout.ioam.de/</a>.

In this case, the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops applies.</p>
