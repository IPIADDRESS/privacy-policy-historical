		<ul>
			<li><strong>Navigational Information.</strong>  We collect navigational information such as browser type and version; the service provider used to access our Online Channels; whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites; and for visitors using a mobile version of our Websites or a Mobile Application, technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookie support by the device and how images may appear.  </li>

		</ul>
		
		<h5>How Do We Use Information Gathered Through Technology?</h5>

		Information gathered through technology allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of our Websites, possibly the city from which devices connect to our Websites, and difficulties visitors may experience in accessing our Websites.  Cookies are also used to associate you with your independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultant, keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, and to tell us whether you have visited our Websites in the past.  Pixel tags in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails.

		<h3>What information is not covered by this privacy policy?</h3>

		<p>We may share your personal information with third party service providers that assist us in such things as: developing and administering our Websites; conducting surveys, sweepstakes or contests; sending and administering emails or text messages; performing marketing services; or other similar services.</p>  

		<p>If we were ever merged with or acquired by another company or sold substantially all of our assets, or if we acquire another business entity or substantially all of its assets or we are involved in a corporate reorganization or other change of control, some or all of the personal information collected about you could be shared with this entity, and it may also be retained by us.</p> 

		<p>We will not otherwise share, sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Online Channels, the Online Channels or the public.</p>

		<p>We reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.  If we ever change our Privacy Policy, then we will post the new policy on this page so that you are always aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
