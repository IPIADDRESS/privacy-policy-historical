    <p>Protecting privacy is always a priority. To underscore our fundamental commitment to privacy and our vision that good privacy is good business, we have adopted a online privacy policy for each of our Web sites. This policy reflects and implements our corporate privacy principles.</p>

In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
