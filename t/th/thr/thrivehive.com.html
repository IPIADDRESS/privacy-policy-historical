In those cases, we do not transfer your unique Personal Information to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, or provide customer support.

<p><strong>4.4. Use of Navigational Information</strong><br>

<p><strong>4.6. Use of Credit Card Information</strong><br>
If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>4.7. Service Providers</strong><br>
We employ other companies and people to provide services to visitors to our Websites, our customers, and users of the Platform and may need to share your information with them to provide information, products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer service. In all cases where we share your information with such agents, we explicitly require the agent to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies.</p>
<p><strong>4.8. Security of your Personal Information</strong><br>
ThriveHive’s Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.

<p><strong>4.9. Social Media Features</strong><br>
Our Websites include Social Media and Email Features, such as the Facebook Like button Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.</p>
<p><strong>4.10. External Websites</strong><br>
Our Websites provide links to other websites. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the content or practices of these other websites. Our provision of such links does not constitute our endorsement of these other websites, their content, their owners, or their practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites, which are subject to any privacy and other policies they may have. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any web site you visit.</p>
<p><strong>4.11. Blogs</strong><br>
We offer publicly accessible blogs. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public blogs this information may be collected and used by others. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the Websites if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below.</p>
<p><strong>4.12. Retention of Personal Information</strong><br>
We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about the Platform or our other services, and then we securely delete the information. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below. If you provide information to our customers as part of their use of the Platform, our customers decide how long to retain the personal information they collect from you. If a customer terminates its use of the Platform, then we will provide customer with access to all information stored for the customer by the Platform, including any Personal Information provided by you, for export by the customer according to our agreement with our customer. After termination, we may, unless legally prohibited, delete all customer information, including your Personal Information, from the Platform.</p>

<p><strong>4.14. Compelled Disclosure</strong><br>
We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Information if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a law, court order, or legal process.</p>
<p><strong>5. Navigational Information</strong><br>
<strong>5.1. Cookies</strong><br>
We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Platform, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the ThriveHive Platform or Websites you visit. ThriveHive keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within ThriveHive, in order to determine what portion of the ThriveHive Website or Platform is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the ThriveHive Website and Platform to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<p><strong>5.2. Log Files</strong><br>
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by ThriveHive for the operation of the Platform, to maintain quality of the Platform, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the ThriveHive Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.</p>
<p><strong>5.3. Tracking Pixels</strong><br>
We employ a software technology called tracking pixels, that help us better manage the Website and Platform by informing us what content is effective. Tracking pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use tracking pixels in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by tracking pixels in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting Out and Unsubscribing”.</p>
<p><strong>5.4. URL</strong><br>
One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of websites. ThriveHive collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and, if you are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. ThriveHive also collects and stores the time and date on which you shortened the original URL and when you share the ThriveHive Link, and information on the channels through which the ThiveHive Link was shared.</p>
<p><strong>5.5. Metrics and Analytics</strong><br>
ThriveHive collects information about accesses (such as clicks) of every ThriveHive Link created through the Services. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and physical location of the devices accessing the ThriveHive Link; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; and (iv) information about sharing of the ThriveHive Link on Third Party Services such as Twitter and Facebook. These metrics and analytics are used by ThriveHive and its partners to improve their websites and services by, for example, providing value-added features.</p>
<p><strong>5.6. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers</strong><br>
Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Platform. ThriveHive does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.</p>
<p><strong>5.7. Third Party Tracking Technologies</strong><br>
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies</p>
<p><strong>5.8. Advertising</strong><br>
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>
<p><strong>6. Opting Out and Unsubscribing </strong><br>
<strong>6.1. Reviewing, Correcting and Removing Your Personal Information</strong><br>
If you provide us with your Personal Information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:<br>
To review the user information that you have supplied to us<br>

<p><strong>6.2. Anti-Spam Policy</strong><br>
Our Acceptable Use Policy applies to us and to our customers and, among other things, prohibits use of the Platform to send unsolicited commercial email in violation of applicable laws, and requires the inclusion in every email sent using the Platform of an “opt-out” mechanism and other required information. We require all of our customers to agree to adhere to the Acceptable Use Policy at all times, and any violations of the Acceptable Use Policy by a customer can result in immediate suspension or termination of the Platform.</p>
<p><strong>6.3. To Unsubscribe From Our Communications</strong><br>
You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our e-mails, or by sending us email us at support@thrivehive.com, or by sending us postal mail to ThriveHive, 222 Third Street, Suite 0234 Cambridge, MA 02142 USA, Attention: Privacy. Customers cannot opt out of receiving transactional emails related to their account with us or the Platform.</p>
<p><strong>6.4. To Unsubscribe from Our Customers’ Communications</strong><br>
