	<h2>ThreatFire.com Privacy Statement</h2>
	<h4>Last updated 2 July 2007</h4>
	<p>
		This policy sets out PC Tools Limited's and its affiliated companies (collectively, "PC Tools") privacy
		practices in connection with all of the products, services and websites offered by PC Tools (collectively,
		"services").
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have any questions about this policy, are concerned about how personal data is processed by PC
		Tools, or if you wish to receive a copy of any personal data which you may have supplied to PC Tools,
		please feel free to <a href="http://www.pctools.com/contact/">contact us</a> through our website or
		write to us at PC Tools Limited, c/- PO Box 1974, North Sydney NSW 2060, Australia.
	</p>
	<h4>General statement</h4>
	<p>
		PC Tools fully respects your right to privacy, and will not collect any personal information about you
		without your clear permission. Any personal information which you volunteer to PC Tools will be treated
		with the appropriate standards of security and confidentiality, strictly in accordance with the Data
		Protection Acts, 1988 &amp; 2003.
	</p>
	<h4>Collection and use of personal information</h4>
	<p>
		PC Tools does not collect any personal data about you on this website or in connection with any other
		service, apart from information which you volunteer (for example by e-mailing us, by purchasing a product
		from us, by downloading a product from us, or by registering your product with us, or by using our online
		feedback form). When you purchase a product from PC Tools, we may collect information including your
		contact details and credit card details. Please note that credit card information may be retained by us
		or our billing provider as a record of any transaction we undertake with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Information which you provide is used by PC Tools only in line with the purpose for which you provided
		it and will not be made available to third parties, other than information provided to us during the
		purchase process which may be provided to our online billing provider and our banking institution to
		enable the purchase to be processed. Please note that the transfer of information by us to such third
		parties may involve a transfer of that information to countries outside Ireland or the EU.
	</p>
	<p>
		If PC Tools has your email address, we may contact you by email to advise you of product updates,
		subscribe you to our newsletter or offer you PC Tools or third party products. You can opt out from
		receiving these emails at any time. Your preferences can be updated online by clicking here. PC Tools
		may also contact you in relation to customer support queries which you lodge.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your personal data may also be anonymised and used for statistical purposes.
	</p>
	<h4>Your rights regarding data supplied to PC Tools</h4>
	<p>
		You have a right to be given a copy of any personal data which you may have supplied to PC Tools in
		connection with any service. To exercise this right, you must contact us through our website or write
		to us at PC Tools Limited, c/- PO Box 1974, North Sydney NSW 2060, Australia. If you are contacting us
		by mail, you should include any personal identifiers which you supplied earlier (e.g. name, address,
		phone number, e-mail address). Your request will be dealt with as soon as possible and will take not
		more than 40 days to process.
	</p>
	<p>
		You also have a right to have any inaccurate information corrected. If you discover that PC Tools does
		hold inaccurate information about you, you have a right to instruct PC Tools to correct that information.
		Such instruction must be in writing or via e-mail. Your request will be dealt with as soon as possible
		and will take not more than 40 days to process.
	</p>
	<p>
		In certain circumstances you may also request that data which you have supplied to PC Tools be deleted.
		To exercise this right you would generally be expected to identify some contravention of data protection
		law in the manner in which PC Tools processes the data concerned. Please note that PC Tools may from time
		to time delete data which it holds about you or other persons where PC Tools considers it appropriate to
		do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are concerned about how personal data is processed by PC Tools, please do not hesitate to bring
		such concerns to the attention of PC Tools at the contact details set out above.
	</p>
	<h4>Collection and use of technical information</h4>
	<p>
		This website does use cookies — a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your
		computer to identify your browser – including temporary "session" cookies which enable a visitor's web
		browser to remember which pages on this website have already been visited and to track any referrer or
		affiliate information. Visitors can use this website with no substantial loss of functionality if cookies
		are disabled from the web browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		Technical details in connection with visits to our website may be logged by us or a third party for our
		statistical purposes and may also be used by our online billing provider to determine the purchase price
		during the purchase process. No information (apart from product purchase information) is collected that
		could be used by us to identify website visitors. The technical details logged are confined to the
		following types of information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the Internet Protocol address or gateway of the visitor's web server</li>
		<li>the previous website address from which the visitor reached us</li>
		<li>clickstream data which shows the traffic of visitors around this web site (for example pages accessed and documents downloaded)</li>
		<li>the type of web browser used by the visitor</li>
		<li>the operating system of the visitor's computer</li>
		<li>the screen resolution of the visitor's computer monitor.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive
		to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our
		customers like to see. Where a third party logs information on our behalf, we control how that data
		may and may not be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		PC Tools will make no attempt to identify individual visitors, or to associate the technical details
		listed above with any individual. It is PC Tools' policy never to disclose such technical information
		in respect of individual website visitors to any third party (apart from any third party providing
		services to us which may record such data on our behalf and which is bound by confidentiality provisions
		in this regard), unless obliged or permitted to disclose such information by a rule of law.
	</p>
	<p>
		The technical information will be used only by PC Tools, and only for statistical and other
		administrative purposes. You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any
		identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection
		Acts, 1988 &amp; 2003.
	</p>
	<h4>Other websites</h4>
	<p>
		PC Tools is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites accessible from this
		website via external links. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
		computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Any external links to other websites
		are clearly identifiable as such.
	</p>
	<h4>Changes to this policy</h4>
	<p>
		Please note that PC Tools may change this policy from time to time. Any amended policy terms will be
		posted to the PC Tools website.
