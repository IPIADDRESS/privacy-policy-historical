<p>We always hope you’re happy with your new purchase but just in case you’re not, we’ve set out below when you can return or exchange it. This will depend on where you bought it, and if you purchased directly from Three or another retailer.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you bought it from a Three Store: We’re sorry, but if you bought a Device or Accessory from a Three Store and you change your mind, you’ll be unable to return or exchange it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>If you bought it from Three Telesales or online at Three.co.uk: </b>If, within 14 days of receiving your purchase, you decide you want to return or exchange a Device or Accessory you can:&nbsp;</div>
<div>- call us on 333 (Free, unless you’re on one of our new Essential Plans, in which case it will come out of any available minutes allowance or charged at your out of allowance rate of 55p per minute) from your Phone or 0333 338 1001 (standard call charges apply) for Phone customers;&nbsp;or&nbsp;</div>
<div>- call 500 (free from a Three phone) or 0333 338 1003 from any other line (standard call charges apply) if you’re a Mobile Broadband (Dongle, Mobile Wi-Fi, Laptop or Tablet) customer.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Complete and return the Model Cancellation Form to us.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our Customer Contact Centre advisors will be able to help you immediately. There’s some important things to remember though:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
    <li>You can turn on and use your Device to inspect it and to make sure you’ve received what you thought you were buying, but if any damage is caused, or it is used beyond what’s reasonable, we have the right to charge you for any loss in value to the goods as a result of your use or damage. You’re allowed to do what is reasonable to ensure you’ve received what you thought you were buying and that it works as expected.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>You must not install “Find My iPhone” on your Apple device during the returns or exchanges period. If you do, and you fail to remove it before returning your Device to us, we’ll reduce your refund or apply a charge to your Three account by an amount of up to £200.</li>
    <li>You’ll also be charged for any Three Services you use before the end of your 14 day cancellation period (e.g. for any calls, texts or data used). Please remember that it can take up to 3 months for some international and premium rate services to be applied to your bill.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If you return a Device (or Accessory) to us, you will need to include not only the device, but any packaging, manuals, accessories and any “free” gifts supplied with the device.

<p>If you have All-you-can-eat data units as part of your package or with an Add-on, there are no hidden ‘fair use policies' when using your device within the UK. All-you-can-eat data units should give you all the access to the internet you would normally need, without worrying about hefty bills. Even if you used your phone for every minute of every day you'd only use, subject to TrafficSense™, around 1,000 GB each month. Certain usage, for example, for commercial purposes, isn't allowed under our Terms for Three Services, so we've set a usage cap at 1,000 GB, in order to help identify non-permitted use.</p>

<p>In addition to these All-you-can-eat UK allowances, you can use up to 15,360 data units (which converts into 15GB of data as 1 data unit converts automatically on use into 1MB of data) each month when in a Feel At Home in Europe destination unless you're a Pay As You Go customer with an Add-on that comes with All-you-can-eat data, in which case you can use up to 12,288 data units (which converts automatically on use into 12GB of data). Use over these Feel At Home in Europe Fair Use limits, but within your allowance, will be charged a surcharge of up to 0.50p per MB except if you are roaming in the following countries in which case it will be 0.41p/MB: Aland Islands, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, Reunion, Norway, Switzerland, Gibraltar, Iceland, Liechtenstein. If you reach your Fair Use limit (12GB) in a Feel at Home Around the World destination, you won't be able to use your plan abroad for the remainder of your current billing cycle.</p>


<p><strong>All-you-can-eat minutes &amp; texts</strong></p>
<p>There's no hidden "fair use policies" with our All-you-can-eat text units or voice units allowances when using your device in the UK or in our Feel At Home in Europe destinations - we just ask that you use this allowance in accordance with our Terms for Three Services - that is, for personal use only, and not for any illegal, commercial or improper purposes.</p>

<p>You can also use up to 5,000 text units and 3,000 voice units from your allowance to use respectively each month, when in a Feel At Home Around the World destination, which convert respectively into 5,000 text messages back to the UK and 3,000 minutes of calls to UK landline and mobile numbers.</p>

<p>When you're abroad in a Feel At Home destination, texts and calls to places other than the UK are chargeable - unless you're in a Feel At Home in Europe destination in which case you'll be able to use your allowances to make calls and send texts to numbers in other Feel At Home in Europe destinations at no extra cost. You'll be sent a text message on arrival in your destination, letting you know what charges apply when roaming there. They are also set out in your Price Guide.</p></div>

<p>Your use of the Home Signal box and service is subject to these terms as well as Three’s Terms of Service (<a href="http://www.three.co.uk/terms">www.three.co.uk/terms</a>).</p>
<p><br>
Please read through these terms and print a copy for yourself to keep in case you need them at any time.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you know, when we refer to<strong> "we"</strong>, <strong>"our" </strong>or <strong>"us"</strong> it means Hutchison 3G UK Limited, trading as “Three”.&nbsp; When we say <strong>"you"</strong> or "<strong>your"</strong>, we mean you, our Three customer who has registered their details with us as the main user of the Home Signal.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Does this change my contract for Three’s services?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong>No.&nbsp; This does not affect any of the services that we provide to you which are governed by Three’s Terms of Service.</p>
<p><br>
If there is any difference between what is said here and what is said in the Terms of Service, then what is said in the Terms of Service will prevail.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Before You Use the Home Signal </strong></p>
<p><br>
You must provide us with the address at which the Home Signal will be used, as well as your contact details if different.&nbsp; Your Home Signal has been provided for use in a residential address only and for security and technical reasons must only be used at the specified and agreed address for which it is provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
You must not give or sell your Home Signal box to anyone.&nbsp; Please tell us straight away if you think that the Home Signal box has been lost or stolen or if you believe that it is being used in an unauthorised manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
The Home Signal box is for use on the Three Network only and must only be used in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>How does the Home Signal Work?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong><i>Broadband</i></p>
<p><br>
The Home Signal uses your existing fixed line broadband connection.&nbsp; If you want more detail on how the Home Signal works, please go to <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/homesignal">www.three.co.uk/homesignal</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
If you don’t have a fixed broadband connection, Home Signal will not work.&nbsp; You have to plug the Home Signal box into the mains and your broadband router for it to work.&nbsp; For the Home Signal box to work properly, your broadband needs a download speed of 1Mbps or higher to make calls or send texts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check with your fixed broadband provider as to the speeds available in your location.</p>
<p><br>
The Home Signal box will use some of your home broadband data allowance (click here to see how much <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/homesignal">www.three.co.uk/homesignal</a>).&nbsp; As with all of your broadband use, you are solely responsible for the cost of using your broadband.&nbsp; The speed of your broadband connection may be affected if you use the Home Signal to consume large quantities of data on the Three Network.</p>
<p><br>
You can continue to access the internet on your handset or other mobile devices using your Wi-Fi connection, even if you’re using the Home Signal box for calls and texts. Please be aware that if you use the Home Signal box to access the internet or consume data via the Home Signal, you will be using some of your Three data allowance as well as that of your broadband provider.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If your broadband connection fails, your Home Signal service will also fail and you may not be able to make calls or send texts.&nbsp; Your service will also cease to function if there is a power cut or failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<i>Broadband Issues?</i></p>
<p><br>
If you have any problems or questions about your broadband, you should contact your fixed broadband provider as we cannot provide any technical support or advice with regard to your broadband.</p>
<p><br>
Three cannot guarantee that the Home Signal will be compatible with your broadband modem/router, but this should not be a problem for the vast majority of people as the Home Signal box uses a common Ethernet connection to connect to your modem/router which is a ‘standard’ socket.</p>
<p><br>
It is possible that your broadband provider may install systems or programmes outside of our control to stop Home Signal working and in this event, we suggest you contact your broadband supplier.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can of course offer you advice or answer your questions on the Home Signal itself.&nbsp; Please go to <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/homesignal">www.three.co.uk/homesignal</a> to see how to contact us about Home Signal and to find out more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Setting Up the Home Signal box</strong></p>
<p><br>
The Home Signal box is simple to set up.&nbsp; Please refer to the ‘Getting Started Guide’ supplied with the Home Signal box for full installation guidelines and make sure that you read all instructions, safety and security information before installing the Home Signal box.</p>
<p><br>
It is your responsibility to install the Home Signal box as well as to provide a power supply and fixed line broadband connection.</p>
<p><br>
You must continue to use your existing SIM in your mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong><i>Who owns what?</i></p>
<p><br>
Three retain ownership of the Home Signal Box.&nbsp; You will be required to send it back to Three if you ever decide to leave and terminate your contract with us.&nbsp; It is really important you do this otherwise you will be charged for the cost of replacement plus any reasonable failed collection charges.</p>
<p><br>
The software in the Home Signal box and all intellectual property rights in that software is owned by the manufacturer and you’re being allowed to use the software on a limited licence from the manufacturer You mustn’t permit your Home Signal to be unlocked via any unauthorised manner.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Using the Home Signal</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong>The Home Signal is provided at our discretion, and is based on a number of factors.&nbsp; Please contact Three to see if you are eligible.&nbsp; If you are eligible, then we will provide one (1) Home Signal box per property.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
The Home Signal may only be used for domestic and private use and it must not be used for any commercial or business use.</p>
<p><br>
Your Home Signal box is for use only in accordance with this document and the Home Signal Box may not be used for any illegal or fraudulent purpose or in any way which we believe has harmed or may harm the security or proper functioning of the Three Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
If for any reason you are unable to use the Home Signal box, you still have to continue to comply with your Terms of Service, and to pay any charges when they become due.</p>
<p><br>
Three may suspend or disconnect your Home Signal service without notice if you are using the Home Signal in a way that is contrary to these terms and for any of the reasons set out in Three’s Terms of Service (<a href="http://www.three.co.uk/terms">www.three.co.uk/terms</a>).</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Emergency Calls and 999</strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
</strong>You will not be able to make calls to the emergency services using the Home Signal if it is not supplied with enough power, for example if there is a power cut or failure, or if there is a failure or disruption in the service of your broadband connection.</p>
<p><br>
We or the emergency services may use the details you give us when registering your Home Signal box to identify your location or the location of others calling via the Home Signal box if calls are made to the emergency services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
This is why you must tell us your contact details and the location of the Home Signal box accurately and inform us straight away if those details change at all.&nbsp; If the address at which the Home Signal box is going to be used changes, for example if you move home, you must ensure that you notify us of your new address immediately as we will need to register the Home Signal box to your new address.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>What is Three’s Liability to you (and how is it limited)?</strong></p>
<p><br>
All of our obligations to you relating to the Home Signal are set out in this document and Three’s Terms of Service.&nbsp; Those Terms of Service contain details on how we limit our liability to you (<a href="http://www.three.co.uk/terms">www.three.co.uk/terms</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
We are also not liable for any third party claims, any claims arising out of or relating to your broadband supply or any claims from any other users of the Home Signal box. We are not liable for any loss or damage that was not reasonably foreseeable when you were supplied with your Home Signal box.</p>
<p><br>
Nothing in Three’s Terms of Service or these terms removes or limits our liability for fraud, for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for any liability which can’t be limited or excluded by applicable law.&nbsp; If you are a consumer, these terms will not affect any of your statutory rights which you have, which cannot be excluded by these terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>

<p><br>
Three provides a limited warranty to the first end-user of the Home Signal box who received the Home Signal from an authorised seller. Please contact us for a copy of this Warranty if needed.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>What’s expected of you.</strong></div>
<div>6. We expect you to comply with our standard Terms for Three services, our <a href="http://www.three.co.uk//Privacy_Cookies/Your_privacy?site=d"> Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/_standalone/Link_Document?content_aid=1220457052786">Acceptable Use Policy.</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>21. We may also anonymise and bundle together your usage data and share it with third parties. These third parties may use it for marketing purposes, like improving their targeting of advertising. Other than this, the only time we would share your data with any third parties would be if we were required to pass it on for legal or regulatory reasons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Our liability to you.</strong></div>
<div>22. Our liability to you is limited as set out in this agreement. Except as set out in paragraph 24:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>26. If you do anything over this service that requires you to follow any other rules or sign up to any other terms and conditions, we can’t be responsible for this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>27. This agreement is personal to you and cannot be transferred. For business reasons we may transfer any of our rights and responsibilities under this agreement without your permission.&nbsp;</div>

<p>We’re always working to improve our network, and by the end of this year our customers will have an even bigger, better, faster network. At the same time customer usage of our Mobile Broadband services is increasing dramatically.</p>
<p>We want all our Mobile Broadband customers to have the best possible internet experience, so there are certain things we need to do to make sure it meets your needs.</p>

<p><strong>What happens at busy times?</strong></p>
<p>We carefully manage the traffic on our Mobile Broadband network so that everyone has a fair share of the service. So in an area with a particularly high number of people using the internet (and during busy times like 6pm to midnight) we may manage the speed of things like file sharing, software updates and some download activity which can slow down our service. This activity might feel slower than usual during these times. The majority of our customers, who are simply browsing the internet, won’t be affected. </p>

<p>If you have concerns about the quality of your coverage or need technical support, please call 0333 300 0500 from any UK landline (calls will come out of any inclusive voice allowance on the Three network or may cost 5.1p per minute otherwise), or if you have a Three mobile call 500 for free. See how our network is improving at three.co.uk/network. </p></div>

<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>Calls to Service Numbers&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">Calls to Services Numbers are those that start with 084, 087, 09 or 118. The cost of these calls are split into two charges – an Access Charge (which we set, at 45p per minute, and is charged by the minute) and a Service Charge (which is set by the company you’re calling – they’ll tell you this).</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>Voicemail</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">Voicemail is charged at 3p per minute whilst in the UK or our Feel at Home in Europe destinations. See Price Guide for voicemail charges whilst overseas in other destinations.&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>Top-ups</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">Where a Top-up is bought in-store and a 16-digit code provided, the Top-up needs to be activated within 90 days of buying it. Once activated, Top-ups have no expiry date, unless there is no activity at all on an account for 180 days as Three reserves the right to terminate or suspend unused accounts.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">Where there are free allowances with a Top-up they are always used first. If you’ve bought an Add-on, this allowance is used next followed by your cash credit.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">Your top-up is for use in the UK as well as in our Feel At Home Around the World destinations, at no extra cost.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>Starter Top-up Credit &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">New customers who have purchased a handset or SIM only with a pre-loaded Starter Top-Up, your Top-Up, once activated, has no expiry date, unless there’s no activity at all on your account for 180 days, in which case Three reserves the right to terminate or suspend unused accounts.&nbsp; New customers who have purchased a handset or a SIM only with an All-in-One Add-on will need to use the Add-on within 30 days of activation (activation occurs at the first chargeable usage event).</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>SIM only&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">You may have received a message from Three advising you to switch your SIM to a Three mobile, as you may have been using it in a 2G handset which is not compatible on our network. We want you to continue to use Three's great services, so you need to use it in a 3G or 4G enabled mobile.</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>Texts</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">Inclusive anytime, any network text messages are standard text messages sent within the UK to other standard UK mobiles or between Feel At Home in Europe destinations to standard mobiles. Each text message can accommodate 160 characters. Some handsets allow for more. Messages exceeding the limit will be divided and sent in numerous messages (depending on length), with each message being charged at the standard rates or deducted from your credit.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm"><strong>Add-ons</strong></div>
<div style="margin: 5pt 0cm">To convert a Top-up to an Add-on, you need to have an active Top-up. Once an Add-on is activated, it is valid for 30 days. Activation starts as soon as you have converted a Top-up to an Add-on. After 30 days, any inclusive allowance will be lost. An exception to this 30 day rule is the Internet Daily Pass, which is valid for 24 hours. Add-ons are non-refundable. Three reserves the right to suspend, modify or withdraw Add-ons, without notice, at any time.</div>

They’re designed to provide you with an allowance of voice, text and/or data units (depending on the Add-on chosen) which you can use in the UK or in our Feel At Home destinations, for calling, texting and getting online.</p>
<p>Our Pay As You Go Add-ons are valid for 30 days (unless used up earlier) from the date and time they’re activated by you – except for the Internet Daily Add-on which lasts for 24 hours. Your Add-on must be activated within 90 days’ of purchase. This can be done within your My3 account.</p>
<p>Once an Add-on has been activated, it can’t be cancelled. Once the 30 days are up (or the 24 hours in the case of Internet Daily), any unused allowance of units will be lost and won’t be rolled over to another Add-on.</p>
<p>If your Add-on includes an allowance of voice units, which convert on use automatically into minutes, these can be used to call standard UK landlines (starting 01, 02 and 03), UK Mobiles (any network) and your Three voicemail, whether you’re in the UK or one of our Feel At Home destinations. If you're in a Feel At Home in Europe destination, you'll also be able to use your add-on allowance to make standard landline or mobile calls between Feel At Home in Europe destinations. If your Add-on voice allowance runs out during a call, the remainder of the call will be charged at our standard rate of 3p per minute.</p>
<p>Your Add-on text unit allowance can’t be used for messages sent abroad from the UK, messages sent and received whilst abroad (unless in a Feel At Home destination), photo and video messages or for messages to a shortcode service e.g. to donate money to a charity. In any Feel At Home destination you can use your text allowance to text back to the UK while if you're in a Feel At Home in Europe destination you can also use it to text other mobiles in Feel At Home in Europe destinations.</p>
<p>Three reserves the right to suspend, change, rename or withdraw Add-ons, without notice, at any time.</p>

<div id="pay-monthly-add-ons" class="" data-document-id="pay-monthly-add-ons" data-ng-show="selected.document == &quot;pay-monthly-add-ons&quot;"><div class=""><h2 class="">Pay Monthly Add-ons</h2><div class=""><p>We offer a range of daily, short-term and long-term Add-ons on our pay monthly and SIM plans. The Add-ons that will be available to buy depend on your plan. The full details of each, and their pricing, can be found in your <a title="Three Price Guides" href="/terms-conditions/price-guides">price guide</a>.</p>
<p>They’re designed to provide you with an extra allowance of units to your inclusive allowance (for voice or data, depending on the Add-on chosen) which you can use in the UK and in our Feel At Home destinations, for calling and getting online unless you’re on one of our new Three Essential plans  in which case, your extra allowance of units can only be used in the UK and in our Feel At Home in Europe destinations. 
</p>
<p>If your Add-on includes an allowance of voice units, which convert on use automatically into minutes, these can be used to:

</p><ul>
<li> call standard UK landlines (starting 01, 02 and 03), UK Mobiles (any network) and your Three voicemail, whether you’re in the UK or one of our Feel At Home destinations (unless you’re on an Essential plan in which case it’s for use in the UK or Feel At Home in Europe destinations only).</li>
<li>If you're in a Feel At Home in Europe destination you'll also be able to make calls to standard "local" numbers, between our Feel At Home in Europe destinations, at no extra cost.</li>
</ul> 

If your Add-on voice allowance runs out during a call, the remainder of the call will be charged at our standard out of allowance rate, as stated in your Price Guide.<p></p>
<p>We have the right to suspend, change or withdraw Add-ons, without notice, at any time.</p>
<p></p><h3>Daily Add-ons</h3><p></p>
<p>Where available, these can be purchased once every 24 hours, and will expire at midnight on the day of purchase. Included in our Daily Add-on range is our Data Passport which is available for £5 a day in the UK and 78 worldwide destinations (including all of our Feel At Home destinations). If you use a lot of data or just want the best internet experience, the Data Passport was designed for you. It provides an additional unlimited, unrestricted data allowance that can be used in the UK or 78 destinations around the world, for a calendar day, allowing you to use your device as much as you like whether that’s as a personal hotspot, or to browse, stream audio or video in high definition, or connect to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It expires at midnight (UK time) on the day of purchase. For more information see <a href="http://support.three.co.uk/SRVS/CGI-BIN/WEBISAPI.DLL?Command=New,Kb=Mobile,Ts=Mobile,T=Article,varset_cat=roaming,varset_subcat=4157,Case=obj(41736)">Data Passport support</a>.</p>
<p></p><h3>Short-term Add-ons</h3><p></p>
<p>These are designed to allow you to increase your data or minute allowance, on a one-off short-term basis, until your monthly allowance refreshes (unless we tell you otherwise). Each Short-term Add-on can be purchased once each month, and, if not used up first, will last until the end of the bill cycle you’re in when you buy it. It will then drop-off your account automatically. Any unused allowance will be lost and won’t be rolled over to the following month.</p>
<p></p><h3>Long-term Add-ons</h3><p></p>
<p>These are designed to provide you with a new or increased monthly allowance, every month on an on-going basis. It will be applied automatically each month to your account, until you give us one-month notice that you’d like it removed. Any unused allowance will be lost and won’t be rolled over to the following month.</p></div>

    ✔ Make a claim, ideally within 30 days of discovering that your device is

    Write: <strong>Three Rescue™, PO Box 71012, LONDON W4 9FW.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. Eligibility.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can take this cover if you’re over 18, your device is worth more than
    £125 and you haven’t had a mobile insurance policy declined by us or
    cancelled by us in the past or a claim denied due to fraud. You can only
    buy, remain on, and make a claim with Three Rescue™ Damage Cover if you and
    the main authorised user of the device live permanently in the UK. If at
    any time you or the authorised user are no longer going to be resident in
    the UK, you need to contact us using the details above and let us know. We
    will cancel your cover if you no longer meet this criteria.
</p>
<p>
    You can buy Three Rescue™Damage Cover when you buy or upgrade your device
    and Pay Monthly plan with Three. Cover starts when your device is in your
    hands. If you pre-order a device from Three and buy Three Rescue™ cover
    you’ll be refunded the cost of any Three Rescue™ premium paid in the period
    between ordering and receiving your new device.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>C. Period of cover.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your insurance premium is due monthly from when the device is in your
    hands. Subject to continued payment of insurance premium and these terms
    and conditions, this policy renews automatically each month for the next 59
    months after which we will automatically cancel it, unless cover is
    terminated earlier in accordance with Section I below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>D. What’s covered?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The device registered to your Three account which is purchased from or
    upgraded with Three and is shown in your welcome letter (or the replacement
    device, if replaced by us, or replaced under manufacturer warranty).
</p>
<p>
    With Three Rescue™ Damage Cover you’re covered if you lend your device to
    friends and family.
</p>
<p>
    You are covered whilst travelling overseas but any replacement agreed after
    you make a successful claim can only be delivered to an address in the UK
    or the Channel Islands.
</p>
<p>
    You can submit a claim online 24/7 at <a href="https://www.threerescue.co.uk/start" title="threerescue.co.uk/start">Three Rescue</a> or by
    phone - see Section G: Make a claim.
</p>
<p>
    We aim to deliver your replacement next-day if your claim is approved
    before 8.30pm Monday to Friday or 2.30pm on weekends.
</p>
<p>
    Any replacement device you receive may be refurbished to our ‘as new’
    standard using original equipment manufacturer parts. In the unlikely event
    we can’t send you a same model replacement, we’ll offer you a different
    make, model or colour device with comparable features and functionality.
</p>

    <strong>E. What’s not covered?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It’s important you know that you’re not covered for:
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any device other than one purchased from Three and shown on your welcome
    letter unless replaced by us or replaced under manufacturer warranty.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any claim for loss or theft.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any claim if you haven’t paid your insurance premium. Provided we haven’t
    yet cancelled your policy for non-payment, we’ll continue your claim if you
    pay the outstanding amount.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ The claim excess fee you have to pay to complete a successful claim.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ A third or subsequent claim made within a 12-month period.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any fault that happens within the manufacturer’s warranty period (where
    the manufacturer covers you against certain operating failures).
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Accessory-only claims.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Accessories other than the battery, mains charger and hands-free kit that
    came in the box with your device.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ The costs of any calls, texts, data usage or downloads.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Cosmetic damage - where the device works as normal, except where you are
    claiming for a cracked screen.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Damage caused by making alterations to the device or acting against
    manufacturer guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any malicious or deliberate damage to the device caused by you or someone
    who has your permission to use it.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ The cost of any repair to your device unless we instruct it.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any losses or consequences you face as a result of being without your
    device.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Confiscation of your device by a finance company or government agency
    (such as the police).
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Loss or corruption of any kind of app, software or digital content other
    than standard manufacturer software.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any claim that we find to be fraudulent. If we settle a claim that’s
    later found to be fraudulent we may take action to recover our costs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>F. The cost.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When considering your new device and Pay Monthly plan with Three, we’ll
    tell you what it costs to buy Three Rescue™ Damage Cover based on the make,
    model and value of your chosen device at that time.
</p>
<p>
    Please look out for your Three Rescue™ Damage Cover welcome letter which
    includes your full terms and conditions and confirms your monthly premium,
    type of cover and claim excess fee - which is the amount you have to pay
    towards the cost of your replacement device to complete a claim.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ Your monthly premium will appear on your Three account (shown on your
    Three bill under ‘other charges’) and any pro-rated adjustments to cover
    your device for the period up to your first bill. Insurance premiums are
    inclusive of insurance premium tax (IPT) at the applicable rate.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ Three Rescue™ Damage Cover premium is collected and refunds are made by
    Three, on behalf of the Insurer. When Three passes the premium to Asurion,
    they hold it on behalf of the Insurer and any payments collected and
    refunds made by Asurion under these terms and conditions are collected or
    refunded on behalf of the Insurer.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ You need to make the first month’s payment before we can complete any
    claim.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ If we don’t receive a payment, your cover will finish at the end of the
    paid-for period. If your Three account is in arrears, we won’t settle any
    claim until the balance is paid in full. You have 30 days from when your
    account goes into arrears to make a catch up payment, after which we will
    cancel your cover.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ You need to pay the claim excess fee to complete any successful claim. As
    devices age they may fall in value and so from time to time we may adjust
    the claim excess fees downwards. You can call us to find out your current
    claim excess fee.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ You can cancel cover at any time – see Section I for details.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>G. Make a claim.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If something happens to your device and you need to make a claim, contact
    us via one of these options:
</p>
<p>
    1. Submit your claim online 24/7 at
    <a href="http://www.threerescue.co.uk/start">
        www.ThreeRescue.co.uk/start
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    2. Claim by phone using the contact details set out in Section A above.
</p>
<p>
    Please have a payment card ready to pay your claim excess fee. We accept
    MasterCard and Visa debit or credit cards.
</p>
<p>
    If you report a claim to us more than 90 days after discovering the damage
    or out-of-warranty breakdown, we will still consider your claim, but it may
    affect our ability to assess your claim and could, in some cases, result in
    it being declined.
</p>
<p>
    We will ask you to provide relevant information to support your claim. In
    some cases, we may also ask you to complete a written claim statement
    and/or provide evidence of your identity.
</p>
<p>
    You must take reasonable care to ensure that any information provided to us
    is complete and accurate. If you don’t provide accurate or full information
    when requested, it may invalidate your insurance and could affect all or
    part of your claim. Information about fraudulent claims may be forwarded to
    the police, government or other regulatory bodies and fraud investigation
    agencies.
</p>
<p>
    You must comply with our reasonable instructions including switching off or
    uninstalling any app, personal PIN locks or operator specific security
    locks which prevents our access to remove data from the claimed-for device.
    If you need any help with this please call us on 0333 338 1001*. If you
    refuse to do it, we will not continue or complete your claim. If you fail
    to do it we will treat this as a non-return and may charge you a non-return
    fee.
</p>
<p>
    As part of our claim assessment process, you consent to us checking your
    airtime usage with Three to detect potential insurance fraud. We have the
    right to check for any attempted use of a lost or stolen device and will
    take action to recover it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>H. About your replacement device.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the unlikely event that we can’t send you a same model replacement,
    we’ll offer you a different make, model or colour device with comparable
    features and functionality.
</p>
<p>
    We will only deliver to addresses in the UK and the Channel Islands. Please
    see below for details of our delivery promise.
</p>
<p>
    We aim to send a next-day ‘as new’ replacement for claims approved before
    8.30pm Monday to Friday or 2.30pm on weekends. For claims approved outside
    of those times we’ll deliver your ‘as new’ replacement within 2 days. This
    excludes:
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Claims made or deliveries that fall on a UK Bank Holiday.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any delivery outside of mainland Great Britain, including deliveries to
    the Scottish Islands, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands.
</p>
<p>
    ✘ Any delay caused by something outside our control like extreme weather,
    natural disaster, epidemic or crime, and supply shortages affecting the
    industry (e.g. where new model devices are in very high demand and short
    supply after launch).
</p>
<p>
    If you think we’re late please let us know and if we have missed our
    delivery promise, we’ll give you £20 paid to the payment card used to pay
    your claim excess fee within 30 days.
</p>
<p>
    Please make sure someone is in to sign for the delivery. Your replacement
    device comes with:
</p>
<p>
    ✔ A 24-month warranty.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ The usual device accessories if yours were involved in the incident, or
    if we provide you with a different model replacement.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ A new SIM with the same phone number if requested; in which case your old
    SIM will be blocked.
</p>
<p>
    ✔ Pre-paid packaging to return your damaged or faulty device (minus the
    SIM, battery and charger).
</p>
<p>
    As soon as you receive your replacement device, the original claimed-for
    device (the faulty or damaged device), becomes the property of the Insurer
    and must be returned to us within 15 days. Otherwise, we’ll charge a
    non-return fee (based on the market value of the non-returned model), to
    the payment card used to pay your claim excess fee. The device is your
    responsibility until it arrives with us. Please make sure you get proof of
    postage from the Post Office (this is a free service), and confirmation of
    the weight of the package you are returning to us. We won’t approve any
    further claims until you have returned the claimed-for device or paid the
    outstanding amount.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I. Cancelling your cover.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can call, email or write to us to cancel your Three Rescue™ Damage
    Cover, see Section A for contact details.
</p>
<p>
    You can cancel within the first 28 days and if you haven’t made a claim,
    you’ll receive a refund of any premium paid. Please call us if you have any
    questions about your cancellation.
</p>
<p>
    After 28 days of your purchase, you can cancel at any time and cover will
    finish at the end of the paid-for period. We will not refund any premium
    paid.
</p>
<p>
    When you upgrade your device or buy another device on the same mobile
    number, we’ll cancel cover on your old device automatically. If you add
    insurance for your new device, we’ll set up a policy for the new device and
    confirm your cover start date, premium and claim excess in writing.
</p>
<p>
    We’ll cancel your policy if you fail to pay the monthly insurance premium,
    have two successful claims in any 12-month period or if you make a claim we
    find to be fraudulent. We’ll also cancel your policy if your Pay Monthly
    contract with Three terminates, unless you and we agree to continue cover
    when you change to a different airtime plan. If we cancel your policy,
    we’ll send you written confirmation, including your cover end date.
</p>
<p>
    We may also cancel your policy if it is no longer economically viable to
    provide this product or if we, or the insurer, withdraw from the market of
    providing policies of this type in the UK. If this happens we’ll give you
    at least 30 days’ notice sent to the current contact details we have for
    you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>J. Changes to the policy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may change your policy terms or alter the premium or claim excess fees
    for future periods of cover based on significant adverse claims experience,
    significant increase in our operating costs, inflation, economic and
    environmental factors, and changes in legislation, taxation or interest
    rates. If we make a change that increases any charges or reduces your
    cover, we’ll give you at least 30 days’ notice sent to the current contact
    details we have for you. You will be able to cancel your policy if you are
    not happy with our changes. If we make any change that improves your cover,
    we may apply it straight away without notice. This does not affect your
    statutory right to cancel at any time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>K. How to complain.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can call, email or write to us to make a complaint - see Section A for
    contact details.
</p>
<p>
    If we can’t resolve your complaint right away, we’ll email or write to you
    within five working days to outline our next steps. If the issue still
    isn’t resolved within two weeks, we’ll contact you again to keep you up to
    speed on what’s happening.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re not happy with the outcome or we haven’t given our final response
    within 8 weeks of your raising your complaint, you can contact The
    Financial Ombudsman Service by phone: 0800 023 4567 (Freephone) or 0300 123
    9123, by email: <a href="mailto:complaint.info@financial-ombudsman.org.uk" title="complaint.info@financial-ombudsman.org.uk">complaint.info@financial-ombudsman.org.uk</a> or in writing at
    Exchange Tower, London, E14 9SR. You need to contact them within 6 months
    of receiving our final decision. The service is free and we are bound by
    any decision the Financial Ombudsman reaches. This won’t affect your
    statutory rights or prejudice your right to take subsequent legal
    proceedings. You can find out more at <a href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk" title="financial-ombudsman.org.uk">financial-ombudsman.org.uk</a>

    We may collect the below types of personal information:
</p>
<p>
    Name;
</p>
<p>
    • Mailing address;
</p>
<p>
    • Email address;
</p>
<p>
    • Mobile phone number and information that identifies your mobile device,
    such as an IMEI;
</p>
<p>
    • Information collected after obtaining your permission;
</p>
<p>
    • Any information that you provide as part of filing a claim;

<p>
    • Information provided by your mobile network provider to validate your
    claim;
</p>
<p>
    • Other information that personally identifies you or is linked or linkable
    to you.
</p>
<p>
    As part of the claim process, Asurion or its affiliates may require you to
    provide a copy of your driver’s license, passport or other forms of
    identification. Additionally, in order to process your claim, Asurion or
    its affiliates may request your shipping and billing information, credit
    card information or other preferred payment means.
</p>
<p>
    We will not use or disclose your personal information to third parties
    except as disclosed in this policy.
</p>
<p>
    Asurion may transfer your personal information to:
</p>
<p>
    • Non-affiliated companies that include telecommunication carriers, credit
    card payment processors, security services providers, service providers who
    send communications on our behalf and third parties providing claims
    fulfilment, supply chain logistics, data centre operations, information
    technology, customer service and quality assurance monitoring of customer
    service. These companies are required to comply with the principles set out
    in this policy and only use such personal information for the purposes for
    which it was provided to them;
</p>
<p>
    • A third-party, in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale
    (including a liquidation, realisation, foreclosure or repossession), lease,
    merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer,
    conveyance or financing of all or any portion of its business or of any
    assets or shares of our business or a division thereof in order for you to
    continue to receive the same or similar products and services from the
    third-party. In these circumstances, personal information may be shared
    with the actual or prospective purchasers or assignees, or with the newly
    acquired business.
</p>
<p>
    To determine the appropriate period which we will keep your personal
    information before we securely destroy it, we consider the amount, nature,
    and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm
    from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the
    purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can
    achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it
    can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such
    information without further notice to you.
</p>
<p>
    Our services are not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal
    information from, individuals under the age of 18. If a child is accessing
    services without your consent, please contact us by using the information
    provided below so that we can remove any personal information provided.
</p>
<p>
    Personal information we collect from you may be processed by Asurion and
    third-parties as described in this policy in the United States and other
    countries and used consistent with your relationship with Asurion and the
    practices described in this policy.
</p>
<p>
    Personal information will only be transferred to locations outside of the
    UK and the EU where permissible legal structures exist or where the country
    is deemed “adequate” by the EU Commission.
</p>
<p>
    We have implemented technical and organisational measures designed to
    provide appropriate levels of security for your personal data. Reasonable
    administrative, logical, and physical controls are in place to prevent your
    personal information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in
    unauthorized ways.
</p>
<p>
    While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your
    personal information, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete
    personal information when interacting with us.
</p>
<p>
    Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly
    known as a ‘data subject access request’). This enables you to receive a
    copy of the personal information we hold about you.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Request correction</strong> of any incomplete or inaccurate
    personal information that we hold about you.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information when there
    is no need for us continuing to process it or you have exercised your right
    to object to processing (see below).
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where
    we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
    there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
    object to processing on this ground.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal
    information to suspend the processing, for example if you want us to verify
    its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to
    another party.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact the Data
    Protection Officer in writing per the ‘Where to turn with questions’
    details in this section. Valid requests will be honored within 30 calendar
    days of request. This 30-day period may be extended for another 2 months
    for complex requests with notification of the reasons for the extension to
    you. Any such requests should be submitted to the Data Protection Officer.
</p>
<p>
    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to
    exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee
    if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may
    refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. In addition, there
    may be requests that we are unable process because of other EU legal
    requirements. If a request is denied, we will notify of the reason.
</p>
<p>
    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
    your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to
    exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security
    measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person
    who has no right to receive it.
</p>
<p>
    You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information
    Commissioner’s Office or other EU supervisory authority. However, if you
    have a complaint regarding the processing of your personal information, we
    request that you first contact the Asurion Data Protection Officer as
    indicated in the Where to turn with questions section of this policy and we
    will reply promptly.

    <strong>4. How to claim </strong>
</p>
<p>
    To claim your Upgrade, text “UPGRADE” to <strong>88555</strong> together
    with the following information in the following order:
</p>
<p>
    </p><p style="margin-left: 40px">1. The easyJet ‘EZY’ flight number for your outbound flight;
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    </p><p style="margin-left: 40px">2. The date of your outbound flight; and

<p>
    </p><p style="margin-left: 40px">3. Your surname (as it appears on your Passport),
</p>
<p>
    (together a “<strong>Redemption Request</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    If you do not submit the above information correctly or completely you may
    not receive your Upgrade.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What you will receive</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you are eligible and submit a valid Redemption Request, our
    Administrator will send an SMS response which will be your electronic
    voucher (“<strong>Voucher</strong>”) to claim your Upgrade.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re not eligible or you submit an invalid Redemption Request you will
    not receive a Voucher. Rather, our Administrator will send an SMS response
    with a link to further information.
</p>
<p>
    We will endeavour to send these as quickly as possible but we cannot
    guarantee that they will be instantly sent as it may take our
    Administrator’s systems a little time to receive and process your request.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. How to Redeem</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Redeeming your Upgrade is simple. All you need to do is show your Voucher
    to an easyJet representative at the easyJet Bag Drop desk. The easyJet
    representative will confirm the validity of your Voucher and take you
    through how to use your Upgrade (see below).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Upgrade</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your Upgrade is only valid for the <strong>outbound</strong> easyJet flight
    from a UK airport that you have submitted in your Redemption Request. The
    Upgrade can only be used for one cabin bag. Full details of easyJet’s Hands
    Free service (and any limits and restrictions) can be found at
    <a href="http://www.easyjet.com/en/hands-free-upgrade">
        http://www.easyJet.com/en/hands-free-upgrade
    </a>
    . To summarise how it works: <strong></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Present your Voucher to an easyJet representative at the easyJet Bag Drop 
desk.</li>
<li>Drop off your cabin bag at the easyJet Bag Drop desk.</li>
<li>Receive your Three branded tote bag for your personal belongings.</li>
<li>Pass through security.</li>
<li>Board first after the Speedy Boarding passengers.</li>

<li>Receive your bag at the destination, which will be amongst the first to 
be delivered to the baggage belt.</li>

</ul>
<p>
    <strong>7. Exclusions and Limitations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your Upgrade is valid for outbound flights from UK airports only. If you
    wish to use the easyJet Hands Free service on your return flight you will
    need to arrange this with easyJet and you will be charged at easyJet’s
    current price (£6 as at the date of publication of these terms).
</p>
<p>
    Only one Voucher per valid Redemption Request will be provided. The Voucher
    is personal to you and is not transferable. easyJet’s Hands Free group
    bundle is not currently included.
</p>
<p>
    The Upgrade is subject to easyJet’s Hands Free terms and conditions which
    can be accessed from
    <a href="http://www.easyjet.com/en/hands-free-upgrade">
        http://www.easyjet.com/en/hands-free-upgrade
    </a>
    , which are beyond Three’s control. For example, easyJet’s terms state that
    your cabin bag must be within easyJet’s normal maximum dimensions (56 x 45
    x 25cm (including handles and wheels) as at the date of publication of
    these terms). Please ensure that you have read and understood these terms
    prior to travel.

<p><strong>Unlimited</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unlimited data</strong></p>
<p>If you have Unlimited data units as part of your package or with an Add-on, there are no hidden ‘fair use policies’ when using your device within the UK. Unlimited units should give you all the access to the internet you would normally need, without worrying about hefty bills. Even if you used your phone for every minute of every day you’d only use, subject to TrafficSense™, around 1,000 GB each month. Certain usage, for example, for commercial purposes, isn’t allowed under our Terms for Three Services, so we’ve set a usage cap at 1,000 GB, in order to help identify non-permitted use.</p>
<p>In addition to these Unlimited UK allowances, if you are a Pay Monthly customer you can use up to 15,360 data units (which converts into 15GB of data as 1 data unit converts automatically on use into 1MB of data) each month when in a Go Roam in Europe destination. If you’re a Pay As You Go customer with an Unlimited Add-on, you can use up to 12,288 data units (which converts automatically into 12GB of data). Use over these Go Roam in Europe Fair Use limits, but within your allowance, will be charged a surcharge of up to 0.50p per MB except if you are roaming in the following countries in which case it will be 0.41p/MB: Aland Islands, French Guiana, Gibraltar, Guadeloupe, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Martinique, Mayotte, Norway, Réunion and Switzerland. If you reach your Fair Use limit (12GB) in a Go Roam Around the World destination, you won’t be able to use your plan abroad for the remainder of your current billing cycle, or end of your active add-on if you are a PAYG customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unlimited minutes &amp; texts</strong></p>
<p>There’s no hidden “fair use policies” with our Unlimited text units or voice units allowances when using your device in the UK or in our Go Roam in Europe destinations – we just ask that you use this allowance in accordance with our Terms for Three Services – that is, for personal use only, and not for any illegal, commercial or improper purposes.</p>
<p>For our Pay Monthly plans you can also use up to 5,000 text units and 3,000 voice units from your allowance each month, when in a Go Roam Around the World destination, which convert respectively into 5,000 text messages back to the UK and 3,000 minutes of calls to UK landline and mobile numbers.For our Pay As You Go customers with an Unlimited Add-on, you can use up to 43,200 texts units and 43,200 voice units from your 30-day allowance when you’re in a Go Roam Around the World destination, which convert respectively into 43,200 text messages back to the UK and 43,200 minutes of calls to UK landline and mobile numbers.When you’re abroad in a Go Roam destination, texts and calls to places other than the UK are chargeable – unless you’re in a Go Roam in Europe destination in which case you’ll be able to use your allowances to make calls and send texts to numbers in other Go Roam in Europe destinations at no extra cost. You’ll be sent a text message on arrival in your destination, letting you know what charges apply when roaming there. They are also set out in your Price Guide.</p></div>

<p><span class="bold">The Trade In Instant Reward Card</span></p>
<p>5.  The Card can only be used in participating Three retail stores in the UK. </p>
<p>6.  The value of the Card can be applied to the up-front cost of a Samsung Galaxy S8, S9, or Note 9 (a “<span class="bold">Qualifying Device</span>”) or to spend in participating Three retail stores on accessories. For the avoidance of doubt, using the Card means you will pay a reduced up-front fee for a Qualifying Device, but will pay the monthly recurring charge for 24 months. </p>
<p>7.  Any refunds are subject to the contract you take out with Three for a Qualifying Device. If your device is determined to be faulty and you elect not to swap this for a new Qualifying Device you will not be entitled to receive back the full value of your Card as cash or in-store credit, your Card will be credited with the market value of your Trade-In Device at the value determined on www.three.co.uk/trade-in. </p>
<p>8.  The Cards are not for resale and cannot be exchanged for cash or credit. No responsibility will be accepted if your Card is lost, stolen or damaged. </p>
<p><span class="bold">Your device</span></p>
<p>9.  Your Trade-In Device must be fully functional, include the battery and be in a good condition in order to be eligible for this Promotion. A Trade-In Device will not be eligible for this Promotion if it is materially damaged. For the purposes of this Promotion “materially damaged” shall be determined exclusively by the in-store employee of Three and may include (but is not limited to) the following defects: </p>
<p>a)  An inability to power on or off; </p>
<p>b)  External or internal liquid damage; </p>
<p>c)  Aesthetic damage such as a screen crack, large scratch or visible LCD screen burn; </p>
<p>d)  A screen which does not work or is not in-tact; </p>
<p>e)  An inability to carry out the functionality reasonably expected of such Trade-In Device; or </p>
<p>f)  Any other damage which materially affects the appearance or functionality of Trade-In Device. </p>
     
<p>Any Trade-In Device must be original and meet the manufacturer’s original specifications. An in-store employee of Three may at any time reject a Trade-In Device. </p>
<p>10.  You must own all rights, title and interests in any device that you trade-in. We may ask for proof of ownership. </p>
<p>11.  Ownership of the device will pass to Three when your device is accepted for trade-in in a Three Retail Store. Your device will be purchased for onward recycling by Redeem UK Limited, a company incorporated and registered in Scotland with company number 194216 whose registered office is at Unit 9B, Pyramids Business Park, Easter Inch, Bathgate, West Lothian EH48 2EH (“<span class="bold">Redeem</span>”). </p>
<p>12.  You are responsible for cancelling any air-time or other usage contract linked to any such device. Three and Redeem are not responsible for any costs, charges and/or penalties arising before, or after, receipt of your device, or arising from any other circumstances whatsoever (together “<span class="bold">Charges</span>”). </p>
<p>13.  Please remove SIM cards and SD cards before trading in your device. Any SIM cards or SD cards received by Three or Redeem will be destroyed upon receipt in an appropriate manner, and, consequently cannot be returned. Three and Redeem accept no liability in the event that any device which is received by Three containing a SIM card or SD card is lost in transit. </p>
<p>14.  Please ensure all personal data is removed from the device before trading in your phone. This includes but is not limited to all personal details, SMS, photos, videos, games, songs or other data. Three and Redeem will not accept responsibility for the security, protection, confidentiality or use of such data. By trading in your device to Three and Redeem, you agree to release Three and Redeem from all and any losses, claims or damages with respect to the data enclosed or stored therein or on any media used in conjunction with the device. </p>
<p>15.  Where applicable, we recommend you take note of your IMEI number in case there is a problem with your order. Your IMEI number can generally be found at the back of your phone under the battery or by typing in *#06#.</p>
<p>16.  If you have a PIN or Password on your device you should remove this before trading-in. Each device should match the make and model stated when registering your order in store. </p>
<p>17.  Should your order contain a device that Redeem is unable to process (e.g. because of activation lock not being removed) Redeem (or Three on behalf of Redeem) will, where possible, endeavour to notify you of a remedy that might allow Three (on behalf of Redeem) to successfully process your device. If after a period of 48 hours from any such notification Three has received no reply from you, Three reserves the right to take such legal or other collection action it deems necessary to recover the amount paid to you for such device. Any stolen, blocked, counterfeit or fake devices will be held by Redeem and reported to the police and Redeem (or Three on behalf of Redeem) may take any further action they deem necessary in such event to recover the amount paid to you for such device. </p>
<p>18.  In the event that a Trade-In Device is not considered eligible for this Promotion due to its condition, the Trade-In Device shall be eligible for the normal in-store trade in program which is operated by Redeem and is subject to the terms &amp; conditions set out in https://www.threetradein.co.uk/terms.aspx. You will receive store credit in the amount of the market value of the device determined by the www.threetradein.co.uk website. This valuation is calculated by Redeem and Redeem will have the final decision on matters of valuation. </p>
<p>19.  The criteria used to value phones is based on numerous factors including changes in market value, functionality, grading and condition. Redeem may change the way in which it values devices from time to time and prices offered by Redeem are subject to change at any time without notice. Such changes are outside of Three’s control and Three accepts no liability for such changes. No two phones are ever the same and grading varies from model to model, depending on the damage and condition. Reductions to the value of the phone may vary depending on whether your phone can be reused, resold or recycled. </p>

<p><span class="bold">General</span></p>
<p>20.  Under no circumstances will Three (or its parent, subsidiaries and affiliated companies) be liable (unless such liability cannot be lawfully excluded) for any losses, damages, costs or expenses arising from or in any way connected with any errors, defects, interruptions, malfunctions or delays in this Promotion (or any aspects of them), and Three excludes liability, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for any loss or damage caused arising out of or connected to this Promotion. </p>
<p>21.  If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held by any competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the validity of the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions and the remainder of the provision in question will not be affected. </p>
<p>22.  These Terms and Conditions and any contract entered into between Three and you will be governed by English law. </p>

<div><span>8.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>There will be one winner for each prize. In the event that one or more individuals successfully Refer the same number of Friends, your place will be determined by time with the first to reach that number within the Promotion Period, ranked higher. For example, if at the end of the Promotion Period, there are three people who have each successfully referred 15 Friends, whoever first reached the 15 referrals, would be placed first; whoever reached 15 referrals second, will be placed second, and so on.</div>

<div><strong>Ways to join Three</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Price Plans &amp; ways to pay</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We aim to be highly competitive when it comes to our rates. Our prices vary depending on the plan you choose. The most up-to-date prices on our products and services are always available on our website and through Three stores and authorised retailers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Pay Monthly price plans (packages including a device and SIM Only) usually has minimum contract term, for example 24 months. If you are on a Pay Monthly plan you will have committed to remain connected to Three until the term has been completed. At Three we have the right to stop your service if you fail to pay money owed or breach our Terms and Conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some SIM Only Pay Monthly plans have a minimum term of one month and then continue to “roll” until you terminate these SIM only contracts at any time by giving us one month’s notice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you're on a Pay Monthly contract, we bill you for the services you use on a monthly basis. Every month we send you either an electronic bill or a paper bill in the post. Your bill can be either a fully itemised bill or a summary statement. If you have opted for a paper bill and you want a fully itemised bill, you will pay a charge for the itemised bill (or you can choose a free of charge summary statement) If you have opted for an electronic bill, you can choose to receive a fully itemised bill or a summary bill free of charge. Our bills will show your usage, charges and the date that a payment is due.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As far as payment is concerned, new customers can only join pay monthly plans on direct debit and our plans’ prices include a discount for paying by this efficient means. Direct debit is brilliant for you as payment will be taken automatically and your account will not be suspended if you forget to pay. It is also the most efficient method for us. You should maintain your direct debit whilst you stay as a pay monthly customer. You can change your bank details at any time, just let us know.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We cannot prevent you from cancelling your direct debit, and if you do, you are still required to pay your bills by the due date. We will retain your discount if you give us any of the following given means of payment provided that you simply allow us to store your selected payment method so that we can charge you on your billing date each month. Don’t worry, you can swap these details at any time and on multiple occasions. If you do not permit us to store payment details you will lose the recurring payment discount. You can choose any of the following given means of payment. Simply allow us to store details and you will remain eligible for the £5 monthly recurring discount.</div>
<p><img src="http://www.three.co.uk/static/images/Discover/chat/payment-methods.jpeg" alt="Payment methods"></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you're on a Pay Monthly price plan, you can check which calls, texts and services are included in your plan. Pay as You Go means just that - there’s no minimum term contract and no monthly bills; just buy a Pay as You Go phone from us and start using it straight away. When you run out of credit you just buy a Top-up voucher.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Pay As You Go Top-up vouchers can be purchased from a range of outlets across the UK including places you can purchase Three phones. If you register a credit or debit card, you can also top up using My3 online, My3 on your handset, and by calling 444 free from your Three phone. Further details on how it all works are available at three.co.uk. You can check Three's network coverage by going to <a title="Check your coverage and network" href="http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Network/Coverage">Network Coverage</a> at three.co.uk or by contacting customer services.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Number Portability:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you're a new customer to Three, you might want to move your existing mobile phone number to us. You can do this in three easy steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Contact the customer service group of your old service provider and ask for a PAC (Port Authorisation Code). Your old service provider must give you the PAC, or a reason why it cannot be issued, within 2 hours of your request. Usually your old service provider will be able to provide your PAC over the phone or by SMS, and may also follow this up in writing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Once you have your PAC, you need to give it to us before we can move your number. You can give us your PAC over the phone by calling 333 from your Three phone, using the online form at our Welcome to Three page, or by calling 0333 300 3333 (Your standard call charges will apply). Your PAC is valid for a period of 30 calendar days and your request must be submitted to Three within that time. If you don't give us your PAC within that time, you'll need to ask your old service provider for a new one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. If you ask for your number to be moved before 5pm Monday-Friday (excluding bank holidays), it should be moved during the next working day. If you ask to move your number outside of these times, we'll process your request as soon as we can on the next working day, and let you know when your number will be moved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Remember that if you transfer your number whilst you're still in the minimum term of your contract with your old provider, you may be liable for payments under that contract. However, you are entitled to request and receive your PAC at any time regardless of any payments that may be due to your provider under your contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are a Three customer and you want to move your number to another service provider, you should call us and ask for a PAC. Your PAC will be valid for 30 calendar days. You'll need to give your PAC to your new service provider to move your number to that network. If you don't use your PAC within those 30 days, you'll continue to receive and be charged for services from Three.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Keeping you up to date</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We use customer bills, leaflets, emails, letters, text, picture and video messages to keep you up to date with our news, services, products and exclusive deals. The latest Information is also available online at our website.</div>

<div><strong>Warranty, repairs and insurance</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your mobile will be covered by a manufacturer's warranty covering defects in material or workmanship. If you experience a problem with your device, just get in touch with us and we will tell you what to do next.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your device needs to be repaired, you will need to get in contact with the manufacturer so that it can be sent for repair. The device is normally repaired and returned back to you within 5 days.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We also offer insurance to cover you if anything goes wrong with your handset or if it gets lost or stolen – you can find out more about this at <a title="Three Rescue" href="http://www.three.co.uk/threerescue">Three.co.uk/threerescue</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Returns &amp; Exchanges policy</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We always hope you’re happy with your new purchase, whether it’s a Device or Accessory, and/or a service agreement for our Network Services, but just in case you’re not, here’s what you can do.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Purchases from Three Stores</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We’re sorry, but if you bought a Device or Accessory from a Three Store and you change your mind, you’ll be unable to return or exchange it, except in accordance with your statutory rights.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Purchases from Three.co.uk and Telesales</strong></div>
<div>If you change your mind, you can return or exchange your purchase within 14 days of receiving your Device or SIM card (where no Device was purchased). If you use any services during the returns period, you could be charged for those services and any reduction in value of the Device - you can turn on and use your Device to inspect it and to make sure you’ve received what you thought you were buying, but if any damage is caused, or it is used beyond what’s reasonable, we have the right to charge you for any loss in value to the goods as a result of your use or damage. You’re allowed to do what is reasonable to ensure you’ve received what you thought you were buying and that it works as expected. All Devices must be returned, together with all packaging, manuals, accessories, any free gifts and your proof of payment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You’ll also need to provide your receipt or delivery note as proof of purchase. If you are unsure what to do, please:&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. contact the retailer that sold it to you (if you didn’t purchase your device directly from Three); or&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. return to the Three Store that sold it to you (if you purchased your device from a Three store; or&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. call 0333 300 3333 (your standard call charges will apply) if you purchased your device from Three’s telephone sales team or three.co.uk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Other retailers that aren’t Three.</div>
<div>You’ll need to check with them to see what their returns and exchanges policy is. If you are given an exchange or refund, but have connected to Three and used any of our services then we may charge you for these. A full copy of our Returns &amp; Exchange policy can be found at three.co.uk/returns</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Our Network reliability</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The network may cease to function if there is a power cut or failure that affects the Three network. These failures may be caused by reasons outside our control. There can also be instances where service has to be stopped for a short period while essential maintenance is carried out. We try to keep these periods as infrequent and brief as possible and try to warn you if we think you will be affected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Emergency Services</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can make free calls to emergency services from your Three mobile. When you’re outside of coverage on our network, your phone will try to locate another mobile network so that you can make emergency calls. Emergency service calls cannot be made using the Skype service on your Three mobile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>The Key Small Print</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your Price Plan has a minimum term then you are committed to remain connected to Three until the expiry of that minimum term. If you sign up to a Pay Monthly Package which includes a Device, the Monthly Charge for this is the minimum price you agree to pay us for Three Services provided to you under your agreement, for the Minimum Term. Each May, your Monthly Charge will increase by an amount up to the January RPI rate (published each February), unless you're on a SIM plan. If the January RPI rate is negative, there will be no change to your Monthly Charge in the May.Three reserves the right to terminate service to a customer at any time if a customer fails to pay money owed to Three or breaches Three's Terms and Conditions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are on a minimum term contract, you are expected to pay any outstanding sums owed to the end of the minimum term of the contract.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Whether you're thinking about Pay As You Go or Pay Monthly, it's important you read and agree to stick to our Terms &amp; Conditions. You'll find these wherever Three devices are sold. A copy of our latest Terms and Conditions can also be viewed on our website at <a title="Three Terms and Conditions" href="http://www.three.co.uk/Terms">three.co.uk/Terms</a>.</div>

<div id="customer-complaints-code" class="" data-document-id="customer-complaints-code" data-ng-show="selected.document == &quot;customer-complaints-code&quot;"><div class=""><h2 class="">Customer Complaints Code</h2><div class=""><h2>Making a complaint.</h2>
<p> At Three we always want to make sure you have a great experience, and we hope that you’ll never have reason to complain about our services. However, if you think we haven’t done a good job, we’d like to hear from you. We’re also happy for someone else to raise a complaint on your behalf, as long as we have confirmation that they’re acting with your consent.</p>
<p> We've tried to make the complaints process as straightforward as possible and we aim to resolve all complaints within 14 days. There’s a few different ways to register your complaint with us, and you can find them all on our <a href="/support/complaints-code">How to Complain page.</a></p>
<p>We’ll do everything we can to sort out your complaint. However, if we haven’t been able to resolve it, you can ask the Ombudsman* to look at it for free.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach agreement within 8 weeks we will provide details of how to contact the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>*The Ombudsman is an independent organisation dedicated to sorting out disputes between customers and providers and Three will be bound by its decision if a case is opened.</p>
<p> <strong>The Ombudsman will only consider complaints:</strong><br>
•  Which are over 8 weeks old.<br>
•  Or if there is a deadlock situation.<br>
A deadlock arises when we believe we've done everything we can to sort out a complaint but can't reach an agreement with you.</p>
<p>You can request a deadlock letter from the advisor dealing with your complaint. However, if we are working on a solution, expect to resolve the complaint or recognise that your complaint fails outside the Ombudsman’s responsibilities we will not send a deadlock letter. Unfortunately on occasion we receive malicious complaints, which neither the Ombudsman nor Three will respond to.</p>

<p><strong>Online Purchases.</strong>
</p><p>If your complaint is about a purchase you made online and we’ve been unable to resolve your concerns through our complaints process, you can submit your complaint through the European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform, instead of contacting the Ombudsman directly. You can find the platform and more information on how it works here: <a title="European Comission" target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.</p>
<p>The platform simply facilitates the investigation and resolution of your complaint through the Ombudsman so, if you’re unhappy, you may find it easier to contact the Ombudsman directly. Remember, you can only use the platform if your complaint comes from an online transaction. If you made your purchase over the phone or in store, you need to contact the Ombudsman using the contact details above.</p>

<p>We may be required to obtain your personal information to comply with our legal requirements, to enable us to fulfil the terms of our contract with you or in preparation of us entering into a contract with you.&nbsp; If you do not provide the relevant personal information to us, we may not be able to provide services to you.<br>
<br>
<strong><br>
Personal information received from other sources<br>
</strong><br>
We may receive personal information about you from:<br>
<br>
(a)&nbsp;credit reference agencies such as CallCredit, Experian and Equifax including credit information about you (including information from the Electoral Register), and those with whom you are linked financially, to help us verify your identity and decide whether to accept your application or future applications. Such agencies will record details of our search and your application whether your application is successful or not. We and other organisations may use any of this information to make other credit decisions about you and other members of your household, and for identification purposes, debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
(b)&nbsp;fraud prevention agencies such as CIFAS. We and other companies may use this information if decisions are made about you on credit or credit-related services; and<br>
<br>
(c)&nbsp;commercial partners who supply goods and services to us.</p>
<p><strong><br>
Credit reference checks</strong><br>
<br>
In order to process your application, we will perform credit and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (“CRAs”).</p>
<p>To do this, we will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will give us information about you. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs will supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information and fraud prevention information.</p>
<p>We will use this information to:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 40px">•&nbsp;Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 40px">•&nbsp;Verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 40px">•&nbsp;Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 40px">•&nbsp;Manage your account(s);</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 40px">•&nbsp;Trace and recover debts; and</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-left: 40px">•&nbsp;Ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</div>
<br>
We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
<p>If you are making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together, so you should make sure you discuss this with them, and share with them this information, before lodging the application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.<br>
<br>
<strong>The identities of the CRAs, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail in the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (“CRAIN”). CRAIN is also accessible from each of the three CRAs – clicking on any of these three links will also take you to the same CRAIN document: Callcredit </strong><a href="http://www.callcredit.co.uk/crain"><strong>www.callcredit.co.uk/crain</strong></a><strong>; Equifax </strong><a href="http://www.equifax.co.uk/crain"><strong>www.equifax.co.uk/crain</strong></a><strong>; Experian </strong><a href="http://www.experian.co.uk/crain"><strong>www.experian.co.uk/crain</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong><br>
Automated decision making<br>
</strong><br>
As we’ve mentioned above, when you apply for a Pay Monthly plan, we will obtain information from a credit reference agency, which will be used in an automated decision process to determine whether we can enter into a contract with you. If you wish for the decision to be reassessed by a person, you may do so by calling our customer services team on 0333 338 1001 or by writing to: Three Customer Services, Hutchison 3G UK Ltd, PO Box 333 Glasgow G2 9AG. You can also object to a decision being taken solely by automated processing (see heading Your Rights below).<br>
<br>
<strong><br>
Retention of data<br>
<br>
</strong>We will keep your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, to provide you with services and to conduct our legitimate business interests or where otherwise required by law. If you use Three Services, we may hold your Communications Data for 12 months for legitimate business purposes (or longer in connection with any legal proceedings or disputes).<br>
<br>
<strong>Disclosure<br>
<br>
</strong>Your personal information may also be processed by:&nbsp;</p>

We can’t change how many adverts you see online, but we can  work with advertisers to try and make the advertising you see as useful and  relevant as possible. Advertisers define who they want to reach based on  factors such as interests, age range, location and more, and we help show  their ads to you if you match their criteria.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the Three app?</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Three app provides a variety of services to you as a Three customer, including:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Access to your authenticated My3 account data, which is downloaded from mobile.three.co.uk and displayed in the Three app (including the ability to review your allowances, current usage, extra charges incurred since your last bill, and your next bill date) provided that you are using your Three SIM and have access to an active cellular data connection to Three’s network.</li>

<p><strong><br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Collection and use of your personal information</strong></p>
<p><br>
Where you have provided consent we will collect and use the following information from your use of the Three app:</p>
<p><strong><br>
4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Information you give us</strong></p>
<p><br>
The Three app displays your My3 account data, which is collected through your use of Three’s service and is downloaded within the Three app from mobile.three.co.uk. As such, the Three app does not itself provide users with a means of giving us information, with the exception of your use of the following in-app forms/functions:</p>
<p><br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Move your number</strong>: This in-app form submits to Three a request to move your existing number to Three.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Change payment date</strong>: This in-app form submits to Three a request to change your payment date after your first bill.</p>
<p><br>
The information you give us through your use of the above forms/functions within the Three app includes your name, date of birth, post code. We will use this information solely for the purpose of assessing and responding to your request to move your number or change your payment date.</p>
<p><br>
For other functions made available by the Three app (including paying bills and topping-up) we will link you to mobile.three.co.uk where you may provide us with information including your name, address, email address, mobile number, date of birth, financial and credit/debit card information. Where you are sent via a link from the Three app to mobile.three.co.uk, the terms and conditions set out in the section “Other terms and conditions” above shall apply.</p>
<p><strong><br>
4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Information we collect about you</strong></p>
<p><br>
<strong>Authentication information</strong></p>
<p><br>
When you use the Three app, we will automatically carry out authentication checks to make sure that you are a Three customer with an active cellular data connection to Three’s network. During authentication, we will identify your mobile number, account number, account type in order to set up the Three app and download your My3 account data from mobile.three.co.uk, which will be displayed within the Three app.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>My3 account, technical, and device information</strong></p>
<p><br>
In addition, each time you use the Three app we will automatically collect the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your My3 account data from mobile.three.co.uk, including your mobile number, account number, account type, plan, allowances, current usage, billing and other account information. We will use this to display your My3 account data within the Three app.</li>
    <li>Technical information, including your IP address, device (name, type, model), operating system, network, and the data and time. We will use this technical information to analyse trends, administer and improve the Three app and the services we offer, track user movement through the Three app and gather statistical information about visits to, and active use of, the Three app.</li>
    <li>Information from your device, where you have granted the relevant operating system permissions. These include:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
If you are an Android device user, you may have specifically enabled the following permissions:</p>
<p><br>
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;READ_PHONE_STATE: We will use this to determine information about the cellular connection status of your device. This will enable Three to download your My3 account data and display it within the Three app.<br>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;READ_CONTACTS: We may use this information to provide you with enhanced billing information i.e. match phone numbers listed on your bills to the names of contacts stored on your device.<br>
<br>
If you are an iOS device user, you may have specifically enabled push notifications. We may use these to send relevant communications about Three services.<br>
<br>
<strong>Location data</strong><br>
<br>
Where you have enabled Location Services for the Three app via the permissions on your Android or iOS device, we may use and process your location data when you use the Store Locator function within the Three app, which identifies the Three store nearest to you. You can manage your location preferences at any time via your Android or iOS device.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keeping your device and Three app secure</strong></p>
<p><br>
You are responsible for the security of your device and must make sure that you keep it secure. To prevent unauthorised access to your device and Three app, you must keep any passwords and PIN numbers relating to your device and Three account safe and secure. You must not share them with anyone else. If you find or suspect that anyone else knows your passwords or PIN numbers, or has access to your Three app without your permission, you must contact us immediately. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How we may share your data</strong><br>
We may share data with carefully selected technical service suppliers who help us to bring this service to you but we never relinquish responsibility for your information, which will be used in compliance with applicable data protection law. <br>
The Three app uses the following third party software:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Adobe Analytics:</strong> We use this mobile app analytics software to track usage throughout the Three app. This helps us to analyse trends and improve the Three app.</li>
    <li><strong>Swrve:</strong> We use this mobile marketing software to provide in-app campaigns, A/B testing and to send push notifications provided that push notification permissions have been granted within your Android or iOS settings. This helps us to test new features with different segments, and provide campaigns, notifications or announcements about Three’s products and services.</li>
    <li><strong>ForeSee:</strong> We use this customer experience software to provide customer satisfaction surveys to you. This helps us to gather and analyse customer feedback about, and improve, the Three app. </li>
</ol>
<p><br>
<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Caching</strong><br>
This is the storing of certain app data on your device. Specifically, we cache app settings and My3 account data to ensure the Three app can be used while offline, to improve performance and reduce battery and network drain.</p>
<p><strong><br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
If we change this Privacy Policy we will post the amended policy at Three.co.uk/terms within the section entitled “Privacy &amp; Cookies”, which will be accessible from a link within the Three app so you will always aware of how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.</p>
<p><strong><br>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Access to data</strong><br>
You have a right to request a copy of any personal information that we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. We’ll charge you a £10.00 administrative fee to provide a copy of data held. You can download the form on Three.co.uk. If you can’t download the form, we can send you a copy - please call us on 333 (free) from a Three phone or 0330 300 3333 (if dialled from a mobile, this will come out of any inclusive allowance, or be charged at your out of allowance rates; other networks may vary).

<span class="bold"><h1 style="font-size:14px;">Recycling – waste electrical equipment &amp; batteries</h1></span>

<br>
<span class="bold"><h2 style="font-size:16px;">Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)</h2></span>

<p>If you’re buying a new electrical item, we will recycle your old one for free.</p> 

<br>

<span class="bold"><p>Why recycle? </p></span>

<p>Unwanted electrical equipment is the UKs fastest growing type of waste.</p> 

<p>Many electrical items can be repaired or recycled, saving natural resources and the environment.</p> If you do not recycle, electrical equipment will end up in landfill where hazardous substances will leak out and cause soil and water contamination – harming wildlife and also human health.<p></p> 

<span class="bold"><p>How we can help</p></span>

<p>We are pleased to offer our customers the chance to recycle their old electrical and electronic items when purchasing a new item from us.</p> 

<p>Please speak to a member of Three’s staff for details on how to dispose of your waste electrical or electronic item in store.</p> If you have purchased a new electrical item from our online store, <a href="/Support/Store_locator">click here</a> to find out where your nearest store is.<p></p> 

<p>To remind you that old electrical equipment can be recycled, it is now marked with a crossed‐out wheeled bin symbol.</p> Please do not throw any electrical equipment (including those marked with the crossed out wheeled bin symbol) in your bin.<p></p>

<img style="float:right;padding:10px;width: 100px;" src="http://store.three.co.uk/static/images/weeecomplianceicon.png" alt="WEEE bin icon">

<span class="bold"><p>What is WEEE? </p></span>

<p>The Waste Electrical or Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires countries to maximise separate collection and environmentally friendly processing of these items.</p> In the UK, distributors (including retailers) must provide a system which allows all customers buying new electrical equipment the opportunity to recycle their old items free of charge.<p></p>

<p>Those establishing their own take‐back scheme must as a minimum offer all customers buying new electrical equipment free take back of their old electricals on a like‐for‐like basis.</p>

<span class="bold"><h2 style="font-size:16px;">Waste batteries</h2></span>

<span class="bold"><p>Why recycle?</p> </span>

<p>Batteries must not be thrown away in household waste.</p> Recycling items helps to save our natural finite resources and also reduces the environmental and health risks associated with sending batteries landfill.<p></p>
By recycling batteries, you can play your part in minimising the negative effects to the environment and human health caused by the hazardous substances found in batteries.<p></p>


<span class="bold"><p>How we can help</p></span>

<p>We are obliged under the Waste Batteries Directive to offer our customers free take-back of their waste batteries.</p> This includes rechargeable batteries inside mobile phones.<p></p> 

<p>Please speak to a member of Three’s staff for details on how to dispose of your waste batteries in store.</p> <a href="/Support/Store_locator">Click here</a> to find out where your nearest store is.<p></p> 

<p>Alternatively, many large high street stores now provide a facility to return your old batteries for recycling.</p> Your local council waste site will also have facilities to recycle batteries.<p></p> 
Visit <a href="http://www.recyclenow.co.uk">http://www.recyclenow.co.uk</a> where you will find information regarding recycling and also the location of your local recycling centre.<p></p>

<span class="bold"><p>Important information when recycling batteries</p></span>

<p>Please do not attempt to remove fixed batteries from mobile phones or other equipment as they could explode or leak chemicals.</p>
Also, please do not post batteries back to us as there is the possibility of damage and leakage which could affect the environment.<p></p>

<div id="modernslaverystatement" class="" data-document-id="modernslaverystatement" data-ng-show="selected.document == &quot;modernslaverystatement&quot;"><div class=""><h2 class="">Our Modern Slavery Act Statement for Financial Year Ended 31 December 2017</h2><div class=""><h3><br>
Introduction.</h3>
<p>This is Hutchison 3G UK Limited’s (“Three’s”) slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 December 2017, made in relation to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re fully committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking from happening within our business and supply chain.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our group structure and business.</h3>
<p>Three provides mobile telecoms and data services to consumers, businesses and the wholesale market in the UK. We have around 10 million customers. We employ over 4,600 people across our offices in Maidenhead, Glasgow and Reading and 347 retail stores.</p>
<p>We’re a member of CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s group, which also has investments in mobile operations in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Macau, Sri Lanka, Sweden and Vietnam.</p>
<p>We own a 50% share in Mobile Broadband Networks Limited - a joint venture company with EE. There’s a separate Modern Slavery Act Statement online for that company <a href="https://www.mbnl.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MBNL-Modern-Slavery-Statement-2017-Financial-Year.pdf" class="maggie underline">"https://www.mbnl.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MBNL-Modern-Slavery-Statement-2017-Financial-Year.pdf"</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our supply chains.</h3>
<p>Most of our procurement activity is carried out by our UK-based procurement team. We work with a range of suppliers providing goods and services from a variety of sectors including network and telecoms services, IT and hardware, handsets and devices, marketing and other professional service providers.</p>
<p>We recognise that the highest risk areas of our supply chain are our offshore outsource service providers and handset and device manufacturers.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Our policies.</h3>
<p>We’re fully committed to making sure that modern slavery and human trafficking doesn’t happen in our supply chains or any part of our business. To achieve this, through our modern slavery working group, in 2017 we:</p>
<ul>
 <li> continued to use the Three Supply Partner Code of Conduct (<a href="http://www.three.co.uk/terms-conditions/code-of-conduct" class="maggie underline">http://www.three.co.uk/terms-conditions/code-of-conduct</a>) which we ask suppliers to commit to when entering new contracts with Three and have embedded into our standard contract terms; and
</li>
<li> continued to use an “Anti-Slavery Policy” for our employees, contractors or any other third party engaged by Three, to promote awareness of Modern Slavery and provide information on reporting requirements and Three’s monitoring activities. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Due diligence and compliance.</h3>
<p>To monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking happening in our business, in 2017 we:</p>
<ul>
    <li>carried out a risk assessment of our supply chain and sent a survey to our suppliers who work in higher risk areas. This survey was designed to assess their methods of preventing slavery and human trafficking;</li>
    <li> reviewed modern slavery statements published by those of our suppliers who we deem to be operating in higher risk areas;</li>
<li> ensured that our terms required our suppliers to comply with the Three Supply Partner Code of Conduct and to implement policies and procedures to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015;] and</li>
<li> reviewed modern slavery statements published by those of our suppliers who we deem to be operating in higher risk areas;</li>
<li> introduced a policy of sending our modern slavery survey to suppliers operating in higher risk areas, as part of our supplier due diligence process;</li>
<br>
    &nbsp;
</ul>
<h3>Training.</h3>
<p>We also educate staff where relevant to recognise the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains. In 2017, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>delivered ongoing guidance and training on how to identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain to our procurement teams and other key employees; and
</li>
    <li>made a whistleblowing hotline available for our employees to use if they have concerns about slavery and human trafficking.</li>
</ul>
