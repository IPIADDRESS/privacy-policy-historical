          confirms that THQ is a valid licensee and participating member in the 
          Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy

          by sending an e-mail to privacypolicy@thq.com, a facsimile to (818) 
          871-7400, or by writing to: Privacy Policy Administrator, c/o THQ Inc., 
          27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301. You can also 
          contact ESRB Privacy Online directly at (212) 759-0700 or by regular

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>WHAT AND HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED </b></p>
        <p>THQ may request and collect information from our online visitors on 
          a voluntary basis and only during: (1) product registration; (2) contest 
          registration; (3) demo or patch download; (4) registration for game-specific 
          event participation; (5) online purchasing; (6) web site registration; 
          and, (7) Customer Service and Technical support sessions. The requested 
          information may include personal identifying information such as <b>your 
          name, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, home address, and age</b>. 
          Visitors purchasing goods or services through our Online Store will 
          need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition 
          to the credit card holder's name, mailing address, phone number and 
          e-mail address. In addition, THQ may collect demographic information 
          such as platform preference, and magazine or retailer preference.</p>
        <p>THQ collects personal information via conventional Internet forms. 
          For example, a new user to our web site may be asked to register by 
          providing his or her name, phone number, fax number, and home address. 
          This information will then be associated with your e-mail account, so 
          that you may identify yourself during future visits to our web site. 
          THQ also stores and maintains personal information that you submit to 
          us in an e-mail or that you post on our bulletin board. </p>
        <p>From time to time, however, THQ may employ third-party vendors, such 
          as NetSales, to collect personal information on THQ's behalf. These 
          third parties operate or sponsor some of the services we provide you 
          including online product fulfillment, free e-mail, promotions, and contests 
          and sweepstakes. When requesting these services, you may be asked to 
          supply your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, valid 
          credit card number and expiration date. Although these third-party vendors, 
          not THQ, collects the personal information you provide when requesting 
          such services, THQ still requires that all third parties adhere to THQ's 
          stated privacy policies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>INFORMATION USAGE AND DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
        <p>The information you provide us is collected by THQ and may be shared 
          with third-party vendors for the following reasons: (1) to inform you 
          of new products, features and enhancements, promotional offers, and, 
          contests and events of interest; (2) to fulfill prizes; (3) to provide 
          you feedback on technical support or customer service inquiries; (4) 
          to monitor and improve the use and satisfaction of our site; and, (5) 
          for our internal marketing and demographic research, so we can improve 
          our web site and products to better meet our visitors' requirements. 
          Whatever our business objectives may be, we only collect and share information 
          to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill those objectives. 
          In addition, third-party vendors have agreed to maintain the confidentiality 
          and security of the information we share with them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>REFUSAL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION </b></p>
        <p>THQ does not require registration or submission of personal information 
          to obtain basic access to our web site; however, you may not be able 
          to access all areas and functions of our web site, including the online 
          sales area and the Customer Service and Technical Support area. You 
          may contact our Customer Service center by phone or by mail if you have 
          concerns about online submission of personal identifying information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>OPT-OUT</b></p>
        <p>If you do not want THQ to send you e-mail or postal mail about our 
          products and services, you can opt out at the time of registration or 
          information collection, or at any time in the future by contacting THQ 
          by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@thq.com">privacypolicy@thq.com</a> 
          or by mailing or faxing a request to THQ Inc., Privacy Policy Administrator, 
          27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301; (fax) 818-871-7400.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES</b></p>
        <p>We use "cookies" on our web site. Cookies are very small 
          data files left on your computer by our Site. These files can then be 
          accessed by our Site in the future, so that you may resume a shopping 
          session, etc. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. 
          You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies 
          are being sent, although this may affect your ability to shop online, 
          both at THQ and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>THQ also keeps track of Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses 
          in order to support our Message Board software. An IP address is a number 
          that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every 
          time you log on to the Internet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>You should be aware that when you are on THQ's web site, you could 
          be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links 
          to other sites from THQ's web site that may take you outside our service. 
          We cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these websites meet 
          our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program. 
          As always, we recommend reading the privacy policy of any new site you 
          go to online.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
        <p>If for any reason you wish to access, review, correct or delete the 
          personal information collected about you, you may do so online at <a href="http://www.thq.com/registration">http://www.thq.com/registration</a>. You 
          must be able to provide your account name (e-mail address) and password. 
          If you have forgotten your password, you may select the option to have 
          it emailed to you. Once identified, we will be happy to review, update 
          or remove your information as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>SAFEGUARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
        <p>THQ maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity 
          and privacy of your personal information. For example, when you place 
          an order, access your account information, or send us personal information 
          at our request, the information collected moves into a secure server. 
          THQ uses "Secure Socket Layers" ("SSL"), an advanced 
          encryption technology that protects your credit card number and other 
          personal information, including your name and address, so that no one 
          can read it in transit. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD</b></p>
        <p><u>Collection of Information</u></p>
        <p>Children under 13 may not participate in online activities that require 
          registration without the prior written consent of a parent or legal 
          guardian ("parent"). A copy of our permission form can be 
          found at <a href="http://www.thq.com/Policies/ParentPermission.pdf">http://www.thq.com/Policies/ParentPermission.pdf</a>. 
          This form must be signed by the child's parent or legal guardian and 
          returned to THQ by fax at (818) 871-7400 or by mailing to THQ Inc., 
          Privacy Policy Administrator, 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas 
          Hills, CA 91301. Until we receive verifiable permission from a parent, 
          a child under 13 may not submit or post his or her personal information 
          on our site. </p>
        <p>In addition, we urge parents to instruct their children to never give 
          out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, 
          when using the Internet. Once we have obtained parental consent, we 
          only ask the child for information that is reasonably necessary for 
          the child to participate in our online activities. Parents also have 
          the ability to consent to the collection of their children's information 
          without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties. 
        </p>
        <p>If a child submits personal information to our customer support, THQ 
          collects that information solely for the purpose of responding to the 
          child's one-time request. Once THQ has responded to the child's request, 
          the information is deleted.</p>
        <p><u>Parental Access</u></p>
        <p>If you believe that any of your child's personal information is inaccurate, 
          or if you wish to verify the information we have in our records, please 
          contact the THQ Privacy Policy Administrator by sending an e-mail to 
          <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@thq.com">privacypolicy@thq.com</a>, a 
          facsimile to (818) 871-7400, or by writing to: Privacy Policy Administrator, 
          c/o THQ Inc., 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301. 
          We will check and update information as appropriate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <b>QUESTIONS OR COMPLAINTS</b>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, complaints, or comments about THQ or this 
          privacy policy, please contact THQ's Privacy Policy Administrator by 
          sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@thq.com">privacypolicy@thq.com</a>, a facsimile to
