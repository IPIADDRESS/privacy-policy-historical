"we") respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and are
committed to protecting the personal information collected about you. To further
this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy
Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you

meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of
this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other
enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB
Privacy Online.</p>
<p>Because the website you are currently visiting displays the ESRB Privacy

<p>What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</p>
</b>
<p>The website you are currently visiting is operated by THQ located at 27001
Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas, CA 91301. This Privacy Policy currently
applies to the website(s) operated by THQ<b> </b>(collectively referred to as
"THQ Websites" or "our Websites"). Please <u><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://www.thq.com/policies/sites.asp">click
here</a></font></u> to see a complete list of the applicable websites. In the
future, if we wish to include additional websites under this Privacy Policy, we
will take reasonable steps to include them in the list and ensure that they
provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted
and collected online through the THQ<b> </b>Websites (as listed above), and does
<u>not</u> apply to information that may be collected by THQ offline.<b> </b>In
addition, this Privacy Policy does <u>not</u> extend to websites maintained by
our international affiliates (e.g., THQ Australia, THQ UK, THQ France, etc.) or
other companies or organizations to which we link. Because we cannot guarantee
that the privacy policies of such sites meet the requirements of the ESRB
Privacy Online Program, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the
website to which you link before you submit any personal information to that
site.</p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Please note that by using our Websites, you signify your assent to THQ's
Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not
use our Websites. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these
changes. Your continued use of our Websites will signify your acceptance of
these changes.</i><font face="Times New Roman"></font></p><font face="Times New Roman">

<p>What types of information does THQ collect?<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
</font></b>
<p>In order to give you the best experience on our Websites, THQ may collect
information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically,
we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection
with any one of the following features or services.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Website and game-specific registration</li>
  <li>Newsletter subscription</li>
  <li>General support</li>
  <li>Product support</li>
  <li>Online store</li>
  <li>Contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions</li>
  <li>Polls, surveys, or questionnaires</li>
  <li>Message boards</li>	
  <li>Other features such as e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend</li>
</ul>
<p>The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities
will vary depending on the activity. The requested personal information may
include: your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address and (for
those purchasing products online) credit card information including billing and
shipping addresses. For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and
password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date
of birth, gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the
games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also
known as "demographic information"). If demographic information is
collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may
combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining
data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the services we provide
you according to your interests and preferences. For more on how we use your
information, please read the section on use below.</p>
<p>No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use
that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably
necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business
objectives.</p>
<b>
<p>How does THQ use the information it collects?</p>
</b>
<p>Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for
that purpose only. For example, if you request product support, the email
address that you provide will only be used for purposes of diagnosing your
specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution. Information
collected from those who register on our Websites is used to provide registrants
the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletter
or access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions). And, of
course, any credit card information is solely used to fulfill and process
purchase orders. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to
have your information used for an activity or service different from the
activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered
into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose
to receive these additional services, THQ will use your information to provide
them to you.</p>
<p>We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that
tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, new areas or features on our
Websites, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other
related changes.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal and demographic information for our internal
marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online
products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.</p>
<p>Please be advised that in some areas of our Websites, you may be able to
submit information about yourself in a business capacity. Although we can assure
you that any personal information gathered in this context will be used solely
for its intended purpose, such information is not subject to this Privacy
Policy. These areas typically include an employment section where you can submit
your resume online and/or an investors relations section where you can fill out
an online form to request financial information about our THQ.</p>
<b>
<p>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to THQ?</p>
</b>
<p>If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not
be able to participate in certain activities on our Websites and may limit the
services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email
address, you may not be able to receive general support or product support. To
simply browse our Websites, however, you do not need to give us any personal
information.</p>
<b>
<p>Does THQ use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to
collect information?</p>
</b><u>
<p>Cookies</p>
</u>
<p>We<b> </b>may use cookies to improve the use and functionality of our
Websites. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that
websites often store on a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system
provides an easy and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on
our Websites. For example, cookies will remember what you've placed in your
shopping cart, tell us that you have visited one of our Websites before, and may
contain other information that will make your next visit to our Websites more
enjoyable. We may combine information contained in cookies with your personal
information. You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you
when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your
ability to shop online, both at THQ and elsewhere.</p>
<u>
<p>Web Beacons</p>
</u>
<p>We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our Websites or include them in the
e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs")
are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on
a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use
web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor
counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization.
Information gathered through web beacons may be linked to your personal
information.</p>
<u>
<p>IP Addresses</p>
</u>
<p>THQ may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to troubleshoot
technical concerns and to maintain website safety and security. An IP address is
a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer
every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
<u>
<p>Log Files</p>
</u>
<p>THQ may collect information in the form of logs - files that record website
activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries
are generated anonymously, and help THQ determine (among other things) how many
and how often users have visited our Websites, which pages they've visited, and
other similar data (a.k.a., navigational data). We also use the log file entries
for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve
the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are
not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.</p>
<b>
<p>Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?</p>
</b>
<p>The information that you disclose on the THQ Websites is collected by THQ or
by a vendor on THQ's behalf; and, is used in accordance with the practices set
forth above. Vendors (or agents) are
entities that provide support for the internal operations of our Websites and
who only use the information we share with them (or that they collect on our
behalf) for purposes of internal fulfillment (e.g., online product fulfillment).
Vendors are required to handle such information in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may run contests, tournaments, or other events or
activities ("events") on our Websites. Information collected for these
events may include personal information such as your email address and may be
collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other
reputable third party (e.g., promotional partner, software licensee, or game
developer). While we have no control over the third party's use of such
information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the
confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share
with them (or that they collect through our Websites). If you do not want your
information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not
to participate in these events at the time the information is collected.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are
required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law
enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of
fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or
may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger,
acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, THQ's customer
information may be transferred to our successor or assign.</p>
<b>
<p>Can I choose how my personal information is used?</p>
</b>
<p>If you do not want to receive our newsletter, service related announcements,
or any other communications and/or services from THQ, please opt-out from these
communications or services at the time of registration or information
collection. If you have opted-in and, at a later time, wish to opt-out, please
visit the appropriate "Profile" section on our Websites or contact us
using the information provided below.</p>
<b>
<p>How can I access my personal information?</p>
</b>
<p>If you wish to review, update, or delete any personal information that we may
have collected about you, please visit the appropriate "Profile"
section on our Websites or contact us using the information provided below.</p>
<b>
<p>What is THQ's policy regarding children under 13?</p>
</b>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information such as name and email
address from children under 13 years old on our Websites. We take steps to
ensure that those who wish to register or submit personal information on our
Websites meet certain age requirements before they can do so. We recognize the
importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to
check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.</p>
<p>From time to time, certain portions of the THQ Websites may allow children
under 13 to disclose a limited amount of personal information without first
telling us their age or getting their parent’s permission. Such portions of
our Websites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not
require prior parental consent.</p>
<b>
<p>What safeguards does THQ use to protect my personal information?</p>
</b>
<p>THQ takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and
integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors.
Personal information collected by THQ is stored in secure operating environments
that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized
employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to
prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such
as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect
the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For
example, before we allow web users to access their personal information, we
verify their identity by requesting information such as their username and
password.</p>
<p>Although we cannot guarantee that third parties to whom we transfer personal
data will adhere to the security standards set forth above, we will take
reasonable measures to assure that they provide sufficient protection over such
data.</p>
<b>
<p>How do I ask a question or file a complaint? (Contact Information)</p>

Policy or our information collection practices, please contact our Privacy
