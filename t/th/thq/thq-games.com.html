	<p><b>Children and This Site</b></p>
<p>It is important to us that children can enjoy this Site in a responsible fashion.  We, therefore, encourage children to consult with their parents before providing personal information and require that applicants who are under 14 years of age get parental consent before using this Site.  As such we may refuse to allow registration on this Site by children under 14 years of age.  If a child below the age of 14 would like to access content only available through registration, their parent should register on this Site themselves and access the content for their child, thereby supervising their childs online activities whilst on this Site.  </p>

	<p>We further encourage parents to supervise their childrens online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment.  These tools can also help prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.</p>

	<p><b>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</b></p>

	<p>THQ takes your privacy seriously, and takes every reasonable precaution to safeguard the personal information you supply to us.  In order to give you the best experience on this Site, THQ may collect personal information from you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us.  Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, and it will usually take the form of either: (1) registration; (2) requests for technical support/customer service; and/or (3) personal information submitted in a business capacity (e.g. CVs).  The types of information that may be requested for each activity and the way information may be used are detailed below.  Any information you provide is safeguarded under the terms of the Act.<br>
In addition to the uses specified above, we may on occasion use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services that we provide.  We may also ask you for other information, including, but not limited to, your interests, in order to assist us in our initiatives outlined above and to improve our understanding of customer trends and patterns.  However, if we make such a request, we will clearly mark whether or not we need such information for providing products or services to you.</p>

	<p>Your data, together with that of other users of this Site, may be aggregated (e.g. by postcode or age) for the purpose of building statistical and analytical reports.  At no time will your data be individually identifiable in such reports.</p>

	<p>No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfil your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>

	<p><b>Registration</b></p>

	<p>In order to register for this Site and to subsequently participate in this Sites on-line activities and competitions, information will be required to be submitted to THQ.  The types of information that may be collected at these pages include, but are not limited to: your name, age, sex, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number.  We request these details in order to register you as a user of this Site, to provide services to you, to respond to any queries you may have and to understand customer trends and patterns.</p>

	<p><b>Technical Support/Customer Service</b></p>

	<p>THQ may collect and temporarily store personal information that you voluntarily submit to us via e-mail when contacting Customer Service.  For example, we provide on this Site a link through which an online visitor can send e-mail to customer service addressing any issue a user encounters with a THQ product.  Any personal information contained in such email is used by THQ for the sole purpose of responding to your question.  Although most e-mail messages are deleted immediately after they are responded to, in certain cases hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file for security purposes.  Any such copy or data will also be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for marketing purposes.</p>

	<p><b>What Happens If I Choose Not To Give My Personal Information?</b></p>

	<p>If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on this Site and may considerably limit the services we can provide you.  For example, if you refuse to provide your email address when registering, you will not be able to enter competitions and receive our newsletter.  To simply use this Site, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.<br>
However, we may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to third parties including advertisers, business partners and sponsors.  This is statistical data about our usersâ€™ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.  For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file as described below.</p>


	<p><b>Cookies, IP Addresses and Other Passive Information</b></p>

	<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

	<p>When you visit this Site we may send cookies to your computer primarily to enhance your on-line experience.  Cookies are small files or record-keeping devices that websites often store on a users computer in order to identify them as a unique customer and store personal preferences as well as technical information.  For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that you have visited our website before, and may contain information that will make your next visit to this Site more enjoyable.  In addition, cookies may include information about the type of browser software you use to access the Internet (e.g., Internet Explorer or Netscape 3.0), the type of operating system you use (e.g., Windows Vista, Mac, etc.), and/or the domain name of your Internet service provider.  However, THQ will not use cookies to store any personal information, such as your name, or retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.</p>

	<p>Although most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can set most browsers at any time to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, please note that some parts of this Site may not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p>

	<p><b>IP Addresses</b></p>

	<p>THQ keeps track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Your IP address is typically used to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>

	<p><b>Other Information</b></p>

	<p>Other information collected passively by THQ is in the form of logs  files that record website activity, including how many hits a particular web page is getting (sometimes referred to as click-through data).  For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks an image on this Site.  These entries are generated anonymously, and enable THQ to assess overall site activity, track interest in particular portions of this Site, troubleshoot technical concerns, and identify the type of browser you are using.  We may also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you.  Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user or with any personal information.</p>

	<p><b>Who Collects My Personal Information?</b></p>

	<p>The information that you disclose while visiting our website is collected by THQ (UK) Limited, and is used in the manner specified above.<br>
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of this Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  You must not share a password with anyone.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.  Athough we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to this Site; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access to that information.</p>

	<p><b>Information Sharing</b></p>

	<p>We may share information about visitors to this Site in aggregate with third parties including advertisers, business partners and sponsors, to understand customer trends and patterns and manage and improve our business relationships.  Please be assured that such information will be anonymous and will contain no personally identifiable information about you, or any other user of this Site.  We may also share your details with third parties (such as auditors or legal advisors) to obtain professional advice.</p>

	<p>Any agents and contractors of THQ who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing.</p>

	<p>We will not disclose your personal information to any outside organisation who wants to market goods or services to you without first obtaining your consent.  If you provide such consent but subsequently decide that you no longer wish us to make such disclosures to other organisations for this purpose, then you can simply e-mail us at <a href="mailto:ukwebmaster@thq.com" target="_blank">ukwebmaster@thq.com</a> and we will edit your information for you accordingly.</p>

	<p>We may disclose information we hold in response to legal proceedings, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We may also disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agencys request.  Consequently, although we will take all reasonable efforts to ensure that this Privacy Policy is complied with, we cannot guarantee that personal information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p><b>Links, Advertisers, Third Party Sponsors &amp; Ad-Servers</b></p>

	<p>Occasionally, the Site may contain links to other sites where information practices may be different to ours.  For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you off this Site.  This includes links from advertisers, channel sponsors and partners that may use our logos as part of a co-branding agreement.  Visitors should consult the other sites privacy notices as we are not responsible for and have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>

	<p>We sometimes may offer content (e.g., competitions or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties.  By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to participate in this activity.  We are not responsible for and have no control over these third parties use of this information.  However, we will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.</p>

	<p>We may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at this Site.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third party ad server may have collected from you.</p>

	<p><b>Security</b></p>

	<p>Although absolute security cannot be guaranteed on the Internet, please be assured that this Site has measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under THQâ€™s control.  We will continue to maintain and improve these measures over time in line with legal and technological developments.  Personal information collected by THQ is stored in secure operating environments that are designed so as not to be available to the public.  In many instances the personal information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction.  To transmit your information securely you must have a browser enabled with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  Browsers that have this software include Netscape Navigator 3.0 or higher, and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher.</p>

	<p><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b></p>

	<p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.  We will not use or disclose personal information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without informing you and providing you with an opportunity to opt-out of these unrelated uses.</p>

	<p><b>Access to Information</b></p>

	<p>You can contact us at any time by e-mail at <a href="mailto:ukwebmaster@thq.com" target="_blank">ukwebmaster@thq.com</a> and request to see the personal information we have collected through this Site which relates to you, and in some cases, your children, and to ask us to make any necessary changes to correct or update your information.  To protect your privacy and security we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access. <br>
Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act.  Any access request may be subject to a fee of Â£10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>

	<p><b>Opting Out</b></p>

	<p>You may at any time de-register from the Site and have your personal information removed from the THQ database by emailing <a href="mailto:ukwebmaster@thq.com" target="_blank">ukwebmaster@thq.com</a>, or by writing to Web Master, THQ (UK) Limited., at the address at the top of this Privacy Policy to request de-registration.
