<p>Amended &amp; Restated
<br>Last Updated: May 29, 2007

</p><p>Rental Connection Group ("RCG") takes your privacy seriously. Please read this to learn about our policy regarding visitor and member privacy. 
		
		</p><p><b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b>
		
		</p><p></p><blockquote>
		This Privacy Policy covers RCG's treatment of personally identifiable information that RCG collects when you are on the Web site located at ThatRentalSite.com, and when you use RCG's services. This policy also covers RCG's treatment of any personally identifiable information that RCG's business partners share with RCG. 
		<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that RCG does not own or control, or to people that RCG does not employ or manage.

		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b>
		</p><p></p><blockquote>

		RCG collects personally identifiable information when you register for a RCG account and when you use the service. RCG may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners. 
		<p>When you register with RCG, we ask for your email address, and zip code. You may also be requested to provide additional information to RCG after you have registered, providing information such as your name, your age, your education level, and your income range. Once you register with RCG and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
		</p><p>RCG also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, RCG cookie information and the page you requested. 
		</p><p>RCG uses your information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see on our pages, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and in some cases, to contact you.

		</p></blockquote>
		<p><a name="thirdparty"></a><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>
		</p><p></p><blockquote>

		RCG will not provide your personally identifiable information to other companies or people except in the following instances: 

		<p></p><ul>
		<li>We have your consent to share the information;<br></li>
		<li>We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;<br></li>
		<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of RCG to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);<br></li>
		<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or <br></li>
		<li>We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the RCG Terms of Service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.<br></li> 
		</ul>

		
		</blockquote>
		<b>Cookies</b>
		<p></p><blockquote>

		Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our site. RCG may set and access RCG cookies on your computer. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information.
		<p>RCG allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to RCG's cookies. 
		</p><p>RCG uses web beacons to access our cookies within our network of web sites and in connection with RCG products and services. 
		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and 
		Preferences</b>

		</p><p></p><blockquote>
	
		RCG gives you the ability to edit your RCG Account Information and preferences at any time. 
		<p>You may request deletion of your RCG account by sending an email to <a href="mailto:staff@ThatRentalSite.com">staff@ThatRentalSite.com</a>.

		</p></blockquote>
		<p><b>Security</b>
		</p><p></p><blockquote>

		Your RCG Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and security. 
		<p>In certain areas, RCG may use SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. 

		</p></blockquote>

		<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b>
		</p><p></p><blockquote>

		RCG may edit this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages. 

		</blockquote>

		<p><b>Business Transfers</b>

		</p><p></p><blockquote>
		If there is an acquisition of RCG's business (whether by merger, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of RCG, or otherwise), your information could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser. However, if the purchaser materially changes this Privacy Policy or the information handling practices as described in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified through a notice posted on this page of the site.
		</blockquote>
		
		<p><b>Privacy of Children</b>
	
		</p><p></p><blockquote>
		RCG is not directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our site in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and do not permit registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. This requirement is clearly posted during the registration process.
		
		</blockquote>

		
		<p><b>Questions or Suggestions</b>
		
		</p><p></p><blockquote>
		If you have questions or suggestions complete a feedback form or send 
		an email to <a href="mailto:staff@ThatRentalSite.com">staff@ThatRentalSite.com</a>.
