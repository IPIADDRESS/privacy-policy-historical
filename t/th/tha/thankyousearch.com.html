Any such controversy or claim must be arbitrated on an individual basis, and must not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration must be conducted in Los Angeles, California, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof.
