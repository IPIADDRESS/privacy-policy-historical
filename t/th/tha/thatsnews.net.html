cmmnts.com welcomes your participation in our discussion forums. These forums
offer you the chance to interact with leaders and experts in our community,
along with the journalists, editors and management of cmmnts.com, and with
other cmmnts.com users.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We ask that you post with respect for all players â€<span class="GramE">“ people</span> in the news, journalists, fellow forum
participants, etc. This is a community. So, when you post, we encourage you to
tell your fellow community members a little about who you are â€<span class="GramE">“ not</span> just a screen name or an E-mail address, but a
bit of a bio. It enriches the discussion to know <span class="SpellE">whoâ</span>€™s
<span class="SpellE">â€œbehind</span> the <span class="SpellE">post.â</span>€&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In order to keep these forums enjoyable and interesting for all of our users,
we ask that you follow these simple rules. By participating in the discussion
forums, you are consenting to these rules. Violators may be warned, suspended
from posting, or banned from the forums or chats, at the sole discretion of the

from posting, or banned from the forums or chats, at the sole discretion of the
cmmnts.com staff.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1. Exercise common sense and be considerate toward your fellow users. Diversity
of opinion and intelligent civil discourse is encouraged; by the same token,
insults and <span class="SpellE">â€œflamingâ</span>€
will not be tolerated. Disagreeing with an idea of another community member is
different from attacking that individual.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2. Do not post off-topic. Please keep your comments consistent with the subject
and purpose of the conversation thread. Deliberate disruption â€<span class="GramE">“ such</span> as consistent off-topic or frivolous commentary
â€“ will not be tolerated such posts will be deleted. <span class="GramE">cmmnts.com</span> and its moderators reserve the right to delete
posts and/or whole conversations we determine are of an irrelevant, abusive or
disruptive nature. This is your community. Let us or your fellow posters know
if you feel things are getting off-topic or inappropriate.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3. No all-caps (FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THIS) or all-bolds please. It is extremely
hard to read. Posts submitted in all-caps or all-bolds will be deleted
automatically.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4. Although we love the extra information and sources you bring to this <span class="SpellE">â€œmicroblogosphere,â</span>€
due to copyright and space issues, please do not quote entire news articles
from other sources; small excerpts and/or a link keeps things legal. Please
provide a link. Cutting and pasting of outside content is limited to three
sentences. Any more than three, the whole post will be deleted. Also, to keep
