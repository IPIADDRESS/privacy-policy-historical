<h2 id="thalmic-labs-inc-">Thalmic Labs Inc.</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. Thalmic Labs Inc. (“Thalmic”) has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit www.thalmic.com (the “Thalmic Site”), why we collect it and how it is used. This Privacy Policy is governed by our Terms of Use. By using the Thalmic Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. We may change this Privacy Policy by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on this Site which it is your responsibility to review.</p>
<h3 id="personally-identifiable-information">Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>“Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Thalmic may ask to collect Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use the Thalmic Site. Thalmic also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request. It is always your choice whether or not you provide us with your Personally Identifiable Information; however, a decision to withhold Personally Identifiable Information may restrict or prevent us from providing you with a particular product or service.</p>
<h3 id="limiting-use-disclosure-and-retention">Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</h3>
<p>Our collection of Personally Identifiable Information is limited to what is reasonable under the circumstances, and your information will be used for the purpose for which it was collected, or when it is required or permitted by law. We may inform you about products and services by mail, e-mail, text message, telephone, or other means. If you do not wish to receive direct marketing, contact us and tell us that you do not wish to be contacted in a particular manner.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-service-providers">Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to Personally Identifiable Information only to the extent needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. By providing your Personally Identifiable Information to Thalmic in order to obtain Thalmic products or services, you acknowledge and agree that disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information to such third parties may be necessary to provide you with such products and services, and you hereby consent to such disclosure.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-and-disclosing-information">Sharing and Disclosing Information</h3>
<p>Other than as expressly set forth herein, Thalmic does not rent, sell or share personal information it collects about you to or with third parties. Information collected from you is only used to complete and support your purchases from and use of the Thalmic Site and to comply with any requirements of law. However, Thalmic may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Thalmic or the Thalmic Site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Thalmic; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Thalmic, its web sites or the public. If Thalmic should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may sell the information you provide to us on the Thalmic Site to a third party (in the case of bankruptcy) or share your Personally Identifiable Information with any company with whom we merge – in such situations, Thalmic will require, to the best of its ability, the purchasing or merging party to comply with all confidentiality and privacy requirements as set forth herein respecting your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Thalmic may combine your information with other information into an aggregate form, so your information no longer personally identifies you. We may then disclose the aggregate information to third parties, so they can obtain an overall picture of Thalmic’s products, services, customer usage patterns and/or other statistical information</p>
<h3 id="security-of-information">Security of Information</h3>
<p>Thalmic will take reasonable precautions to maintain the confidentiality and security of your Personally Identifiable Information so that it is not disclosed to anyone outside our group of companies and our selected third party service providers/business partners without your consent, unless required by law or as otherwise set forth herein. Where possible, Thalmic Labs protects the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input.</p>
<h3 id="international-transfers">International Transfers</h3>
<p>Personal information collected on the Thalmic site may be stored and processed in Canada or any other country in which Thalmic or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Thalmic Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance-of-personal-information">Maintenance of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Thalmic has established the following practices regarding the maintenance of your personal information.</p>
<ul>
<li>If, for any reason, you wish to review your personal information that Thalmic has in its possession, you can contact our Privacy Officer, who will be pleased to provide you with all your personal information that Thalmic has on file.</li>

For example, if you move or change credit cards, you may be required to update your information in order to keep receiving the products and services provided by Thalmic. If you wish to make any changes or corrections to your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer who will implement the changes.

<li>You always have the choice of whether you wish to receive information – such as e-mail updates – from Thalmic. If you do choose to opt out of communications respecting products and services provided by Thalmic, you may not obtain all the benefits we could otherwise provide, such as updates or warnings. Thalmic will not have any liability to you for your loss of those benefits or any negative effects respecting your use of Thalmic’s products or services.</li>
<li>A situation may arise where you desire to have all of your personal information that is contained in Thalmic’s records deleted or destroyed. If this is what you wish, please contact our Privacy Officer, who will take care of removing your personal information from all of Thalmic’s active records. However, there may be situations where we are obligated to retain one archival copy of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal processes, and there may be instances where we are unable to remove your specific information from our records for technical reasons. We will inform you of all such situations, and will only use your retained personal information to the limited extent necessary to comply with such laws or respond to legal processes.</li>
</ul>

Thalmic may, at its sole discretion, provide an estimate of some or all of the Import Fees that will be levied on the items in your order for shipment (“Import Fee Estimate”) during the purchase process. By placing your order, you agree to allow us to collect the Import Fees Estimate for the applicable items in your order. With respect to each item to which an Import Fee Estimate applies, you authorize us to designate a carrier to act as your agent with the relevant customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, and, if applicable, process and remit your actual Import Fees for such item (the &quot;Designated Carrier&quot;). This Import Fees Estimate amount remitted by you will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse the Designated Carriers for the Import Fees that they have paid on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The Import Fees Estimate may or may not include customs duties. If they do not include customs duties, you will be responsible for making arrangements with the customs authorities for payment of duties. The Import Fees Estimate may be more or less than the final actual amount of Import Fees due and payable. We have no control over the Import Fees and cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what the final actual amounts may be. For greater certainty, you should contact your local customs office for further information on the Import Fees that may be applicable to your purchase. You agree and acknowledge that (a) the actual Import Fees may be more or less than the Import Fees Estimate and (b) you will NOT receive any refund in the case that the actual Import Fees are less than the Import Fees Estimate; however, if additional Import Fees are owing, you are solely responsible for remitting such Import Fees to the appropriate authorities.</li>\n<li>Where your credit card is rejected for any reason, you will be responsible for any fees and charges associated with such rejection, as well as interest on the amount owing. Interest will be the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, commencing on the date that your credit card was rejected. Thalmic may, in its sole discretion, delay shipment of, or cancel, your Thalmic Product order where your credit card is rejected.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>RETURNS</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A Thalmic Product purchased through the Site may be returned to Thalmic for a refund of Thalmic Product and applicable taxes, excluding shipping costs, within thirty (30) days of delivery.

By placing your order, you agree to allow us to collect the Import Fees Estimate for the applicable items in your order. With respect to each item to which an Import Fee Estimate applies, you authorize us to designate a carrier to act as your agent with the relevant customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, and, if applicable, process and remit your actual Import Fees for such item (the \"Designated Carrier\"). This Import Fees Estimate amount remitted by you will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse the Designated Carriers for the Import Fees that they have paid on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The Import Fees Estimate may or may not include customs duties. If they do not include customs duties, you will be responsible for making arrangements with the customs authorities for payment of duties. The Import Fees Estimate may be more or less than the final actual amount of Import Fees due and payable. We have no control over the Import Fees and cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what the final actual amounts may be. For greater certainty, you should contact your local customs office for further information on the Import Fees that may be applicable to your purchase. You agree and acknowledge that (a) the actual Import Fees may be more or less than the Import Fees Estimate and (b) you will NOT receive any refund in the case that the actual Import Fees are less than the Import Fees Estimate; however, if additional Import Fees are owing, you are solely responsible for remitting such Import Fees to the appropriate authorities.\r\n    1. Where your credit card is rejected for any reason, you will be responsible for any fees and charges associated with such rejection, as well as interest on the amount owing. Interest will be the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, commencing on the date that your credit card was rejected. Thalmic may, in its sole discretion, delay shipment of, or cancel, your Thalmic Product order where your credit card is rejected.\r\n\r\n1. RETURNS\r\n\r\n    1. A Thalmic Product purchased through the Site may be returned to Thalmic for a refund of Thalmic Product and applicable taxes, excluding shipping costs, within thirty (30) days of delivery. In order to be eligible for refund, returned Thalmic Products must not be damaged by misuse, abuse, or disassembly. Shipping of all returns is your responsibility and at your sole expense. Please consult Thalmic for details about its return procedures. You acknowledge that this 30 day return policy is considered in satisfaction of applicable statutory \"withdrawal rights\" or \"cooling off periods\", and you waive all such statutory rights.\r\n\r\n1. General Product Terms\r\n\r\n    1. These Terms cover order(s) for Thalmic Product(s) made using the Site. Your use of a Thalmic Product is subject to the General Product Terms available at [https://www.thalmic.com/general_product_terms](https://www.thalmic.com/general_product_terms). By using a Thalmic Product (ordered through the Site or otherwise), you agree to the General Product Terms.\r\n\r\n1. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n    1. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all previous agreements relating to the purchase of Thalmic Products from this Site. These Terms may not be altered, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by the duly authorized representatives of both parties. If any one or more of the provisions of these Terms is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, any such provision shall be severable from these Terms. No waiver by either party of a breach or omission by the other party under these Terms shall be binding on the waiving party unless it is expressly made in writing and signed by the waiving party. These Terms, and all Thalmic Product requirements, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario. It is the express will of the parties that these Terms and all related documents be drawn up in English. C’est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.\r\n\r\n1. Contact\r\n\r\n    1.
