				<p>Logitech has today launched two new cases for the Galaxy Tab 3 which come equipped with or without a handy Bluetooth keyboard if required with the folio case. Both protectors are largely on par with their iPad counterparts, although there’s varying levels of compatibility. The Ultrathin Keyboard Folio (shown above) is built solely for the&nbsp;Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, and centers on a Bluetooth keyboard that turns the tablet into a makeshift laptop.

				<p>Last week we saw a photo of Nokia’s new Phablet, the Nokia Lumia 1520, which was previously called the Nokia Bandit, and now it looks like we have a screenshot from the handset. Thanks to a recent post by the ever reliable @evleaks, we might have our first screenshot of Windows Phone 8 running on the Lumia 1520. And wow there is a ton of Live Tiles there! This 6-inch Lumia device is expected to be thin, lightweight, and made [...]</p>

				<p>Acer has already announced the&nbsp;Liquid S2, a&nbsp;smartphone/tablet hybrid with 4K video recording, and has now followed it up with a new&nbsp;Android&nbsp;tablet. The device is the&nbsp;Acer Iconia A3, and it’s all set to go on sale in October. The company has been busy with tablet and tablet hybrid releases this year, and they’ve been quite interesting, from the&nbsp;Iconia W3&nbsp;which runs the full version of&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8, to the twisty&nbsp;Aspire R7. The Android 4.2 flavoured slate will come sporting a 1280×800 (151ppi) display, which [...]</p>
