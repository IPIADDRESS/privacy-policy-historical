        <strong>PERSONS OR PARTIES COVERED </strong><br>
        This Privacy Policy is intended to cover all visitors to   this website, all subscribers to lists or newsletters whether paid or   unpaid, all members or affiliates whether paid or unpaid, and all   customers.  Persons who visit or view this website, whether   intentionally or unintentionally, whether solicited or unsolicited, are   described herein as "Visitors" and are parties to this Privacy Policy.    Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are referred to herein as   "Subscribers" and are parties to the Privacy Policy.  Persons who join   an organization or marketing endeavor (e.g. "affiliates") promoted by   this website are called "Members" herein and are covered by this Privacy   Policy.  Finally, anyone who orders, attempts to order, or receives a   product sold (recipients) or advertised on or delivered from this   website, even at no cost, is called a "Customer" herein and is subject   to this Privacy Policy not only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of   the Purchase Agreement contract.  The website, its agents, owners,   operators, and employees are referred to collectively herein as   "Website," "Site," and/or "Seller".<br>

        <strong><br>
          PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED</strong><br>
        In the event that a person excluded from this website because of the   Terms of Use or from denial of service by the website, who nonetheless   unlawfully views this site, that person remains subject to the terms of   this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of Use<br>
        <br>
        <strong>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE</strong><br>
        This website is not lawfully accessible to persons under the age of 18   or who are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Child Online   Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA).  If you are under the age of 18 you must   leave this site immediately.  Fraudulent use of this website may make   you subject to civil or criminal sanctions.<br>
        <br>

        <strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong><br>
        Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the   consideration required for your right to visit the website.  If you do   not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are   fraudulently using this site.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong><br>
        It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California   Act.  Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address   requirements of the act.  In summary, you must presume that we collect   electronic information from all visitors.  This is not usually   personally identifiable.  If you purchase a product or service via this   website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement   you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect   and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit   and/or transfer that personal information to third parties.  There is no   way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so.    Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or   receive any information about our database.  In the event that the   website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the   requesting party must submit whatever information is demanded by the   website in insure that the website is releasing information to the   correct party.  Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website   from complying.  While we take measures to ensure that outside parties   do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not   warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have   access to your information.  (You should know that merchant service   providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.)  This   Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.  You are   required to read it prior to using the website.  By interacting with the   website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy.    By using the website or purchasing a product through this website, you   waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address   complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration   Association located in a city and county specified herein.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong><br>

        This website routinely collects information about its visitors,   subscribers, members, and customers.  This information is obtained in   various ways, such as:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong><br>
        Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer   takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website.    This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a   newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your   participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information   from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an   affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it   may be from ordering a product. Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the   website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant   service processing.  This information is kept at the highest level of   security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service   provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong><br>
        Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping   cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master   Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete   credit card numbers.  In the process of online ordering, the customer   provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, and,   occasionally a member password.  You should consider all this   information available to the website.  This information is used to   deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve   its use for general solicitation purposes<br>

        <strong><br>
          VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong><br>
        Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under   two conditions:  one, they give their permission for contact by the   website; two, they are subject to any 'submission' provisions of the   Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.  While your   email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the   website's general solicitation database.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong><br>
        If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you   communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects   information about your communication and by communicating with the site   you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise   use any information collected as the site sees fit. Any communication   which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may   be publicized for commercial purposes.<br>
        <br>

        <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong><br>
        Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising,   appearing on this website must assume that information is being   collected about them.  This site is not responsible for the use of   information collected in such a fashion.  Visitors must assume that (1)   information will be collected, (2) that 'cookies' will usually be placed   on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control over   what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no   responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that   website is not responsible for downloads from third party advertisers   that contain viruses or worms or other computer code that causes their   computer or software harm, and (6) that website assumes no   responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click itself or   that the advertiser collects.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</strong><br>
        If you send a friend an email from this site or if you send the url or   one of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that some data is   collected about your IP address or your email address and that of your   friend.  You must assume that referred emails or web pages may appear to   come from your email.  You must accept fully responsibility for   referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site   for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results from said   referrals.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong><br>

        Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any   information provided to the website as part of a survey in which you   participate may be used for general solicitation for commercial purposes   and that such information will be shared with joint venture partners,   affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself for   product design or solicitation purposes.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</strong><br>
        Many websites, including this one, collect information about your   computer, your email address, your IP address.  You must assume that   your web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and   information collected.  This information is not usually of a personal   nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and product   preferences even though the website may or may not have any idea who you   are.<br>
        <br>
        "Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard   drive.  Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of   search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or   use of products sold by the site.  Cookies can also be used to obtain   information about your computer configuration or your use of your   computer.<br>

        <br>
        Cookies can be used to electronically gather information about you.    Again, it may or may not be personal information, but it is information   and by using this site you are expressly giving permission to use   'cookies' and to use the information gathered from their use to benefit   you.  You also give permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use   any information collected for product design, product offers to you, and   general commercial solicitation purposes by this site or joint venture   partners, affiliates, and marketing organizations.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong><br>
        The use of information as described below may or may not be how   information that is collected is customarily used by this site.  While   actual use of any information collected may be used quite   conservatively, you must assume that it is not.  You must assume that   information collected is shared with other persons or entities for   commercial purposes.  While this is uncommon in practice, you must   assume that it is as you make your decision whether or not to view or   interact with this website.  This type of shared information may include   your name, address, phone number, email address and buying habits, as   well as other information.  This information may be used for general   commercial solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to,   rented to, or shared with.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED</strong><br>

        Credit card information or other financial information is not usually   known to the website.  However, in the event that it is made known, that   information is never revealed to anyone except to processing   authorities or law enforcement agencies.  However, the provider of such   information gives express permission to use it in fraud investigation or   for litigation.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC FORUMS</strong><br>
        Visitors, subscribers, members, or customers who use any site provided   bulletin boards or other public forums, such as chat rooms, do so at   their own risk.  You may not assume that the site monitors these   services or protects you in any manner from information you post   publicly or share with anyone else via these services.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>SPAM </strong><br>
        By providing to this website information that forms the basis of   communication with you, such as an email address, you waive all rights   to file complaints concerning unsolicited email or spam from this   website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive   communication from us or other marketing organizations.  However, all   email communication with you shall contain an 'unsubscribe' link where   you may notify the website that you no longer wish to receive   solicitations or information from the website and your name will be   removed from the general solicitation database.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>DATA SECURITY</strong><br>
        This website takes measures to protect its data that contains   information related to you.  However, as a consideration for viewing   this site or interacting with this site in any manner, you waive all   claims of any nature against this site concerning the loss, alteration,   or misuse of information.  You must assume that it is possible for your   personal data to be obtained by others, such as "hackers," and used in   an inappropriate manner that may cause you harm and that you agree that   the site is not responsible for damages to you.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY WITHOUT NOTICE</strong><br>
        This Privacy Policy is dynamic.  It will continually change.  You may   not assume that it remains the same and you agree to check the policy   each time you visit the site for changes.
