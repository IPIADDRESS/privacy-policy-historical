<h5>Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy</h5>
<br>
<p>We at Tiburon Media and our affiliated companies are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any information you share with us by using our web sites.<br><br>



Certain states, such as California, have passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to their residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer?s personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request this information from Tiburon Media by writing to Tiburon Media, 39 Main Street, Tiburon, CA 94920 . Attn: Privacy Rights or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@tiburonmedia.com">privacy@tiburonmedia.com</a>. Tiburon Media is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from you per calendar year.<br>
<br>



Tiburon Media has established the following Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the overall privacy practices of Tiburon Media regarding information we collect on our site or network of web sites and through our other advertising. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tiburon Media does not own or control, or to people that Tiburon Media does not employ.</p> 





<br>
