                    Certain states, such as California, have passed legislation requiring certain specific

                    information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any
                    business that discloses a customer?s personal information (as defined by the act)
                    to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method
                    for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone
                    who might have received that personal information. If you are a California resident

                site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site.<br>
                <br>
                Tiburon Media may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies
                to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures
                to collect your non-personally identifiable information.

                    Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</div>
                In addition, we may collect information that you choose to provide to us when requesting
                additional information from us or from one or more of our clients. Examples of personally
                identifiable data that you may provide to us include name, address, phone and email
                address. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect
                to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes
                other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth
                below

                    How Collected Information is Used</div>
                The non-personally identifiable information that Tiburon Media collects is used
                for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content
                in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is
                also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads
                perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.<br>
                <br>
                If you elect to provide Tiburon Media with personally identifiable information,
                we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result
                in follow-up communications from Tiburon Media and from our clients. In addition,
                that information may be combined with information collected from other sources to
                assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other Tiburon
                Media sales and marketing efforts.
                <div class="pages_heading_text">
                    Sharing Information with Third Parties</div>
                All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence
                by Tiburon Media . There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable
                and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described
                below.<br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                When you request information from Tiburon Media or one or more of our clients, we
                may transfer that information within Tiburon Media or route your information to
                our client(s), so that they may provide the information on their product or service.
                <br>
                <br>
                We may also disclose information to an affiliate or third party who provides services
                we deem relevant. In such situations, you will always be provided with an opportunity
                to opt-out of receiving this information. Please be aware that Tiburon Media is
                very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others,
                there is also the possibility that Tiburon Media , or part(s) of our parent company,
                may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such
                transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected
                personally identifiable information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, Tiburon Media may share your information as necessary to comply with a
                court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.
                <div class="pages_heading_text">
                    Security</div>
                Wherever your personally identifiable information may be held within Tiburon Media
                or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect
                the information you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please
                note that while Tiburon Media will make every reasonable effort to protect your
