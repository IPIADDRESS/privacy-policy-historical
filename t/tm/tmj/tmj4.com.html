					<a name="whattypes"></a>
					<p> <strong>What types of Personal Information do we collect about  you?</strong></p>
					<p> We ask you  to provide various types of Personal Information to enhance your experience on  our Sites. The more information you provide, the better we are able to  customize your experience. The types of Personal Information our Sites may  collect include your full name, postal address, email address, telephone number  (wireline or mobile), fax number, birth date, gender, occupation, household  income, purchasing preferences, personal interest activities, bank/debit/credit  card information, username and password for the Site, and other Personal Information  that you actively provide to us via our Site, email, or offline via telephone,  facsimile, postal mail, or in-person. </p>
					<a name="actively"></a>
					<p> <strong>How do we actively collect and use Personal Information?</strong></p>
					<p> Generally,  we actively collect Personal Information from you when you complete online  forms or otherwise affirmatively and voluntarily provide such information to  us. Our Site collects information in different ways, including but not limited  to when you participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers,  and surveys; subscribe to our online services or features, such as news,  weather and traffic alerts; register for our newsletters, other publications  and loyalty clubs; download podcasts; purchase products or services through our  shopping service; communicate with us via email; or apply for employment with  us. <em></em> </p>
					<p> We use your Personal Information in many ways,  including but not limited to when we deliver email, facsimile and other direct  marketing communications to you regarding special product offers, sales,  promotions, or other information about our or our affiliates or our advertisers,  sponsors, and promotional partners (collectively, "Advertisers") products and  services, provided that you have given us your  consent at the time we collect your Personal Information; administer sweepstakes, contests, games or other  promotional programs or activities and notify winners of such programs or  activities; provide you with  valuable online services, such as news, weather and traffic alerts; respond to  your questions or provide other requested information; notify you of important  changes in the functionality of our Sites or other notices related to the  handling of your Personal Information; and evaluate  your qualifications for employment.</p>
					<p><strong>Your Personal Information will be collected and used for the following features, services and  activities:</strong></p>
					<p><strong><u>Loyalty Awards or  Membership Program</u></strong></p>
					<p> Our  stations' loyal listeners and viewers may join our loyalty award or membership  programs to receive information about various station activities, on-air  personalities, programming, contests and sweepstakes, local events, and  promotional offers or ads from advertisers and sponsors via email and/or mobile  devices. You will be required to submit your name, age or date of birth,  gender, postal address and/or email address.</p>
					<p><strong><u>Contests, Sweepstakes  and Promotions</u></strong></p>
					<p> We  conduct various contests, sweepstakes and promotions over the air, online and  at remote locations. Certain contests, sweepstakes or promotions are only for  members of our Loyalty Awards or Membership programs. Depending on the type of  contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you will be required to submit your name,  age or date of birth, gender, postal address and/or email address. Additional non-Personal Information may be  requested depending on the nature of the activity and such information may be  associated with your Personal Information.  If the activity is conducted online, we do not knowingly collect the  Personal Information from a person under the age of 13 and we will delete such  information, to the extent technically possible, in the event we discover or  have knowledge that a child has registered for an online contest, sweepstakes  or other promotional activity. Persons  that falsify their contest/sweepstakes entry for any reason will immediately  forfeit any prize, benefit or compensation. </p>
					<p>For  all contests and sweepstakes, you may need to show state-issued identification  to verify your identity and eligibility if you are selected to be a  winner. If you win a prize valued at  $600 or more, or have won in one calendar year prizes that are valued at $600  or more in the aggregate, you must also provide your social security number and  complete the required IRS Form W-9 for federal tax reporting. </p>
					<p><strong><u>Specialized Features</u></strong></p>
					<p> We  offer several specialized features such as automotive and sports related  websites, often in conjunction with JCI Affiliates or non-affiliated third  parties. To join or subscribe to these  specialized features or websites, you may be requested to submit your name,  postal address and billing address (if different than delivery address), email  address, age or year of birth, and/or gender.  If a specialized feature or website is provided by both JBG and a JCI  Affiliate or a third party, both entities will own and use your Personal  Information consistent with their individual privacy policies.</p>
					<p> We may also provide our users and/or members with the opportunity to weigh-in  on local or national issues or share personal interests by participating in a  survey or a questionnaire. We may  collect your email address and other information related to the subject matter,  such a politics, travel, sports, food, education, or medical information. Some  surveys or questionnaires may also be anonymous, meaning you do not have to  submit your name or email address. </p>
					<p><strong><u>User Generated  Content (UGC)</u></strong></p>
					<p> Users  of our Sites may submit news tips, story suggestions, audio, video,  photographs, animation and other content for various features on these Sites or  for offline purposes such as a resource for our broadcast stations and  entertainment features. Depending on the  nature of the UGC, you may be required to complete a registration process,  which may require the submission of your name, email address, telephone number,  city, state and zip code. Our news  editors or reporters, at their discretion, may contact a user for additional  information related to the user and/or the user's content. </p>
					<p><strong><u>Classified  Advertising</u></strong></p>
					<p> Companies and individuals may place classified ads in various  Journal publications via online, postal mail or courier, in person and/or  telephone. We will collect your  name, name of the business entity placing the ad (if any), email address,  telephone number, billing address, and credit card account or check payment information. Upon entry of  your credit card number into our secured system, whether the number is  collected offline or online, the credit card account number is encrypted and  retained until your account is cancelled and deleted. For your convenience, if you have an active  account and wish to renew or extend your advertising schedule, or purchase new  ads, only authorized personnel has access to your payment information from a  past transaction by using the last four digits of your credit card account  number.</p>
					<p> <strong><u>General Advertising</u></strong></p>
					<p> For  entities that purchase broadcast advertising or other advertising and marketing  opportunities, we will collect your name, name of the  business entity placing the ad (if any), email address, telephone number,  billing address, and credit card account or check payment information. Upon entry of your credit card number into  our secured system, whether the number is collected online or offline, the  credit card account number is encrypted and retained until your account is  cancelled and deleted. For your  convenience, if you have an active account and wish to renew or extend your  advertising schedule, or purchase new ads, authorized personnel only has access  to your payment information from a past transaction by using the last four  digits of your credit card account number.</p>
					<p><strong><u>Mobile Marketing</u></strong></p>
					<p> We  provide commercial marketing and advertising opportunities,  contests/sweepstakes, and alerts for news, sports, and weather delivered via  mobile devices. You must subscribe to a  mobile service or request that we send such information to you via a text  message or a wireless voice call. Depending on the type of mobile subscription  service, you will be asked to submit your name, age or date of birth, mobile  telephone number, and/or standard email address. We do not request submission of a wireless  email address and if we collect such information inadvertently for a marketing  or advertising opportunity, we will attempt to notify you and request a  standard mobile telephone number that does not have a wireless domain name  attached to it. You have a right to  opt-out of any mobile service in the same manner in which you registered or by <a href="#contact">notifying our Privacy Administrator</a>.</p>
					<p><strong><u>Marketing Via Fax</u></strong></p>
					<p> We  may send commercial advertising and promotional material via facsimile to our  businesses that the JBG or any of its radio or television stations have an  existing business relationship with. We  require affirmative consent from the recipients of a commercial fax or we will  respond to an inquiry or invitation to send a commercial fax. We may also fax material that is primarily  informational or transactional, however, such material is not deemed to be  commercial and does not require either an existing business relationship or  affirmative consent. You have a right to  opt-out of any commercial fax by following the opt-out instructions on these Sites  or on the first page of the fax.</p>
					<p><strong><u>Contact Us</u></strong></p>
					<p> If  you use our Sites' email address hyperlink or telephone number to contact us,  we may ask for your name, email address and/or telephone number. <strong><u>We will not ask for, nor should you send  any sensitive or confidential Personal Information via email, such as social  security number, credit card account number, or a driver's license number.</u></strong> If you receive an email requesting any such  information from us or someone that claims they are with the JBG, please <a href="#contact">contact our Privacy Administrator</a> immediately.</p>
					<p>If  you send correspondence to us that pertains to our broadcast operations or  programming, we are required by federal law to place all such correspondence in  the station's FCC Public Inspection File, which may also be posted  electronically on these Sites. Please see our section titled <a href="#children">"Do we collect Personal Information from or about children?"</a> for details on how we  handle such correspondence from children.</p>
					<p>Our Sites  may also enable you to submit Personal Information about other people. We may collect Personal Information about other people from  you when you participate in various programs and features or when you submit  news stories or nominations for community awards or recognition that involve  other people. We generally use this  Personal Information to process your request, submission or to investigate and  report news stories. </p>
					<p> We  may also combine your Personal Information with information obtained from JCI  Affiliates, our operational service providers or other companies.</p>
					<a name="children"></a>
					<p> <strong>Do we  collect Personal Information from or about children?</strong> </p>
					<p>We recognize the particular importance of protecting the privacy of  children. We are committed to protecting  children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  We do not generally target children for our goods and services and do  not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of  13. If we discover that a child under  the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us that does not qualify for  any regulatory, legal, or security/safety exemption as described below, or we  are contacted by a verifiable parent or legal guardian about his or her child's  participation on our Sites, we will delete the Personal Information about the  child from our active records and from our systems to the extent technically  feasible. </p>
					<p> We are required by federal law to place all  correspondence from the public related to a station's operations or programming  in the station's FCC Public Inspection File, which may also be posted  electronically on these Sites. If we know that email or other  correspondence is from a child, we cannot delete the correspondence but we reserve  the discretion to remove any Personal Information that could be used to contact  the child from the correspondence before placing it in the FCC Public  inspection File. </p>
					<p> On occasion,  our Sites may enable parents or legal guardians to submit information about  their child under the age of 13 for purposes of participating in programs or  features, such as a weather kids program and contests. In such instances, we only request the types  of Personal Information necessary for participation in the program, which may  include, but is not limited to, the parent's name and email address, child's  name, age, city, and a photograph of the child.  This information would be used only for purposes of the specific program  or feature. </p>
					<a name="passively"></a>
					<p><strong>How do we passively collect and use  information through tracking technology?</strong></p>
					<p> Our Sites passively collect  certain kinds of information that reveal the frequency with which you visit our  Sites, the times and dates of your visits, the pages you reviewed, and other  information, including an Internet protocol (IP) address, which is series of  numbers that identifies the computer you are using. Information is passively collected through  various means. We use IP addresses to  identify server problems, administer our Sites, and compile aggregated  statistics for marketing and research purposes, and to serve customized  advertising or content to you based on your IP address' geographic location. We also use navigational data, including log  files and click-stream data, to identify information about your web browser and  operating system, and the time period in which you visit our Sites or select  pages or areas of our Sites. This information  is also used to improve our Sites' content and is retained anonymously, meaning  that it does not identify an individual user. </p>
					<p>Our Sites use small  text files called "cookies" that are sent to the hard drive of your computer to  store bits of information related to your use of our Sites. Cookies can store a variety of information,  including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer  times, user preferences, shopping cart information and passwords needed to  access our Sites. We may use cookies to  serve customized advertising or content to you based on your submitted zip code,  age, gender, or other demographics. You  may configure your browser to reject cookies.  If you do so, you might not be able to access important functions or  enjoy certain conveniences or customized features of our Sites.</p>
					<p>Our Sites may also use "Web beacons" to help personalize  your experience, similarly to how we use cookies. We may also use Web beacons to gather non-Personal  Information about the number of users who visit our Sites, the areas in which  they spend their time visiting, and other demographic data. </p>
					<p> We  do not ordinarily combine passively collected Personal Information (as  described above) with actively collected Personal Information.<strong> </strong>However,  for Sites' interactive features such as blogs, chat rooms and bulletin boards,  we have the capability to correlate your comment with your IP address and  account in the event you are in violation of the Sites' Terms of Use agreement  or may be subject to a civil or criminal inquiry or investigation. We also reserve the right to  introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques. </p>

					<a name="choices"></a>
					<p><strong>What choices do you have about the collection, use and  sharing of your Personal Information?</strong></p>
					<p>If you do not want to receive email and other  direct marketing communications from us regarding special product offers,  sales, promotions, or other information about JCI Affiliates or our Advertisers'  products and services, you may choose to opt-out of  receiving such communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe links in  certain email communications from us or by otherwise notifying our Privacy  Administrator of your opt-out choice by using our contact information below. </p>
					<p>If we plan to share your Personal Information  directly with non-affiliated third parties such as Advertisers for purposes of  delivering promotional or direct marketing materials directly to you or  providing particular online services to you, you will be asked to provide your  affirmative consent ("opt-in") first. If you have opted in to such use of your  Personal Information, you may withdraw your consent at any time ("opt-out"),  unless there are certain restrictions as stated in this Privacy Policy, Terms  of Conditions of Use, Official Rules or are disclosed in advance. For  withdrawal of your consent please contact us using our information below and we  will take reasonable measures to avoid sharing your Personal Information in the  future. However, please note that non-affiliated  third parties are independent from us, and if you wish to stop all  communications from such third parties, you will need to address such issues  with the third parties directly. </p>
					<a name="thirdpartylinks"></a>
					<p> <strong>What do you need to know about links  to other websites operated by third parties? </strong></p>
					<p> Our Sites contains  a variety of content and functionality and may provide links to other third  party websites, including JCI Affiliate websites. Despite these  linkages or any references to our business and JBG at those websites, this  Privacy Policy applies only to JBG. This  Privacy Policy does not apply to other portions of our internal network or to  any external websites. Please  note that you are solely responsible for your interactions with external  websites and third parties to which our Sites provide you access, such as by  clicking on a link. The presence of a link to a third party website does not  constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the  third party content, goods, services available through, or contained on, the  website or the third party's business or privacy practices. By use of our Sites,  you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to  third party websites at your own risk. </p>
					<a name="update"></a>
					<p> <strong>How can you access, update or delete your  Personal Information?</strong> </p>
					<p> If you wish to update or correct any  Personal Information you have previously provided to us, you may enter your username  and password and access your account via these Sites, or contact us by using our  contact information below. <strong>[ALL DIVISIONS TO CONFIRM SPECIFIC PROCESS]</strong> You may  also request to remove your Personal Information from our Company records to  the extent technically feasible, electronic or otherwise, however, certain  records and Personal Information must be retained for tax or regulatory  purposes. Additionally, our network system  may not allow the deletion of all Personal Information. If we are not able to purge all Personal  Information, we can remove such data from an active field or folder. We will update your  Personal Information where appropriate, and we reserve the right to retain Personal  Information obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions  that we believe are appropriate. </p>
					<p>We also reserve the right to deny access to  any user if we believe there is a question about your identity. And if the burden or expense of providing  access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your  privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide  not to provide access to such information.  In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access  cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries. </p>
					<a name="security"></a>
					<p> <strong>What security measures do we take to  safeguard your Personal Information?</strong> </p>
					<p> The  security and confidentiality of your Personal Information is important to  us. We maintain reasonable physical,  electronic, and managerial procedures to protect your Personal Information. If we collect Sensitive Personal Information  such as credit or debit card account numbers, we will do so using an  industry-standard secured transmission process. However, no security measures  are impenetrable, and transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or  error-free. As a result, we do not, and cannot,  guarantee the security of any Personal Information but we will take reasonable  measures.</p>
					<p>Also,  it is your responsibility to safeguard any username or password that you may  have received in connection with our Sites, and to notify us if you ever  suspect that the security and confidentiality of your username or password and  associated account has been compromised in any way. You are solely responsible for any use of our  Sites via your username and password.</p>

In the event that the  change is significant or material, we will notify such a change by revising the  link on the home page to read "Privacy  Policy - Updated."

If you do not agree to the changes in the  Privacy Policy, you understand, acknowledge and agree that your only recourse  is to stop using our Sites.
