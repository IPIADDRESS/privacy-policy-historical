</p>
<p>
	Your
name, profile pictures, cover photos, sports, username and User ID are treated
just like information you choose to make public.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Public Information</strong></h3>
<p>
	<strong>Information that is always publicly available</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The
types of information listed below are always publicly available, and they are
treated just like information you decided to make public:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>
	Name:</strong> This helps your friends and
family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can
always 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account"><u>delete</u></a> your account.</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Profile Pictures and Cover
Photos:
	</strong>
	These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable
making any of these photos public, you can always delete them. Unless you
delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous
photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album.
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Gender:</strong> This allows us to refer to
you properly.
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Username and User ID</strong>: These allow you to give out
a custom link to your Profile Page and help make TGR Platform possible.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Usernames and User IDs</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Usernames
and User IDs are the same thing – a way to identify you on TGR. A User ID is a
string of numbers and a username generally is some variation of your name. With
your username, you get a custom link that you can give out to people or post on
external websites.
</p>
<p>

	<strong>How we use the information we
receive
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We
use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and
features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the
advertisers that purchase ads on the site, developers, applications, and
websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find
things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	as part of our efforts to
keep TGR products, services and integrations safe and secure;
	</li>
	<li>
	to protect TGR's or others'
rights or property;
	</li>
	<li>
	to provide you with location
features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is
going on nearby;
	</li>
	<li>
	to measure or understand the
effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to
you;
	</li>
	<li>
	to make suggestions to you
and other users on TGR, such as: suggesting that your friend like the same
sports or activities
	</li>
	<li>
	for internal operations,
including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service
improvement.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Granting
us permission to use your information not only allows us to provide TGR as it exists today, but it
also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop
in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
</p>
<p>
	While
you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own
all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't
share information we receive about you with others unless we have:

	received your permission;</li>
	<li>
	given you notice, such as by
telling you about it in this policy; or
	</li>
	<li>
	removed your name and any
other personally identifying information from it.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Of
course, for information
others share about you, they control how it is shared.
</p>
<p>
	We
store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to
you and others, including those described above. Typically, information
associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For
certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention
practices.

<h3>RISK OF LOSS</h3>
<p>
	All items purchased from TGR are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
</p>
<h3>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE</h3>
<p>
	TGR does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center
</p>
<h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
<p>
	TGR attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, TGR does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any TGR Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.

	Except where noted otherwise, the List Price or Suggested Price displayed for products on any TGR represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere. The List Price or Suggested Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day.

</p>

	With respect to items sold by TGR, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced.

Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
