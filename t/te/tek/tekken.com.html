<br>
<a name="emaillists"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">What if I subscribe to an email list?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  We currently have four email lists that may be subscribed to.&nbsp; By default, when a child registers a new user profile, they are not given the option to select any mailing lists (though later a parent may, after registration is completed, add their child to the list).&nbsp; Additionally, all mailing list selections are defaulted to the "no" option, and requires you to select to subscribed to the mailing list.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Site Information List •</b> This is a mailing list that keeps you informed of new information about the website, such as any new features, contests, or other items directly featured on the NAMCOARCADE website.&nbsp; Your name and email address are not shared outside of NAMCO by subscribing to this list.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Outside Entertainment Company List •</b> This is a mailing list that may be sold or provided to companies outside of NAMCO with entertainment related interests.&nbsp; We do require any company to which we provide this list have an easy method by which you can remove yourself from their mailing list should you decide to.&nbsp; We share only your name and email address.&nbsp; We may tailor lists to certain age groups (for instance, 10 to 13, 17 to 24, et cetera), but we do not provide specific age information about any one person.&nbsp; We do keep record of any list that we provide your name to, so if you wish any disclosure of who your information has been shared with, please contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@namcoarcade.com">webmaster@namcoarcade.com</a> for further information.&nbsp; This is the only list we currently have available that would provide any information to an outside company.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Game Sales Update List •</b> We have a list of used games available for sale through many of our locations.&nbsp; By subscribing to this list, you will receive notification of any updates made to the game sales list, as well as any special sales opportunities we may have.&nbsp; Your name and email address are not shared outside of NAMCO by subscribing to this list.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>eGamer Newsletter •</b> This newsletter is aimed at our arcade players, and may feature news and information from outside of NAMCO, however, no information is provided to those companies outside of certain demographics.&nbsp; This newsletter is not currently published, but may be in the future.<br>
<br>
<a name="removelists"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">How do I remove myself from an email list?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Any email list that is used internally (Site Information, Game Sales, or eGamer) will contain a link within that you may click for easy removal from the mailing list.&nbsp; You may also <a href="login_updateuser_main.asp">update your profile</a> and remove yourself from any future mailings.&nbsp; Please understand that you may receive one final email from any of these email lists depending on email delivery delays should your request come after an email has already been sent.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  If you subscribed to the Outside Entertainment Company List, we will remove you from the list immediately upon request (the easiest way is to <a href="login_updateuser_main.asp">update your profile</a>), however, anyone to which your name has been provided prior to that point will still have access to your information in the list we provided.&nbsp; You will need to unsubscribe from any such list through their unsubscribe routine.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  For either, you may provide your username or email address to <a href="mailto:webmaster@namcoarcade.com">webmaster@namcoarcade.com</a>, and request that we remove you from a specific list, or from all lists, and we will do so.<br>
<br>
<a name="dob"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">Why do you need my date of birth?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Your date of birth is required to ensure that we meet with the requirements of the Childrens' Online Privacy Protection Act.&nbsp; We do not provide your date of birth outside of the company.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  We may build demographic information about our uses from time to time, and may provide that information outside of the company.&nbsp; However, we only compile general information (for instance, 35% of our users are aged 16 to 24).<br>
<br>
<a name="feedback"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">What do you do with the information I provide on your feedback form?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  We use the information that you provide only to contact you about any specific item or issue that you have contacted us about, and will only continue to contact you through the resolution of any such item.&nbsp; We do not add your name or email address to any sort of mailing list, and once the issue is resolved, we do not contact you further unless you contact us again in the future.<br>
<br>
<a name="contests"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">Why do you need my address for contests?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Any contests that we run through NAMCOARCADE will allow you to register to win as long as you meet the requirements of the contest (each contest will have specific guidelines).&nbsp; Should you win the contest, we will need your address to send your prize to you.&nbsp; We do have procedures (which may differ from contest to contest, and would be detailed in that contest's guidelines) that ensure parental involvement in any contest that a child might enter.<br>
<br>
<a name="outsideaddress"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">What do you mean when you ask if you may share my address with outside companies?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  We may from time to time provide outside companies with related interests mailing lists built from information we have collected.&nbsp; We only provide the information of people who have expressed a willingness to be contacted in such a manner.&nbsp; If you do not wish to be contacted, simply check the "no" box on any form that asks such a question.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>If you wish to be removed from future possible mailing lists,</b> and you have granted us permission in the past, simply contact us via <a href="mailto:webmaster@namcoarcade.com">webmaster@namcoarcade.com</a>, or you may send us a written request via US Mail to NAMCOARCADE Mailing Lists, ATTN: Webmaster, NAMCO CYBERTAINMENT INC., 877 Supreme Drive, Bensenville, IL 60106.<br>
<br>
<a name="cookies"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">What is a "cookie?"</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  A cookie is a piece of information stored on your computer that has been placed there to keep track of certain information or settings relevant to this website.&nbsp; We primarily use what are known as "session cookies," which are only kept on your computer for the duration of your visit to NAMCOARCADE.&nbsp; We do not store your real name, email address, date of birth, or other personal information in these cookies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  We may also on occasion store your username, date and time of a website function, or other generic information from the website to a cookie on your system.<br>
<br>
<a name="ip"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">What is an IP address, and do you store it?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Your IP address is basically a number that identifies you on the internet which is unique to your internet service provider.&nbsp; On any form we receive, as well as any post to our forum, or user registration, we store your IP address either in standard or encoded form, depending on who has access to that information within our company.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  IP address information and activity logs may be provided to the internet service provider who continually abuses the services available at NAMCOARCADE.<br>
<br>
<a name="parent"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">I am a parent.&nbsp; What information do you collect about my child, and what if I no longer wish you to use any information collected?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  We collect your child's name, email address, and date of birth, as well as allow them to choose a username and password during initial registration.&nbsp; By default, any child's profile is set to have any email list settings set to "no" until a parent may review their profile.&nbsp; Any contest or forum use does not occur at the time of registration, and requires a completed profile in order to access either.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Parents, at the conclusion of the child registration process, are provided a password that is required to make any adjustments to the child's profile.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  If you wish to have your child's information removed, you may either <a href="login_delete_request.asp">visit the profile deletion page</a> or email a request to <a href="mailto:webmaster@namcoarcade.com">webmaster@namcoarcade.com</a> with your child's username, and we will contact you to confirm the deletion of the information.<br>
<br>
<a name="childreg"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">Why does my child have to register a profile with you?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Profile registration is only required to enter contests (when available), participate in our discussion forums, or to join any of our mailing lists.&nbsp; A child's registration will generate a parental approval form that may be faxed or emailed to us to confirm your consent for your child to have an active profile with us.<br>
<br>
<a name="questions"><b><i><font color="#FFFF66">What if I have additional questions that are not answered here?</font></i></b></a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  You may contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@namcoarcade.com">webmaster@namcoarcade.com</a>, <a href="feedback.asp">our feedback form</a>, or via mail or phone as provided elsewhere on this page.&nbsp; We will endeavor to answer any questions to the best of our ability.</p></td>
