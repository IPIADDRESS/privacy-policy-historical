<p>Tektronix, Inc. has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our company's commitment to privacy. Your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern. </p>

<p>When you visit any Tektronix, Inc. Web site, we help you maintain control over your personal data on the Internet. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet sites.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#info">Information Gathering and Usage</a></li>
<li><a href="#cookies">Cookies and Web Beacons</a></li>
<li><a href="#managing">Managing Your Information</a></li>

<a name="info"></a><h4>Information Gathering and Usage</h4>

<p>Tektronix gathers information about you from data that you provide through such things as optional or mandatory registration, online surveys, and contests. The types of personal information collected can include name, mailing address, phone number, email address, transaction and credit card information. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information such as your job function, industry, application, contact preferences or experience with our products.  Tektronix may enhance or merge your information collected on our site with other operational data as well as data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to your needs.</p>

<p>The information you provide will be used to support your professional relationship with Tektronix and our products. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on Tektronix, Inc. Web sites and alert you to information on our products, services and programs. We also use this information to help you complete a transaction and in some cases to contact you for market research.</p>

<h5>Links to Other Sites</h5>

<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Tektronix. Links to other sites will open in a new browser window. Please be aware that Tektronix is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

<h5>Message Boards/Forums</h5>

<p>This Web site may make forums and message boards available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

<h5>Electronic Newsletters</h5>

<p>Tektronix offers various free electronic newsletters. Users can sign up by clicking on the "Get customized email updates" button on the homepage.  We don't spam, never sell or rent email addresses, and there's an easy unsubscribe in every email you'll receive.  Alternately users may remove themselves from mailing lists by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@tektronix.com">privacy@tektronix.com</a>.</p>

<h5>Contests</h5>

<p>Tektronix offers contests in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address. In some cases, the entrant must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of technical interests and personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity and eligibility, to contact winners or prize recipients, and to market and sell our products. Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event.</p> 

<h5>Forward to a Friend Feature</h5>

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  Your email address will appear as the sender of the email and we will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Both your email address and the recipient's email address will not be used for any other purpose except to facilitate the sending of this one-time email to your friend.  Tektronix stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<h5>Log Files</h5>

<p>Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to automatically log information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We log this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. For areas of our site that require registration, we log the user's email address and specific information concerning the user's activity on the site.  This information may be tied to the user's other personal information and, if so, it is used to support the user's professional relationship with Tektronix and our products.  </p>

<a name="cookies"></a><h5>Cookies and Web Beacons</h5>

<p>Cookies are used to enhance your experience on our sites by allowing us to tailor our content based on your interests.

In the case of registering or logging on, we track information necessary to be able to follow up through contacting you.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent. Although rejection of cookies will not interfere with your ability to interact with most of our site, you will need to accept cookies if you choose to enter areas of our site that require registration or log on.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners and software vendors use cookies on our site (e.g., for site analytics). While Tektronix strives to protect the private information of our site users and thoroughly reviews the security and privacy practices of our site partners, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

Web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. Processing this information helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.</p>

<p>In addition, we use Web beacons in some of our HTML-based emails to let us know what percentage of emails are opened by the recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>

<h5>Information Sharing</h5>

<p>Tektronix will not share, sell or rent your personal information for promotional purposes and will not disclose your personal information to outside organizations unless they are affiliated with Tektronix. Distributors, rental partners, affiliates, contractors, or other business partners of Tektronix who have access to your personal information use the information in connection with your customer relationship with Tektronix and our products. Contractors use the information to fulfill Tektronix' requirements for such things as processing credit card purchases, shipping goods to customers, and providing information to potential customers.</p>
