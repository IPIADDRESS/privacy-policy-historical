<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In

<p><b>Other Websites</b></p>
<p>Our web site may contain links to enable you to visit other web 
	sites of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our 
	site you should note that we do not have any control over that other web site. 
	Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any 
	information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not 
	governed by this Privacy Statement. You should exercise caution and look at the 
	Privacy Statement applicable to the web site in question.</p>
<p><b>How we use cookies</b></p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on 
	your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, your browser adds that text in a 
	small file. A cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit 
	a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an 
	individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes 
	and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. 
	For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easier to 
	shop, by allowing you to place things into a shopping basket; the basket itself 
	is not the cookie, the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of 
	your basket versus others in use at the same time. A cookie in no way gives us 
	access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you 
	choose to share with us. This practice is strictly in force. We know that 
	people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both 
	gain from their proper use is worthwhile. You may set your web browser 
	(Microsoft internet explorer or Netscape navigator) to notify you of cookie 
	placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that 
	contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your internet browser.
