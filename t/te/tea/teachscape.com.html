            <h3>Your Privacy. It Matters.</h3>

<p>Teachscape, Inc. ("Teachscape", "we" or "us") understands that individuals with whom we conduct business value their privacy. Protecting your privacy is important to us. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Teachscape Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>

<p>In general, you can visit the public areas of our website (the "Site") without divulging any personal information. However, there are areas of our Site that require this information to complete their customization functions. These areas are accessible only by registered users, and are known as the "Registered User Areas". Use of the Registered User Areas is prohibited unless you are a registered user, and may not be available to those choosing not to reveal the information requested.</p>

<h3>Why We Collect Personal Information</h3>

<p>Teachscape collects and uses your personal information to customize your experience on our Site, to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, to respond to your requests for products or services, and to make a wider range of our products and services available to you. Persons with access to your user information may include agents of Teachscape who help us to provide services to you.</p>

<p>In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you would like to hear about. Lastly, we may use the information gathered when you register to use the Registered User Areas (and when you use those areas) for demographic, research and other analytical purposes. We may combine the information we collect with information from other sources. Some of the research and analysis we perform will be shared with potential clients, educational institutions and systems, service providers and government agencies; however, we will not identify you personally to any outside party with regard to any such information.</p>

<h3>How We Collect Personal Information</h3>

<p>We collect information about you in several ways. We might ask for your contact information when you register with our Site, correspond with us, participate in one of our chat or online communities, call us to request service, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. At certain points throughout our Site, we might ask for your name, e-mail address, and other contact information. In order to access the registered areas of our Site, you are required to enter your username and password.</p>

<h3>When We Disclose Personal Information</h3>

<p>As a general matter, most of the information that we gather about you will be used for our internal purposes only. At times we may share information regarding your use of our Site with your master licensee (e.g., your educational institute or school district) or the group through which you were provided access to our Site. Some of the research and analysis we perform will be shared with potential clients, educational institutions and systems, service providers and government agencies; however, we will not identify you personally to any outside party with regard to any such information.</p>

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, at times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary for the protection of Teachscape or its rights, or the public.</p>

<h3>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Teachscape uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information. If you are a registered user, remember to sign off of our Site and close your browser window when you are finished to ensure that others cannot pose as you online. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the internet. Change your password often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>

<h3>Access to Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>You always have access to the information we have about you. If you would like to review other personal information that we may have about you, or to opt-out of future communications, email us at info@teachscape.com.</p>

<h3>Collection of Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>When you browse the unregistered areas of our Site, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information when you browse such areas. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.</p>

<p>Like many websites, the Teachscape Site uses "cookie" technology. When you first connect to our Site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which areas of our Site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns so we can make our Site even better.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>

<p>Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content of such websites, and your use of the websites is subject to the privacy policies of those sites.</p>

<h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

<p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to prevent, through a cost-free means, sharing of your personal information with third-parties for their own marketing purposes. If you send a written request to Teachscape, Inc., 655 Montgomery St, 8th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94111, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, Teachscape will provide you with a California Customer Choice Notice that you can use to opt-out of such information sharing. Please allow thirty days for response.</p>

<h3>Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy</h3>

<p>To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Teachscape employee.</p>

<p>If we are going to use any personal information we have collected in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will publish notice of such use on the Site.</p>

<p>The site is not directed to children, and Teachscape does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under 13.</p>

<p>The Teachscape Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your use of the Site after any such change means you agree to the Privacy Policy as changed.</p></article>
