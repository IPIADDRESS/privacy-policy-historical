		TeacherTube</b> provides this Privacy Notice to help 
		you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the
		<b>TeacherTube</b> Sites.</p><p>Your use of the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites and any 
		personal information you provide on the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites remains subject to the terms of this Privacy 
		Notice and our <a href="http://www.TeacherTube.com/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>.</p><p>Please note that any video, image, or other content posted at the 
		direction of Users onto the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites 
		becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable 
		information subject to this Privacy Notice.</p><h2>The Information <b>TeacherTube</b> Collects</h2><ul>
			<li><b>User Provided Information:</b> You provide certain personally 
			identifiable information (such as your name and email address) to <b>
			TeacherTube</b> when choosing to participate in 
			various activities on the <b>TeacherTube</b> 
			Sites such as uploading videos, posting messages in our forums or in 
			the video comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking 
			advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to 
			newsletters or other mailing lists.  </li><br>

			<li><b>Cookies Information:</b> When you visit the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites, we may send one or more cookies - 
			a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - 
			to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. TeacherTube uses 
			both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie 
			remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used 
			by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies 
			can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A 
			session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your 
			browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to 
			indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the
			<b>TeacherTube</b> Sites may not function 
			properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </li><br>
 
			<li><b>Log File Information:</b> When you use the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites, our servers automatically record 
			certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit 
			any website. These server logs may include information such as your 
			web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser 
			language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of 
			clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of 
			those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date 
			and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely 
			identify your browser.  </li><br>

			<li><b>Clear GIFs Information:</b> When you use the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites, we may employ "clear GIFs" 
			(a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage 
			patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a 
			non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use 
			clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which 
			emails are opened by recipients. </li>
		</ul><h2>The Way <b>TeacherTube</b> Uses Information</h2><ul>
			<li>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through 
			the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites, then we use your 
			personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the 
			features and functionality of the <b>TeacherTube</b> 
			Sites.  </li><br>

			<li>Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily 
			disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, 
			within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available 
			and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your 
			email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or 
			send messages through the <b>TeacherTube</b> 
			Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. 
			Any videos that you submit to the <b>TeacherTube</b> 
			Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media 
			channels, and may be viewed by the general public.  </li><br>

			<li>We do not use your email address or other personally 
			identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages 
			without your consent or except as part of a specific program or 
			feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We 
			may, however, use your email address without further consent for 
			non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of 
			major <b>TeacherTube</b> Site changes or for 
			customer service purposes).  </li><br>

			<li>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain 
			non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User 
			usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, 
			etc.) to improve the quality and design of the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites and to create new features, promotions, 
			functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User 
			preferences and trends.  </li><br>

			<li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) 
			remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during 
			your visit or the next time you visit the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content 
			and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing 
			campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of 
			visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, 
			submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. 
			</li>
		</ul><h2>When <b>TeacherTube</b> Discloses Information</h2><ul>
			<li>We provide personally identifiable information and 
			non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, 
			affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose 
			of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these 
			parties agree to process such information in compliance with our 
			privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of 
			such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and 
			security measures.  </li><br>

			<li>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such 
			as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for 
			their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as 
			part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the 
			ability to opt-in or opt-out.  </li><br>

			<li>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as 
			anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform 
			types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to 
			assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, 
			services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the <b>
			TeacherTube</b> Sites. <br>
 </li>
			<li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or 
			non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, 
			or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply 
			with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond 
			to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. <br>
 </li>
			<li><b>TeacherTube</b> also reserves the right 
			to disclose personally identifiable information and/or 
			non-personally-identifiable information that <b>TeacherTube</b>believes, in good faith, is appropriate or 
			necessary to enforce our <a href="http://www.TeacherTube.com/terms.php">
			Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate 
			and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to 
			assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or 
			integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or 
			personal safety of <b> TeacherTube</b>, our 
			Users or others. </li>
		</ul><h2>Your Choices</h2><p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable 
		information through the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites, in 
		which case <b>TeacherTube</b> may not be able to 
		provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal 
		profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your 
		account profile page. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to 
		the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites cannot be removed and 
		remain subject to our <a href="http://www.TeacherTube.com/terms.php">Terms of 
		Use</a>.</p><p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such 
		as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting 
		you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for 
		maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information 
		at all times.</p><h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2><p><b>TeacherTube</b> allows other companies, called 
		third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within 
		the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites. These third-party ad 
		servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, 
		the advertisements and links that appear on the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when 
		this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, 
		JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their 
		advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p><p><b>TeacherTube</b> does not provide any 
		personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or 
		ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program 
		or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. 
		However, please note that if an advertiser asks TeacherTube to show an 
		advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or 
		audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain 
		channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the 
		advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the 
		audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use 
		information regarding your use of the TeacherTube Sites, such as the number 
		of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable 
		information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p><p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these 
		third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more 
		information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of 
		certain practices. <b>TeacherTube's</b> privacy 
		policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such 
		other advertisers or web sites.</p><h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2><p><b>TeacherTube</b> uses commercially reasonable 
		physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity 
		and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or 
		warrant the security of any information you transmit to <b>TeacherTube</b> and you do so at your own risk. Once we 
		receive your transmission of information, <b>TeacherTube</b> makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the 
		security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a 
		guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, 
		or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial 
		safeguards.</p><p>If <b>TeacherTube</b> learns of a security 
		systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that 
		you can take appropriate protective steps. <b>TeacherTube</b> may post a notice on the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where 
		you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security 
		breach in writing. </p><h2>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2><p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For 
		that reason, <b>TeacherTube</b> does not knowingly 
		collect or maintain personally identifiable information or 
		non-personally-identifiable information on the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites from persons under 18 years of age, and no part 
		of our website is directed to persons under 18. If you are under 18 
		years of age, then please do not use or access the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites at any time or in any manner. If <b>TeacherTube</b> learns that personally identifiable 
		information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected on the
		<b>TeacherTube</b> Sites without verified parental 
		consent, then TeacherTube will take the appropriate steps to delete this 
		information.</p><h2>Special Note to International Users</h2><p>The <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites are hosted in the 
		United States and are intended for and directed to Users in the United 
		States. If you are a User accessing the <b>TeacherTube</b> Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other 
		region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, 
		and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised 
		that through your continued use of the TeacherTube Sites, which are governed 
		by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our
		<a href="http://www.teachertube.com/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>, you are 
		transferring your personal information to the United States and you 
		consent to that transfer.</p><h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2><p>In the event that <b>TeacherTube</b> is acquired 
		by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of 
		these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have 
		collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or 
		other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, 
		insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit 
		of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles 
		affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how 
		your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p><h2>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</h2><p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be 
		reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to 
		stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal 
		information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when 
		we received the personal information you provided. Your continued use of 
		the TeacherTube Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and 
		any future revisions.</p><p>For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less 
		restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you 
		have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent 
		before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.</p><p><b>Date Last Modified:</b><br>
