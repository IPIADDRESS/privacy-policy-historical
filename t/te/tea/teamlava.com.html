<p class="p4">TeamLava, LLC, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“TeamLava” or “we”) provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of (i) the website located at <a href="http://%22"><span class="s1">http://www.teamlava.com</span></a> (the “Site”), including any services, features and content accessible or downloadable from the Site, and (ii) any other TeamLava application, service or product licensed, downloaded or otherwise accessed by such users through third party websites or sources ((i) and (ii) collectively, the “Service”).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Acceptance and Consent:</b></p>
<p class="p4">By registering for a user account that enables you to post to the Forums (the “Account”), and/or using the Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and non-personal information by TeamLava in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the Service.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Changes to the Privacy Policy:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="p4">TeamLava reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changed or modified version of the Privacy Policy on the Site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Any such changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will change the Last Revised date above.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Information Collection and Use:</b></p>
<p class="p4">Our primary goals in collecting and using information are to provide and improve the Service, to administer and assist you in administering your Account on the Service, and to provide you with a better experience with the Service.  We store and process information in the United States.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Personal Information and Non-Personal Information</i></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">TeamLava may collect personal and non-personal information from you when you use the Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, including, but not limited to, an individual’s name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home address.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Non-personal information is information that is not, on its own, personal information, such as an individual’s zip code, but that may be considered part of an individual’s personal information if combined with other identifiers in a way that enables identification of an individual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Personal information does not include aggregate information, which is data we may collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the Service, from which any personal information has been removed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This Privacy Policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of other non-personal information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all information collected from or about you, including personal information and non-personal information, as “Your Information.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We may collect your personal information, including your email address, in connection with your creation of an Account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You can register for an Account via a TeamLava application. Certain of Your Information, such as your username and other information, may always be publicly visible by other users of the Forums, including when such users view your Account profile page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Your email address will not be publicly visible unless you choose to make it visible in your Account profile page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>When you register for an Account or later access your Account, you may be able to adjust settings and preferences within your Account to choose whether to share and make publicly visible other pieces of Your Information, and the Service may display Your Information based on the settings and preferences you choose. We encourage you to consider carefully what information to share as part of your Account profile and elsewhere in the Service, and we recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and not use your real name as your username, as that may allow other users of the Service to identify you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Any information you choose to share should reflect how much you want other users of the Service to know about you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You can review and revise your Account profile information at any time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We may also request and collect Your Information when you administer or personalize your Account after registration or otherwise interact with the Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>For example, we may collect Your Information both when you enter promotions on or in connection with the Service as well as in connection with your transactions (such as, but not limited to, donations or the purchase of products) through the Service or with TeamLava’s advertisers.<span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span></span>Such transaction-related information may include payment information, such as information regarding your account with an online payment service provider, and information about your use of products and services offered by our advertisers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">When you launch any of our applications, we collect information regarding your device type, operating system and version, carrier provider, IP address, whether you are using a point package, the game version, and unique device ID.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This unique user ID is stored in connection with your Account profile information to enable us to move Your Information to a new device at your request.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In addition, it may be used to link a character with which you play our games to your username on the Forums.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We may also collect Your Information, such as your name or email address, from third party websites or other sources from which you download or access TeamLava applications, services or products that also make up part of the Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We use your personal information (in some cases, in conjunction with non-personal information) mainly to provide the Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We may combine your personal information with non-personal information and aggregate it with information collected from other users of the Service to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and evaluate how the Service is used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance, by delivering products to you according to your preferences or restrictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We may also use your personal information to contact you with communications such as TeamLava newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We may share aggregate information with third parties with whom we have a strategic relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The information shared with these third parties may be used for industry analysis and demographic profiling.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how the Service is used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>These third parties have access to Your Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and may not use Your Information for any other purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We may also provide Your Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of TeamLava or any third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Log Data and Cookies</i></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">When you browse certain portions of the Service, we may automatically collect and record standard user information and clickstream data about your visit (through the use of cookies and otherwise) as part of our analysis of the use of the Service. For example, when you visit or request a web page from our server, we may record the IP address of the user’s machine, the time, date and URL of the request and information about the browser being used, and other information regarding the visit, such as the pages visited on the Service, the time spent on each page, any advertisements clicked and any search terms used (collectively, “Log Data”).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Log Data may be aggregated and used to monitor and analyze use of the Service and to enable us to analyze traffic and trends, administer and improve the Service, identify and keep track of errors and bugs, and gather broad demographic information to become more familiar with where visits to the Service originate, how often the Service is visited and what parts of the Service are visited most often.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We may also share such information with third party service providers assisting us with the foregoing and with our advertisers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>For example, some of this information may be collected and used so that when you visit the Service again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We may link Log Data to personal information for tracking and analyzing our customers’ use of the Service to help improve the Service, to tailor the Service to their needs and to enforce the Terms of Use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. Like many websites, we also use “cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data, to improve the Service and in some cases to enable you to more easily log in to your Account. We do not use cookies to collect personal information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>However, we may combine information collected through the use of cookies we issue with personal information that you provide to us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>TeamLava may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Service, and to improve the Service and our other products and services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>A session cookie enables certain features of the Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You can instruct your web browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If your browser is set to refuse all cookies, however, some features of the Forums may not function properly. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
