    <p>CollectiveSoft takes your privacy seriously. This policy outlines how we treat the information
    that we collect and receive when you use one of our services, as well as safeguards that we have
    in place to protect your information.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Your Privacy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The data you enter into a CollectiveSoft service belongs to you. We will never sell or share your data.</li>
        <li>We don't share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
        <li>We don't send you unsolicited communications for marketing purposes.</li>
        <li>We or other users of the site may provide links to third party websites, which may have
            different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the
            privacy policies of those third party websites.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Information Collection and Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you register our our site we ask for personal information such as your name, email address,
            and account password. We use the information for identification, authentication, service improvements, and
            research. Your password is stored in encrypted form on our servers so that even we do not know it.
            For certain services, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we transmit
            using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and store in encrypted form.</li>
        <li>When you visit our site, we send one or more cookies—a small file containing a string
            of characters—to your computer so that we can uniquely identify your browser. We use cookies
            to improve the quality of our services, such as allowing you to auto-login to your account,
            and to track usage trends. You will not be able to take advantage of features that
            require you to "sign in" if cookies are disabled.<br>
            <br>
            To the extent that we allows advertisers or other third parties to use cookies on this
            site, we will require that they agree to adopt a substantially similar privacy policy
            with respect to your information.
        </li>
        <li>We may collect personal information if you post messages or comments on our site, or
            if you contact us directly. Posted messages will be saved on our servers and will
            be accessible to the public. Accordingly, to the extent that your message includes
            personally identifiable information, it will be saved on our servers and may
            be available to the public until you delete them.</li>
        <li>Our web logs collect standard web log entries for each page served, including your
            IP address, page URL, and timestamp. Web logs help us to diagnose problems with our
            servers, to administer the site, and to otherwise provide our services to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
    <p>We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies
    except to provide you with services you have requested or when we have your permission.<br>
    <br>
    In the event that we are acquired by or merged with another company we will transfer information
    about you to that other company. In this event, we will notify you before information about you
    is transferred (and permit you to delete your account) and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law;
    if such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes;
    or if your actions violate our <a href="/TermsOfService.htm">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
    <p>We may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the
    way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address specified in your
    account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:admin@collectivesoft.com">admin@collectivesoft.com</a> or write us at
    CollectiveSoft, Customer Care - Privacy Policy Issues, 821 Cole St, San Francisco, CA 94117.</p>
