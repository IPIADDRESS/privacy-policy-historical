</p>
<p>This policy provides information as to the kind of information that we collect through the Website and/or the Apps and the ways we use it.</p>
<h2>National Privacy Principles</h2>
<p>In Australia, we are bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act (1988) (Cth) which govern the handling of personal information.  Personal information can include a person's name, address and any health information (including opinion) about the person.</p>
<p>Visit www.privacy.gov.au, an Australian government privacy website for more information about privacy issues in Australia and protecting your privacy.</p>
<h2>Types of information we collect</h2>
<p>We collect information on visitors to the Website, including information on which areas of the Website are most often accessed and how long visitors visit those areas.</p>
<p>We collect information from the App and your use of it including information to assist us to identify the device upon which you use the App, (such as your device's IP address, operating system and your email addresses), location based data, searches and other information you may input into or access from the App.</p>
<p>We may utilise "cookies" which enable us to monitor such traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the Website. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance. Rejecting cookies may have the effect of limiting your access to parts of the Website.</p>
<p>Personal information may be collected if you choose to register on the Website or use the App. The purpose of the collection of such information is clear from the context in which it is collected, but may include to receive updates and newsletters from us if you so elect.</p>
<p>Where you are required to pay to purchase goods or services from us or third parties through the Website or the App, we (or a financial services provider engaged by us or a third party, such as PayPal) will (or that third party) also collect financial information such as credit card information, your mailing address etc. which may be shared with third parties in order to enable them to provide the goods and/or services purchased by you.</p>
<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
<p>We may collect information about your computer or device, including where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<h2>Protection of personal information</h2>
<p>We use reasonable endeavours to protect personal information and to use and disclose it only as set out in this privacy policy or any other terms and conditions which you have agreed to with us in relation to an App.</p>
<p>The Website's and App's servers are located in a secured data centre with security measures in place.</p>
<h2>Access, use and disclosure</h2>
<p>Our employed staff and contractors engaged by us may have access to personal information that you provide and may access it for purposes that include the audit of content on the Website and Apps for quality control purposes.</p>
<p>Except where otherwise stated by us in this privacy policy or the terms and conditions of our Apps, we will not, without your consent, sell or otherwise provide your personal information to a third party, or make any other use of your personal information, for any purpose which is not incidental to your use of the Website or the App.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information, and you consent to us doing so, to our related parties.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information, and you consent to us doing so, to third parties who are engaged by us to perform functions or provide products and/or services on our behalf, such as financial services providers processing credit cards and mail houses (and businesses performing such functions) and our agents, business partners, joint venture entities or partners, for the purpose of distributing materials which you have consented to receive. We may also need to disclose it if required to conduct any investigation into you or your activities, if for example there is reason to believe that you have committed a breach of our Website or App terms and conditions. We may also disclose such information as required or permitted by any law.</p>
<p>Where, through the use of the Website or App, you identify that you are a member of a club or other organisation, information obtained from you or your device may be shared with those clubs or organisations.</p>
<p>We may make your details or information obtained from you or your device available to third parties for advertising purposes. We won't pass ownership or management of the database details to third parties but we will let advertisers use such information for the purposes of targeting advertisements to you.</p>
<p>If you request us not to use personal information in a particular manner at all, we will adopt reasonable measures to observe your request provided that you cease using and uninstall our Apps, but we may still use or disclose that information if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you do not provide us with adequate time to address your request;</li>
<li>we subsequently notify you of the intended use or disclosure and you do not object to that use or disclosure;</li>
<li>we believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or an agency responsible for government or public security in the performance of their functions;</li>
<li>you continue to use our Apps;</li>
<li>you do not uninstall our Apps; or</li>
<li>we are required by law to disclose the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will preserve the content of any e-mail you send us in relation to the above if we believe we have the legal requirement to do so.</p>
<p>Further, your e-mail message content in general may be monitored by us for trouble-shooting or maintenance purposes or if any form of e-mail abuse is suspected.</p>
<p>Personal information which we collect may be aggregated for analysis but except in circumstances where you expressly or impliedly indicate that you wish to make the information available to others and to identify you, we will use best endeavours to ensure that individuals would remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Unless in using the Website or Apps you expressly or impliedly agree to make certain information available, all personal information which we collect is kept confidential to the best of our ability, subject to the terms of the Apps you use and this privacy policy. You will appreciate, however, that we cannot guarantee the security of transmission as there are always risks associated with transmitting information across the Internet.</p>
<p>In addition, our employees and contractors who provide services related to our Website and Apps are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.</p>
<h2>Sharing with businesses, individuals and clubs we do not control</h2>
<p>We work closely with other businesses, individuals and clubs we do not control. In some cases, such as clubs using our App, these clubs operate stores within the App and/or sell offerings to you via the App or Website. In other cases, we may operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses, individuals and clubs. You can tell when such a third party is involved in your transactions, and we may share your information related to those transactions with that third party.</p>
<h2>Access to your personal information</h2>
<p>You are entitled to have access to any personal information relating to you which you have previously supplied to us over this Website and Apps. You are entitled to edit or delete such information unless we are required by law to retain it.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>If at any time you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that person's consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.</p>
<p>While this website and the Apps are not intended to target minors, we consider it is the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's use of our Website and Apps.</p>
<p>In the event that our business is ever sold, acquired, merged, liquidated, reorganised or otherwise transferred, we reserve the right to transfer to the extent permissible at law, our user databases, together with any personal information and non-personal information contained therein to a third party acquiring the assets.</p>
<h2>Changes to and limitations of this policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Such changes will be updated on the Website and within the Apps following the making of such changes.</p>
<p>The Website and Apps may provide links to other third party sites as a service to our users. Our privacy policy described here does not apply to those sites. Please ensure that you review and agree with the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any linked website before providing any personal information.</p>
