Starting my career in Teambition in May 2016, I have grown from a trainee of pre-sales consultant to a senior CS manager, accumulating rich experience after years of hard work. Thanks to the innovative and vigorous Teambition, many enterprises, big or small, realize agile governance through project collaboration. I enjoy every moment in Teambition when communicating with others equally and delivering best solutions for customers.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.haizhou.title&quot;:&quot;Senior Account Manager&quot;,&quot;careers.members.huaqiao&quot;:&quot;Huaqiao&quot;,&quot;careers.members.huaqiao.intro&quot;:&quot;In Teambition, we use the most sophisticated front-end technologies to find best solutions for complicated application scenarios, looking forward to the best practices of front-end applications. Every time facing difficulties on the road ahead, we can discuss with team members to solve them. What an exciting experience!&quot;,&quot;careers.members.huaqiao.title&quot;:&quot;Senior Front-end Engineer&quot;,&quot;careers.members.jiangyue&quot;:&quot;Yue Jiang&quot;,&quot;careers.members.jiangyue.intro&quot;:&quot;I can still remember my final interview in Teambition. My boss-to-be called me at 8 pm to prepare a whole-year working plan to be reviewed on the next morning. And then the plan was put into practice step-by-step after I was official on board. What happened those days is well within my memory. I cherish the working environment of Teambition in which we come up with ideas and roll up our sleeves to make them into reality.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.jiangyue.title&quot;:&quot;Product Marketing Manager&quot;,&quot;careers.members.jing&quot;:&quot;Jing&quot;,&quot;careers.members.jing.intro&quot;:&quot;Hello, I’m Jing. I joined Teambition because I feel close to the people here even when it’s the first time I meet them. I work to make Teambition essential to everyone’s live. Attracted by its simplicity and beauty, we feel that it's been a pleasure to build it and work with it everyday. Everyone in the team has his or her own expertise and characteristics, but working together, we strive on making Teambition more beautiful to the eyes of our users.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.jing.title&quot;:&quot;Chief Designer&quot;,&quot;careers.members.liqiang&quot;:&quot;Qiang&quot;,&quot;careers.members.liqiang.intro&quot;:&quot;Hello, my name is Qiang Li, co-founder and back-end director of Teambition. I have worked with Junyuan for a long time. We often discuss how to improve collaboration efficiency. Having experienced many domestic and foreign collaboration tools together, we decided to build a simpler and more easy-to-use internal collaboration tool, and Teambition was born. Only by making the tools that you love to use, can you persuade others to use them together. This is my motivation to work every day.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.liqiang.title&quot;:&quot;Co-founder &amp; Technology Director&quot;,&quot;careers.members.lu&quot;:&quot;Lu&quot;,&quot;careers.members.lu.intro&quot;:&quot;My cute friends call me “brother,” but what I really am is just a truly frank woman. My job as an sale is to teach users how to use Teambition effectively. Never bored, even I cannot believe that I consistently feel excited since I was hired. I think I have a heavier responsibility to spread our promises, culture and the idea of how we work to our users. Every accredited user makes me feel confident and passionate. I think that’s what’s that motivates me to work everyday: a strong sense of recognition.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.lu.title&quot;:&quot;Sales&quot;,&quot;careers.members.sichao&quot;:&quot;Bella Zhu&quot;,&quot;careers.members.sichao.intro&quot;:&quot;Returning from my study of CMU at abroad, I have seen different people with different cultures. I always pursue my dream of desirable design. Design is the focus of those young people in the design team of Teambition. I like to work with them. The deep thinking and heat discussions offer lavish inspirations to me.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.sichao.title&quot;:&quot;UI Designer&quot;,&quot;careers.members.title&quot;:&quot;Some people you’ll work with&quot;,&quot;careers.members.wangwei&quot;:&quot;王伟&quot;,&quot;careers.members.wangwei.intro&quot;:&quot;14年销售经验，曾在甲骨文、GE等世界500强公司承担销售管理工作，具有5年互联网云服务行业背景，致力于打造富有激情和专业的销售团队。&quot;,&quot;careers.members.wangwei.title&quot;:&quot;Sales VP&quot;,&quot;careers.members.wei&quot;:&quot;Wei&quot;,&quot;careers.members.wei.intro&quot;:&quot;I love Teambition for its openness. Sharing ideas is part of our culture, and so is implementing them and iterating on them to improve the Teambition experience. As a user experience designer, I take part in building conceptual designs for important parts of our products. This means having the opportunity to be in charge of the design by yourself from conceptualizing to prototyping. In designing things, data scientists and industry research give full support to reference how to design things with users in mind.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.wei.title&quot;:&quot;UX Designer&quot;,&quot;careers.members.xiang&quot;:&quot;Xiang&quot;,&quot;careers.members.xiang.intro&quot;:&quot;The part that I love the most about the Teambition culture is its sense of openness and transparency. We all work towards the same goal: bringing everyone an ideal way to work. Our flat structure encourages us to discuss with honesty and transparency about how we feel and what our opinions are. You can find great colleagues, and also great friends. Working here is always challenging; therefore, the challenges you face leaves you great room to nurture your capabilities. This is not something you find at every company: a culture that makes you improve in such dramatic and bold ways.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.xiang.title&quot;:&quot;iOS Developer &amp; Co-founder&quot;,&quot;careers.members.xiaoshun&quot;:&quot;Xiaoshun&quot;,&quot;careers.members.xiaoshun.intro&quot;:&quot;In 2011, I graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University, and was hired by a state-owned corporation. In three years, I was promoted to be an executive, got married, bought my own house and car, everything you’d expect mummy and daddy would be proud of. I couldn’t be happier right? Well, this is just the beginning of the story, and you can never know what is next. On Fool’s day of 2015, I gave up the position here and joined Teambition, a fairly new start-up with a lot of risks, but a crazy potential. Although frequent overwork and business trips are not avoidable, strangely, I feel deeply peaceful in my mind. What I’m doing is meaningful to a great amount of people, and I can’t be more grateful for the risk I took. Teambition will grow. However, we still think and work with the passion and creativity as we a start-up.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.xiaoshun.title&quot;:&quot;Head of Sales&quot;,&quot;careers.members.yao&quot;:&quot;Yao&quot;,&quot;careers.members.yao.intro&quot;:&quot;I’m Yao Xie, an Android engineer at Teambition. I ended up here attracted by the strong engineering culture. We like to go deep in technology, and we think this is the best way to build the best products in the world. I’m very glad that our Android team grows as quickly as our company does. We also get the time to be able to study open source frameworks we are interested in, and get to decide whether we implement them in our own apps or not. This whole culture is extremely empowering.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.yao.title&quot;:&quot;Android Developer&quot;,&quot;careers.members.yuhan&quot;:&quot;Yuhan&quot;,&quot;careers.members.yuhan.intro&quot;:&quot;Every month we go out with the rest of the design team for an art oriented activity of our choosing.

The sense of friendship is particularly strong. We spend a lot of time together, figuring out how to solve user’s problems, training them, or discussing our best practices or case studies with them. This is the type of job where you get to work in communicating with a lot of people with distinctive backgrounds, various needs and different perspectives. That’s what makes this team empowering.&quot;,&quot;careers.members.zhixu.title&quot;:&quot;Sales&quot;,&quot;careers.members.ziqiu&quot;:&quot;Ziqiu Zhang&quot;,&quot;careers.members.ziqiu.intro&quot;:&quot;We are an outstanding team with sound corporate culture for engineers.
