          <p class="subtitle"> At <strong>Teambox</strong> we develop professional software for thousands of global organizations. Many of our customers are in the <strong>legal, financial services, health care and Government sectors</strong>.<br>The privacy and security of your data <strong>is our main concern</strong>. </p>

              <h3 id="data-at-rest-hosting-security">Data at Rest: Hosting Security</h3>
<p>Teambox’s secure cloud collaboration platform is managed by Engine Yard and is hosted by Amazon Web Services in a highly secure, fully redundant data center which has achieved PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001 certification and has successfully completed multiple SAS70 Type II audits. Teambox servers and data are monitored 24x7 for up-time, availability and intrusion detection. Teambox’s provider stands behind a 99.9% up-time guaranty.</p>

<p>Physical access to our servers is strictly controlled and all precautions are taken including: power redundancy, temperature control and fire detection.</p>

<p>The AWS network provides significant protection against traditional network security issues: packet sniffing by other tenants, Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Man In the Middle (MITM) attacks, etc.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="data-in-motion-network-security">Data in Motion: Network security</h3>
<p>Teambox data always travels over a secure connection. It is encrypted for transfer using SSL and it is only accessible via https (never via http).</p>

<p>Passwords are stored with one-way encryption on our servers meaning that our own internal team can never access a password. Our logging uses 256-bit encryption, the very same high-security standard used in online banking.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="teambox-application-security">Teambox Application Security</h3>
<p>Teambox is designed from the ground up to provide a private and secure environment for each user.</p>

<p>Each user builds a private social network creating different groups of users. Teambox segregates the data for each different group of users so it is not available to non-members of the group.</p>

<p>Users can be invited on two different levels: Organizations and Projects, and can be easily removed anytime. Our role-based permission offers 4 different access levels.</p>

<p>Note that access to your data is forbidden by all Teambox employees (unless permission is granted by you, the customer, in writing, for support purposes).</p>

<p>Unauthorized access of your data by Teambox employees is grounds for immediate termination of employment. All access to data is logged and regularly reviewed by Teambox’s IT department.</p>

            <h4 id="information-we-collect-and-store">Information we collect and store:</h4>
<p>We collect and store the text, information, tasks and files you upload or access with the Teambox Service. When you access Teambox, we may automatically record information from your device, its software, and your activity using the service. This may include your device’s IP address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, location, locale preferences, date and time stamps and other metadata concerning your interactions with the service.</p>

<h4 id="cookies">Cookies:</h4>
<p>We use “cookies” to collect information and improve our services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the service. You can configure your browser by changing its options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to easily access all aspects of the Teambox service and may need to manually enter user and password information.</p>

<h4 id="our-use-of-your-personal-information">Our Use of Your Personal Information:</h4>
<p>In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications.</p>

<h4 id="geo-location-information">Geo-Location Information:</h4>
<p>Some browsers allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services.</p>

<h4 id="third-party-applications">Third-Party Applications:</h4>
<p>We may share your information with a third party application with your consent (Google Docs, Dropbox or similar service), for example, when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>

<h4 id="encryption">Encryption:</h4>
<p>Teambox will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Teambox.</p>

<h4 id="analytics">Analytics:</h4>
<p>We also collect some information (using third party services) using logging and cookies. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, to increase our functionality and user-friendliness. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics and Kiss Metrics.</p>

<h4 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers:</h4>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>

<h4 id="changing-or-deleting-your-information">Changing or Deleting Your Information:</h4>
<p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings.</p>

<h4 id="data-retention">Data Retention:</h4>
<p>Teambox will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account. We will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up.</p>

<h4 id="teambox-community">Teambox Community:</h4>
<p>Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.</p>

<h4 id="changes-to-our-privacy-policy">Changes to our Privacy Policy:</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about security or data privacy on our website or through our service, you should review this entire Security and Data Privacy Policy Page or contact us at <a href="mailto:info@teambox.com">info@teambox.com</a>.</p>
