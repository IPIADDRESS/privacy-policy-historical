<h2>Teaching Channel values the privacy of our users and visitors.</h2>

<p>At Teaching Channel, we understand that you value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience with our site and services, including our content offerings through third-party sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and our newsletters and blogs (referred to in this policy collectively as our "<b>Service</b>" or "<b>Services</b>") is satisfying and safe. This policy describes the information we collect on www.teachingchannel.org, including personal information, in connection with our Services, and explains how we use and disclose this information. By accessing and/or using the Site, you agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and made a part of, the Teaching Channel <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a> (the "<b>Terms</b>"). Capitalized terms used and not defined in this policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at privacy@teachingchannel.org. If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint">TRUSTe here</a>.</p>

<p>The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site www.teachingchannel.org and does not cover information that may be collected through or posted on third party Web Sites.</p>

<h3>What We Collect</h3>

<p>It's our policy to create website content that limits the need for collection of information from our visitors. However, there are various ways you may submit, and we may collect, information.</p>

<blockquote><h4>User-Provided Information</h4>

<p>You may provide to Teaching Channel what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, e-mail address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number or demographic information, billing and/or payment information) when communicating with Teaching Channel or using our Services. Such communication may occur when you register for the Site, request or transmit teaching materials, participate in blogs or discussion groups, take part in our online polls, comment on postings, videos, or our other content offerings, provide your information in submission form provided by Teaching Channel, subscribe to or purchase premium content or services, or otherwise request further communications from Teaching Channel.</p>

<h4>"Cookies" Information</h4>

<p>When you use our Services, we may send one or more cookies -- small pieces of information containing a string of alphanumeric characters -- to your computer.  Teaching Channel may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our Site. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.  Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from our Site, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Site to their fullest potential.</p>

<h4>"Automatically Collected" Information</h4>

<p>When you use our Services, open one of our HTML emails or follow any links embedded in our emails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including standard log files, "clear gifs," "web beacons" or other similar techniques. This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), web browser type and version, device type and unique identifier, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after our Site, search queries you use to find our Site, the pages you view on our Site, and the dates and times that you visit our Site.</p>

<h4>Third Party Web Beacons</h4>

<p>We may also implement third party content, such as advertising, on the Site that uses "clear gifs," "web beacons" or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of that third party content displayed on our Site.  This information is collected directly by the third party, and Teaching Channel does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</p>

<h4>Information from Other Sources</h4>

<p>We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than our Site or Services, such as advertisers, marketers and analytic data collection services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through our Site or Services, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Way We Use Information</h3>

<p>We use all the information you provide, or that we collect or receive, in a variety of ways in connection with the operation of the Site and the Service.  For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Teaching Channel uses the information you provide or that we collect to develop, operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on our Site or Services now and in the future. We will use your email address to contact you for administrative purposes, for customer service purposes, to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues, or regarding User Postings that you have submitted to us.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel uses the information that you provide or that we collect to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way our Services works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel may use "automatically collected" information and "cookies" information, alone or in combination with other information we have collected from you, to streamline and facilitate our provision of the Services, such as to:  (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use our Service; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of our Services and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics, track movements around the Site and analyze trends and demographic information; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to communicate with you in a variety of ways, such as by sending you (i) messages about our Services, such as when you receive communications from another user, (ii) promotional messages about our Services or third-party products you may be interested in, and (iii) communications on behalf of other users who think you may be interested in our Services or certain content available on the Site. Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@teachingchannel.org">privacy@teachingchannel.org</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you should [correct, update, amend, or deactivate it] by making the change on our member information page [or by emailing our Customer Support at privacy@teachingchannel.org] or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>

<h3>Surveys or Contests</h3>

<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes or surveys on the site which require you to disclose certain personally identifiable information in order to participate. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>

<h3>How We Disclose Information</h3>

<p>We are not in the business of selling your information to third parties. We do, however, disclose your personally identifiable information in a variety of circumstances in connection with developing and providing our Services and operating our business.  For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our Site enables users to communicate in a variety of ways. Any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area on any of our Sites, such as in a blog discussion, user review or other User Submission, will be publically available to others. This also applies to information you choose to make available through our features that connect to third party services, such as Twitter and Facebook. Teaching Channel may also syndicate content posted in public areas to other third party services.  Once you make your personally identifiable information publically available and accessible, that information may be collected and used by others without restriction. Similarly, information you make available to another user or users through private or semi-private communication channel may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on our Site.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel works with third party service providers to provide website hosting and maintenance as well as other services, such as sweepstakes administration. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to Teaching Channel, these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information.  Generally, these disclosures are made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information for the purpose for which it was provided. For example, Teaching Channel may provide your payment information (and supporting personal information) to a third party payment processor in connection with processing your payments for subscription fees.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel may also disclose your information if required to do so by law, where we believe that such action is necessary to comply with state or federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity.</p>

<p>Teaching Channel also reserves the right to disclose your information that we believe, in our sole discretion, is appropriate or useful to protect you, other users, third parties, or ourselves from harm or liability; to protect Teaching Channel and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government and law enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of our Services; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Teaching Channel, our users, or others.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, share a video or other aspect of the site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Teaching Channel stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<p>Your friend may contact us at privacy@teachingchannel.org to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h3>Import Contacts</h3>

<p>You can import contacts from your Outlook or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our site. We collect the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p><b>Our Sites contain links to websites</b> and services provided by third parties. Any personally identifiable information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's policies, if any, governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties' privacy and security policies before providing them with personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Teaching Channel does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. <b>IF YOU ARE NOT 13 YEARS-OF-AGE OR OLDER YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE SITE OR SUBMIT PERSONAL INFORMATION TO TEACHING CHANNEL.</b> If Teaching Channel learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected through our Service, then Teaching Channel will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has posted, submitted or otherwise communicated personal information to our Service without your consent, then you may alert Teaching Channel at <a href="mailto:privacy@teachingchannel.org">privacy@teachingchannel.org</a> so that we may take appropriate action to remove the child's personally identifiable information from our systems.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>

<p>Teaching Channel uses certain industry standard managerial and technical safeguards to increase the integrity and security of personally identifiable information stored on our systems. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to Teaching Channel, nor can we guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach, circumvention, failure, or interruption of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If Teaching Channel learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through our Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@teachingchannel.org">privacy@teachingchannel.org</a>.</p>

<h3>International Visitors</h3>

<p>Our Sites are intended solely for visitors located within the United States. If you nonetheless choose to use our Site from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing and by providing your personally identifiable information on the Site you consent to that transfer, storage, and processing. Further, we may transfer this data from the United States to other jurisdictions in connection with storing and processing data, fulfilling your requests, and operating our Sites.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>

<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account  or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at privacy@teachingchannel.org. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h3>In the Event of Merger or Sale</h3>

<p>In the event that all or a portion of Teaching Channel or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>

<h3>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion, as provided in the Teaching Channel Terms and Conditions. If we modify the Privacy Policy, we will make it available through our Sites, and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access our Sites for the first time after such material changes are made. Our amended Privacy Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through our Sites, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account ceasing use of our Sites.  Your continued use of our Sites after revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Your Choices</h3>

<p>You may, of course, decline to share certain personally identifiable information with Teaching Channel, in which case Teaching Channel may not be able to provide to you some or all of the features and functionality found on our Sites. Please understand that Teaching Channel may retain all information you have submitted for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics and the use and disclosure purposes described herein.</p>
