TeamUnify hosts the TeamUnify Website and Swim Team Websites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. TeamUnify also offers enhanced security features that permit Customers to configure security settings to their level of comfort.</p>
                            <p>Here are additional security measures we take:</p>
                            <p><strong>Physical Security</strong>
                                <br> Our production equipment is collocated at a facility that provides 24-hour physical security, redundant electrical generators, and other backup equipment designed to keep servers continually up and running. </p>
                            <p><strong>Data Encryption</strong>
                                <br>TeamUnify leverages encryption products to protect customer data and communications, including 256-bit Thawte SSL Certification. The lock icon in the browser indicates that data is shielded from access while in transit.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Customer Authentication</strong>
                                <br>Customers access the TeamUnify Website and/or Swim Team Websites only with a valid and unique user name and password combination, which is encrypted via SSL while in transmission. Once authenticated, your connection to http://www.teamunify.com or http://www.mainset.com is encrypted using a modern cipher suite utilizing TLS 1.2. Customers are prevented from choosing weak or obvious passwords. Customers must enter their user name and password for each log in.
                                <br>
                                <br>TeamUnify issues a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include either the username or password of the Customer. TeamUnify does not use session cookies to store other Personal Information or session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Operating System Security </strong>
                                <br>TeamUnify provides operating system-level security by using a minimal number of access points to all production servers. We protect all operating system accounts with strong passwords, and production servers do not share a master password database. All operating systems are maintained at each vendor's recommended patch levels for security and are hardened by disabling and/or removing any unnecessary users, protocols, and processes. </p>
                            <p><strong>Database Security </strong>
                                <br>Whenever possible, database access is controlled at the operating system and database connection level for additional security. Access to production databases is limited to a number of points, and production databases do not share a master password database. </p>
                            <p><strong>Server Management Security </strong>
                                <br>TeamUnify employees do not have direct access to the TeamUnify production equipment, except where necessary for system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups. The TeamUnify engineering team provides all system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <strong>PCI-DSS Compliance</strong>
                                <br>TeamUnify is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS") as a Level 1 service provider. PCI-DSS is the bankcard industry's most stringent security standard. TeamUnify will maintain all applicable PCI DSS requirements to the extent that TeamUnify handles, has access to, or otherwise stores, processes, or transmits customer cardholder data or sensitive authentication data, or manages the customer's cardholder data environment on behalf of a customer. Examples of TeamUnify's security measures include: physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards; sophisticated security monitoring tools; documented security policies; use of strong encryption for transmissions of Order Information to and from TeamUnify Customers; restricting access to personally identifiable information; and, periodic security audits by third party security experts.
                                <br>
                                <br>Special notice regarding the security of TeamUnify's OnDeck and MainSet software applications:
                                <br>
                                <br>Data downloaded into either the MainSet and/or OnDeck applications is not secure and is at risk for potential inadvertent use by a non-authorized person that takes possession of the device on which one or both of the applications has been installed. Both OnDeck and MainSet application requires that a User Login be entered every time a Customer wants to use the application to help improve protection of the data that is stored within the OnDeck and/or MainSet application database that resides on the device. However, a Customer may set a preference once signed in that will remember the password by automatically populating the password field. Setting this preference is not recommended and will make the device less secure. Customers will be warned of this again when they go to set the user preference. Customers are solely responsible for protecting the security of their devices and the downloaded data on their device. TeamUnify is not responsible or liable for the loss of a device and the stored data and/or inadvertent use by another party.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, no data storage system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers or any Personal Information provided to us in connection with your use of the TeamUnify Website or any Swim Team Website.</p>
                            <h3>Security Researchers:  TeamUnify Vulnerability Reporting Policy</h3>
