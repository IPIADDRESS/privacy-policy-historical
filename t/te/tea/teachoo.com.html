        <p class="lead"><b>How We Protect Your Information</b></p>

        <p>The security of your information is important to us. Teachoo has implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser when finished using the Teachoo Platform on a shared or unsecured device.</p>

        <p class="lead"><b>Access and Amend Your Information</b></p>
        <p>You may update or correct your account information at any time by logging in to your account. You may also make a number of other adjustments to settings or the display of information about you as described in more detail in the following section about Your Choices.</p>

        <p class="lead"><b>Your Choices</b></p>
        <p>You may, of course, decline to submit information through the Teachoo Platform, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may also control the types of notifications and communications we send, limit the information shared within the Teachoo Platform about you, and otherwise amend certain privacy settings. Here is some further information about some of your choices:</p>

        <p><b><i>Your Content. </i></b>You may edit or delete the answers that you post at any time. Any questions you have posted may remain on the Teachoo Platform and be edited by other users. Any deleted content will be removed from third party sites from which it has been shared via Teachoo’s standard sharing features; however we have no control over deletions or changes to Your Content if it has been shared manually by others. When you make edits to Your Content, other users will be able to see the history of those edits in your profile activity and on content edit logs.</p>

        <!-- <p><b><i>Adult Content.</i></b> In your profile’s privacy settings, you can elect whether to receive adult content.</p> -->
        <p><b><i>Emails, Text Messages and Communications</i></b>. When you join the Teachoo Platform by signing up for an account or creating a profile, as part of the service, you will receive the Teachoo digest containing content that we believe may match your interests. As permitted by law, you are also opting to receive other emails and text messages from us that may be of interest to you as a user of the Teachoo Platform. You can manage your email, text messages and notice preferences in your account profile settings, under your Emails and Notifications settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative or legal notices from us. If you opt-out of receiving emails and text messages about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you transactional e-mails and text messages about your account or any services you have requested or received from us.</p>

        <p>Third parties may comment on your postings within the Teachoo Platform. In your profile, under your Privacy Settings, you can adjust whether to allow people to comment on your answers and posts. You can also adjust permissions about who you allow to send you messages on the Teachoo Platform.</p>

        <p><b><i>Followers. </i></b>You can block the ability of another Teachoo user to follow you by selecting the setting for this in the other user’s profile. You can change whether or not you follow other users.</p>

        <p><b><i>Topics</i></b>. You can change topics that you follow or that your profile lists as areas that you know about.</p>

        <p><b><i>Credentials</i></b>. You can change your credentials that are displayed in your profile or in connection with a specific answer.</p>

        <p><b><i>Indexed Search</i></b><i>.</i> In your privacy settings, you can control whether your profile and name is indexed by search engines. Changes to privacy settings may only apply on a going-forward basis; for example, your name (e.g., answers and profile) that has already been indexed by search engines may remain indexed for a period of time even after you have turned off indexing, as implementing this change is outside of our control.</p>

        <p><b><i>Deleted or Deactivated Account</i></b>. If you choose Delete Your Account in your privacy settings, then all of Your Content will be removed from public visibility on the Teachoo Platform, and it may not be restored by us, even if you change your mind. If you choose Deactivate Your Account, then you will no longer receive any communications from us, and users will not be able to interact with you; however Your Content will remain on the Teachoo Platform. Once you deactivate your account, you can reactivate it any time by choosing to log in.</p>
        <p><b><i>Pixels.</i></b> This setting is tied to your cookies, and, unless you are logged in to the Teachoo Platform, will only be effective on the browser for which you have performed the opt-out.</p>
        <p><b><i>Third Party Ad Networks</i></b></p>
