<h2>Privacy</h2>
<div id="body_content">
<p><strong>Scope</strong><br>This statement applies to all websites operated by or on behalf of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS). </p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong><br>Registration can be made to the LLS Web sites through barkers on the sites, and through the registration page available on the main LLS site (<a href="http://www.lls.org/">www.lls.org</a>). It is not necessary to register or submit any personal information in order to use&nbsp;any LLS web site. All sections of&nbsp;LLS&nbsp;web sites are available and fully functional for users who do not chose to register, or who register but do not log into LLS&nbsp;sites when visiting them. The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society does, however, provide a range of&nbsp;web site personalization options, for which a user must first register including personal fundraising pages for selected events through a 3<sup>rd</sup> party vendor. </p>
<p>Any and all user information provided to LLS web sites through our personalization/registration tools can be viewed, edited, or deleted by that user at any time. </p>
<p><strong>Information Use</strong><br>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society collects information from users through several points on the web,&nbsp;such as registration to the site, making a donation, ordering free&nbsp;materials,&nbsp;signing up for the lls.org discussion boards&nbsp;and online event fundraising. The primary reason for LLS&nbsp;to collect personal users' information is to provide&nbsp;personalization options for our web visitors, and to facilitate web site features that require user input, whether this information is submitted directly by the site user, or collected by use of technologies such as cookies, as discussed below. </p>
<p>Personal financial information in the form of a credit card number and expiration date are only collected if a site user wishes to make an online donation through LLS online. This information is not maintained by LLS when entered online. All online transactions are securely transmitted using SSL encryption. </p>
<p>User information submitted through LLS web sites&nbsp;is only used for the purposes for which it was collected. </p>
<p><span class="generaltext2"><font size="2"><strong>Advertising Policy</strong><br>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society (LLS) does not host any form of advertising from our web sites or email communications.</font></span></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about that user. LLS uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. </p>
<p>The primary function of cookies for LLS&nbsp;is to facilitate use of our web sites by our users, and to enrich your online experience with us. </p>
<p>Persistent cookies are used to store the user's registration identification&nbsp;information from their basic registration, to facilitate their logging in to their personalized view of LLS web sites. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our sites. See the Profile section. </p>
<p>Session cookies remember what chapter you are registered into or visiting online and who you are if you go from one LLS web site to another in a session. This way we are able to cut down on the number of logins required when you visit various LLS web sites during any given session. </p>
<p>If users reject cookies, they may still use our sites, and all the informational resources provided through them. Their registration-based personalization options and the capacity of their browser to keep track of what chapter they are visiting online as they go from one of our sites to another, is lost if the user rejects cookies. </p>
<p>LLS&nbsp;uses a tracking utility provided by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party vendor to track usage of specific web pages and other resources provided through our web site. The vendor sets cookies as a method for compiling site usage information but these cookies are only used to compile demographic models of site usage and are not tied to the user's personal information. </p>
<p><strong>Referral Service</strong><br>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society provides options for site visitors to send messages to friends including the option to send ePostcards, individual pages,&nbsp;eNewsletters and eAdvocacy Alerts or to&nbsp;notify a friend of a donation. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. LLS&nbsp;stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society at admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org to request the removal of this information from our database. Data obtained through the "Notify a Friend of a Donation" feature is only used for notification purposes. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Communications from the Site</strong> </p>
<p><strong>New Registration Emails</strong><br>All newly registered users may automatically sent a welcoming email containing useful information orienting the user to LLS web site services. This email may also include the email address login and the password that the user registered with, as a reminder to help the user access their new registration and their personalized view of LLS&nbsp;web sites. In some cases, the email is sent from a partner site that is providing additional services such as personal online fundraising pages. </p>
<p><strong>Newsletter</strong><br>If a user wishes to opt-in subscribe to our e-newsletter, we ask for contact information required for basic registration to the site, consisting of a working email address, a zip code and a password. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Sharing</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>Though The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. </p>
<p>LLS may need to share personal information with third parties in other limited circumstances. For example, we may release personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: advising you of our upcoming events, products, partnership offers, volunteer opportunities, and health-related information or processing credit card payments. LLS may also make your name and postal address available to other nonprofit organizations whose services or activities may be of interest to you. However, third parties retained by LLS to provide such services are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and are not authorized to use this information for any purpose other than providing those services. If you would like to opt out of having The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society share your name and postal address with third party organizations, please email <a href="mailto:admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org?subject=Do%20Not%20Share">admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org</a> and type 'do not share' in the subject line of your email. </p>
<p><strong>Third Party Intermediaries</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>LLS uses various 3<sup>rd</sup> party transaction services to process online donations. </li>
<li>LLS provides the option of receiving certain of its online booklets, brochures, and fact sheets by mail through request forms on our Web sites. These materials are shipped by the US Postal Service. </li>
<li>Additional services for Light The Night Incentives, ordering from the LLS e-store also utilize 3<sup>rd</sup> party vendors for ordering, fulfillment and customer service. </li></ul>
<p>We will only provide these companies the information they need to deliver the service and prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose. These companies/organizations do not share or use personally identifiable information that may be obtained from these transactions for any secondary purposes. </p>
<p><strong>Links</strong><br>LLS web sites provide select links to other sites. Determination of which outside links to include on the LLS Web sites is made by healthcare and clinical research professionals, to ensure that only links to sites that meet our standards for accuracy and reliability are included. Please be aware, however, that LLS is not responsible for the policies or privacy practices of Web sites maintained by other organizations. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites, and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information that they might visit. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by LLS web sites. </p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>If The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society changes its privacy policy, changes to this privacy statement will be posted, with prominent links to the new policy positioned on the LLS homepage (<a href="http://www.lls.org/">http://www.lls.org</a>), and other places we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp;The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</strong><br>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.&nbsp;For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our web site from those we actually know are under the age of 13.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA, see: <a href="http://www.coppa.org/">www.coppa.org</a>) protects the personal information of children under the age of 13. This applies to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information?for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms?when they are tied to individually identifiable information. It is important for you to understand this law; we encourage you to read more about COPPA. </p>
<p><strong>Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy</strong><br>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society is committed to providing a safe, secure, and fun online experience for children who visit our network of sites. We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected online and to helping parents and children have positive experiences on the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. A parent or guardian may revoke their consent and ask that information about their child be deleted from the site by contacting our offices via mail (see: address below) or email (<a href="mailto:admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org">admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org</a>). To do this or to review personal information collected from children, we must verify the identity of the requesting parent. When a parent or guardian revokes consent, we will stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child. To respect the privacy of parents, information collected and used for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notice is not maintained in retrievable form by the site if parental consent is not obtained after a reasonable time. </p>
<p><strong>Contacting Us</strong><br>Effective management of our email list to honor the interests of our contacts is a founding principle of our email communications program. Whether you would like to be removed from a specific campaign or eNewsletter offering, all of our communications include an 'unsubscribe' option. </p>
<p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact us by email at <a href="mailto:admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org">admin@leukemia-lymphoma.org</a> or by postal mail at: </p>
