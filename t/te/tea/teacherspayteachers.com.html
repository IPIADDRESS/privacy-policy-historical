		<p><font size="2"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></font></p><p><font size="2"><strong></strong><br>We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read this  Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable  information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know  what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the  circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments,  suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us  via email at privacy@TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com or in writing at: Privacy  Director, Teacher Synergy Inc., 419 Lafayette St., 4th Floor, New York, NY  10003, USA.<strong><br><br><br>Online Privacy Standards. </strong><br> While there are no official  standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles  supported by the Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices  Principles, currently available at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/tos">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/tos</a>.<strong><br><br><br>What This Policy Covers. </strong><br> This policy covers  TEACHERSpayTEACHERS’ treatment of personally identifiable information that we  obtain when you visit our website or use our services. We regard personally  identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or  contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email  address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to  identify you as a user in our system, such as your selected UserName, is not  considered personally identifiable information.<strong><br><br><br>What This Policy Does Not Cover. <br></strong>This policy does not cover the  privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as any  partners and advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services  and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites  operate independently of TEACHERSpayTEACHERS and they have their own privacy or  security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to  review their policies before submitting any personal information to them. </font></p><p><font size="2"><strong><br>1. HOW  WE COLLECT INFORMATION</strong><strong><br></strong></font></p><p><font size="2"><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information You Provide</strong><strong><br></strong></font></p><p><font size="2"><strong>Registration Information</strong>. <br>During the registration process,  we collect your email address. We will send you an email to verify that you are  the owner of this address. You will also choose a UserName that we will use to  identify you in our system. When you register for membership as a  Teacher-Author, we will also collect your name, address, and birth date. These  are mandatory items that we require when you register to be a Teacher-Author  with TEACHERSpayTEACHERS. This information helps to ensure we can properly pay  Teacher-Authors and ensures that the feedback loop is accurate. Also, since our  service is not intended for children (see our <a href="index.php?method=Content&amp;Page=TermsofService">Terms of Service</a> for further  information), birth date information  assists us in blocking access to children.<strong><br><br><br>Member Profile Information</strong>.<br>During the Registration process,  Teacher-Authors will have the opportunity to provide a public Member Profile  which is like a biography about you and the Teaching Content that you wish to  make available through TEACHERSpayTEACHERS. You can choose to provide as much  or as little information about yourself in your public Member Profile as you  see fit.<strong><br><br><br>Access To Your Personal  Information.<br></strong>In  general, we make it easy for you to view any personally identifiable  information we have collected from you in your Member Profile Page, where you  can add, edit, or remove information as you see fit. You can always access your  Member Profile Page by logging in to your “Manage My Account” pages at this link: <a href="http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com">http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com.</a><span class="Apple-style-span"><b><br><br><br>S</b><strong style="">ocial Security Numbers</strong>. <br>For Teacher-Authors who earn more than $600 in a calendar year, we will require the Teacher-Author to provide his or her social security number or tax identification number. We use the social security number or tax identification number for the sole purpose of filing a Form-1099 with the United States IRS for the Teacher-Author. Otherwise the Teacher-Author's social security number or tax identification number will be protected. Any Teacher-Author whose payments from TeachersPayTeachers cross the $600 threshold will be sent a notice requesting their social security number or tax identification number for this purpose. Until we receive this information from the Teacher-Author, we will be unable to send further payments to the Teacher-Author.<br><br></span></font></p><p><font size="2"><span class="Apple-style-span"></span><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information  We Do Not Collect </strong><strong>Children</strong>. <br>As explained further in our  <a href="index.php?method=Content&amp;Page=TermsofService">Terms of Service</a>, our website is intended for adults  only. You must be 18 years of age or older to register to use our website.  Therefore, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information  about children. If you believe that we have information from or about anyone  under 18 years of age, please notify us by email at  privacy@TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com or write to our Privacy Director at the address  noted above.&nbsp;<strong></strong> <br><br><br><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information  We Track</strong><strong><br></strong></font></p><p><font size="2"><strong>Log Files</strong>. <br>Like many websites, we gather  certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically and store it in web  server log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses,  browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating  system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to  improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements  around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a  whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of  services or users from which individual user identities have been removed, and  therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.<br><br><br><strong>Cookies</strong>. <br>A cookie is a small text file  that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. It can also  help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, and what pages they  view during their visit. Similar to many websites, we store an encrypted cookie  on your computer so we can remember you when you come back to our website  without requiring you to log-in every time. Cookies also allow us to track and  understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our  site.You can set your web browser software to disable cookies. To do so,  please refer to the help section of your specific browser for more information  on how to manage or disable cookies. If you disable cookies, you may still view  our site, but some areas of our site will not work properly.Some of our business partners, such as advertisers, may also use  cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies, and,  as noted above, this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our  business partners or advertisers.<strong><br><br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW  WE USE INFORMATION</strong><strong><br></strong></font></p><p><font size="2"><strong>Communication of Service-related  Announcements</strong>.<br> We  use emails and/or prominent notifications on our website as our primary means  to inform our users of service-related announcements from TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.  We may use your email address to deliver important service-related  announcements. Example service-related announcements include: email  verification during registration, requests for a password reset, important  security or server maintenance updates, software updates, upgrades, and new  releases, or policy changes. These service-related announcements are considered  a fundamental part of the Service provided by TEACHERSpayTEACHERS, and users  cannot opt-out of these email announcements.<strong><br><br><br>On Our Website. </strong><br>We may use information provided by  you on our website in the following ways: </font></p><ul type="square"><li><font size="2"><strong>Identification       Of Members By Name or UserName</strong>.<br>As explained further in our <a href="index.php?method=Content&amp;Page=TermsofService">Terms of Service</a>, Teacher-Authors may post their Teaching       Content for sale through the Service. Teacher-Buyers are also given an       opportunity to provide feedback about the Teaching Content they have       purchased and used. Thus, in providing this service, we depend in part on       the contributions and actions of our Members to improve the quality of the       experience that Members have with the Service. When you post information       to TEACHERSpayTEACHERS (such as posting Teaching Content, describing       Teaching Content, adding a comment or giving feedback about Teaching       Content you have purchased, asking or answering questions through the       “Teacher-Author Q/A” feature), you will       be identified by your UserName (if you are a Teacher-Buyer) and by your       real name (if you are a Teacher-Author) as the author of that post,       comment, or action.<br><br><br></font> </li><li><font size="2"><strong>In Your Public       Member Profile</strong>.<br>Teacher-Authors are required to provide their real names which will be       visible to all users. You will have the option to include other personally       identifiable information in your public Member Profile, but you are not       required to do so. Your Member Profile, in addition to your real name,       must, however, at minimum include the following information: state or       province where you reside and the grade level and subject area you teach       or have taught. You can easily add, edit, and delete information in your       public Member Profile through the Member Profile Page which is available by       logging in to your “Manage My Stuff” pages at this link: <a href="http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com">http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com</a>.<br><br><br></font></li><li><font size="2"><strong>For Site Statistics</strong>.<br>As noted above, we use       information collected from our web log files to calculate and publish       anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our users       are interested in viewing. For example, we track and publish the total       number of users who have viewed a particular web page. We publish this       data in aggregate form only, and do not tie it to any personally       identifiable information.<br><br></font></li></ul><font size="2"><strong>For Internal Reporting and  Internal Analysis. </strong><br>As  noted above, we use information gathered from log files and cookies to improve  our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around  the site, and to gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole.  We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.<strong><br><br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW  WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</strong> <strong><br><br>On Our Website. <br></strong>We may chose to provide a group  blog or message board in the future. These features would allow you to  communicate with other Members by posting public messages. Please be aware that  what you write in these public messages can be viewed, collected or used by  anyone who visits our website. We are not responsible for any personally  identifiable information that you submit or permit others to submit through  public messages.In addition, as explained above, information in your public Member  Profile is made available to other Members of the Service.<strong><br><br><br>Sharing, Renting, and Selling  Information We Collect With Third-Parties.</strong><br>We will neither rent nor sell your personally identifiable information  to anyone. Occasionally we share anonymous, non-personal, aggregate information  about our user base with partners or advertisers, and, as mentioned above, we  may publish these aggregate usage statistics on our website for the interest of  our users. We do not tie this shared or published data to personally  identifiable information.<br><br><br><strong>As Necessary In Legal  Circumstances</strong>.<br>We  reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as  required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our  rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal  process served on our website.<strong><br><br><br>As Necessary In An Acquisition</strong>.<br>If our company is acquired, all  of our assets, including Member information, may be transferred to the  acquiring company. At that time, your Member information may become subject to  the acquiring company's privacy policy. Before we transfer your Member  information, we will notify you either by email or by posting a prominent  notice on our site, and we will remind you of your ability to add, edit or  delete your personally identifiable information from your Member Profile Page in  advance of any such transfer.<strong><br><br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW  WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE</strong><strong><br><br>Security of Member Profile</strong>.<br>Your Member Profile information  is password-protected. We will not share your password with anyone.

Please be aware that no method of  transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%  secure, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your  personal information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<strong><br><br><br>Management Procedures</strong>.<br>We also maintain standard  physical and electronic procedural safeguards that limit access to your  personally identifiable information to our employees (or people working on our  behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of  standard business activities, need to access your personally identifiable  information.<strong><br><br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YOUR  PERSONAL CHOICES<br><br></strong><strong>Information Shared With Other  Members</strong>.<br>You will  be able to control what personal information about you is shared with other  Members in your public Member Profile, and what information you choose to keep  private. You can view, add, edit, and delete information in your public Member  Profile by logging in to your “Manage My Account” pages at this link: <a href="http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com">http://www.TEACHERSpayTEACHERS.com</a><strong><br><br><br>Editing and Deleting Member  Profile Information</strong>.<br>You can view the personally identifiable information we have collected from you  in your Member Profile Page where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see  fit.
