		</p><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
		<h4>Acceptance</h4>
		<p>TenMarks Education, Inc. (TenMarks) feels strongly about
			protecting your privacy and the privacy of a student. TenMarks WILL
			NOT sell, trade, or assign any unaggregated, personally-identifiable
			personal information that it collects to third parties outside of
			TenMarks. If you have any questions, concerns or comments regarding
			this privacy policy, you may contact us at the email and address
			posted at the end of this policy statement. We are committed to
			addressing your privacy or security questions or concerns.</p>
		<br> 
		<h4>1. Information Collected by TenMarks</h4>
		<p>In order for you to participate in the TenMarks Beta Program,
			the TenMarks Free Trial Program, and/or other TenMarks products (the
			"Programs"), you must register on TenMarks. This registration process
			will require you to provide your name, email addresses, phone number,
			school and grade level information of the students you're
			registering, and, if payment will be required for the Programs, your
			credit card information, including billing address. We call this
			information "Registration Information."</p>
		<hr>
		<br> 
		<p>
		</p><h4>2. How TenMarks will use the information collected from you</h4>
		<p>Mailing Address: Your mailing address may be used to allow
			TenMarks to mail you various Program materials and payment receipts.
		
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>Email Address</strong>: Email addresses will serve
			as your username on TenMarks. The email addresses may be used to send
			a confirmation email at registration, as well as information and
			updates to the Programs. We will also email reports, with further
			information about the progress students are making on the Programs.
			We may use the email addresses as an additional means of
			communicating with you and your students about the Programs and
			TenMarks, including notifying you of updates to the Web Site or its
			related policies. Credit Card Information: With your consent, we may
			use and save your credit card information to bill you for the
			Programs.
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>Phone Number</strong>: Your phone number will serve
			as an alternate way of contacting you for the same purposes as the
			email address.
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>StudentName</strong>: A student's name will be used
			to generate their username, passwords, and customize a student's
			participation in the Programs, as well as to personalize the reports
			and updates about the student's progress in the Programs.
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>Relationship to Student</strong>: A
			parent/teacher's relationship to the student will be used for profile
			and tracking purposes and to personalize the student's reports.
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>Student's School Grade Level</strong>: We will use
			a student grade level to group Performance Data of students of
			similar grade levels so we can assess performance by grade level, and
			improve the program.
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>Secondary Uses</strong>: Registration Information
			and other information may be used by us for demographic profiling,
			statistical analysis, and targeted advertising, although in such
			cases, the information will be aggregated as ANONYMOUS statistical
			information.
		</p><p>
			<br> <strong>Participation History</strong>: The details of any
			order you place and the Programs you or a student choose will be
			collected for customer service, marketing and business purposes.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>3. Information TenMarks collects directly from a student</h4>
		<p>TenMarks collects information directly from a student, over the
			Internet, in the form of the interactions that a student makes when
			participating in the Programs. We refer to the data resulting from
			such participation, which includes but is not limited to data on when
			a student starts and stops a lesson, the responses a student makes to
			questions asked, the timing of a student's student, a student's
			choice of character and customizations, and the choice of lessons to
			play as "Performance Data." We will use Performance Data to (1)
			measure a student's performance in each lesson of the TenMarks
			Programs and to adapt the Programs to his or her education needs, (2)
			analyze a student's Performance Data, and provide the student and the
			associated parent/educator with periodic progress reports about a
			student's performance in the Programs, and (3) improve the Programs.
			If we ever need to collect information that is not Performance Data
			directly from a student, TenMarks will seek your authorization prior
			to collecting such additional information from a student. In
			addition, we may aggregate a student's Performance Data with the
			Performance Data of other students participating in the Programs for
			marketing and other business related purposes. Aggregate information
			will be ANONYMOUS and will not identify a student.</p>
		<hr>
		<br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>4. Opting-out of providing the information we request</h4>
		<p>Because the TenMarks Programs are individualized and customized
			for each student, all the information we request from you and
			students are required for you and a student to participate in the
			Programs, with the exception of certain information to be used for
			our marketing purposes to you only. At any time, you may revoke your
			consent to allowing a student to participate in the TenMarks Programs
			or refuse to allow TenMarks to further use or collect a student's
			personal information. Any ANONYMOUS performance data will be
			retained, but we will no longer use any identifiable information
			regarding you or a student that you have provided. However, if you do
			any of the foregoing, you and a student will not be able to
			participate in the Programs.</p>
		<p>
		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>5. Reviewing and changing your informationt</h4>
		<p>You may review and modify your Registration Information at any
			time by accessing our website using your password, and sending us a
			support mail with a request to change it.</p>
		<p>
		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>6. Consent</h4>
		<p>In order to use the Programs, you and/or your student(s)are
			asked to submit certain personal information about yourselves and to
			authorize TenMarks to use that information in a limited number of
			ways. We ask you and/or the student to ensure that the
			Parent/Educator has reviewed and submitted a Consent as part of the
			registration process, which will require you to consent to our
			collection and use of information directly from a student over the
			Internet as described above.</p>
		<p>
		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>7. Password Protection</h4>
		<p>You and your students will be assigned a password each to
			access the Programs through our website, and this password will be
			used to allow you and the students to use the Programs. The passwords
			should be kept confidential. Your password will also allow you to
			review and change the information we collect about you and students.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>8. Protecting your information</h4>
		<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
			100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
			of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
			TenMarks has multiple security measures in place to protect the loss,
			misuse or alteration of information under our control. Please note
			that this Program is hosted in North America. If you are visiting
			from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data
			collection and use that may differ from U.S./Canadian laws, please
			note that you are transferring your personal data to the United
			States/Canada, which does not have the same data protection laws as
			the EU or other regions and by providing your personal data you
			consent to the use of your personal data for the uses identified
			above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and the transfer of
			your personal data to the United States/Canada as indicated above.</p>
		<p>
		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>9. Your information and third parties</h4>
		<p>Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, TenMarks WILL NOT
			disclose the information that it obtains from you to third parties
			without your express written permission, or where we believe, in good
			faith, that the law requires us to disclose the information. TenMarks
			WILL NOT sell, trade, or assign any unaggregated personal information
			that it collects to third parties outside of TenMarks. We, however,
			may aggregate the information that we collect from users of our
			website to create demographic profiles and performance profiles
			regarding the progress of students who use the Programs. TenMarks may
			share aggregated information with marketing professionals, or
			potential investors. This aggregated information will be compiled and
			reported in the form of ANONYMOUS group statistics only.
			Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, as TenMarks continues to
			develop its business, it might sell some or all of its assets. In
			such transactions, customer information is generally one of the
			transferred business assets. An acquiring company would be required
			to protect all information that TenMarks collects from users of our
			website and Programs in accordance with the terms of this Privacy
			Policy.</p>

		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>10. Unsolicited third-party promotional emails</h4>
		<p>TenMarks will not send you unsolicited third-party promotional
			emails.</p>
		<p>
		</p><div class="horizontal-line"></div>
		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>11. Use of cookies</h4>
		<p>As a standard practice, TenMarks uses "cookies". A cookie is a
			small amount of data sent to your browser from our web server and
			stored on your computer, then sent back to the server by your browser
			each time you access our website. Cookies enable us to track usage of
			our website. In addition, cookies are required for the operation of
			the Programs. Please note that if you refuse the TenMarks cookie (by
			turning cookies off in your browser or by clicking "don't accept" if
			you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies), our
			Programs will not work. Cookies cannot be used to gather personal
			information from your computer.</p>

		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>12. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
		<p>
			Congress has enacted a law called the Children's Online Privacy
			Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) which is designed to protect
			children's privacy during use of the Internet. TenMarks has
			implemented practices consistent with the guidelines provided by the
			Federal Trade Commission to date. TenMarks will never knowingly
			request personally identifiable information or private content from
			anyone under the age of 13 without parental or educator consent.
			TENMARKS DOES NOT SHARE CHILDRENS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
			WITH THIRD PARTIES. If you are a parent, legal guardian, or educator
			of a user under 13 you may, at any time, revoke your consent to allow
			a student to use the Programs under your subscription, refuse to
			allow TenMarks to further use or collect a student's personal
			information, or direct TenMarks to delete all identifiable
			information regarding a student that you have provided. To do so,
			please contact our Privacy Officer at the contact information below.
			However, if you do any of the foregoing, a student will not be able
			to use the Programs. If you would like more information about COPPA,
			please go to <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.html">http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.html</a>.

		<p></p>
		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>13. The Children's Internet Protection Act</h4>
		<p>
			The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law
			enacted by Congress in December 2000 to address concerns about access
			to offensive content over the Internet on school and library
			computers. CIPA imposes certain types of requirements on any school
			or library that receives funding support for Internet access or
			internal connections from the "E-rate" program - a program that makes
			certain technology more affordable for eligible schools and
			libraries. Our Programs do not provide links to external resources or
			chat rooms, and do not contain any offensive or inappropriate matter.
			As a result, any school or library that uses TenMarks Programs will
			be fully compliant with CIPA. If you would like more information
			about CIPA, please go to <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html">http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html</a>.

		<br> <br>
		<p>
		</p><h4>14. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</h4>
		<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a
			Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.
			The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable
			program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents
			certain rights with respect to their children's education records.
			These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age
			of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. TenMarks is
			fully compliant with FERPA. Specifically:
		</p><p>
			<br> 1) Any sensitive online information is transmitted over
			secure channels.
		</p><p>
			<br> 2) All student data are stored in ways that are not
			publicly accessible.
		</p><p>
			<br> 3) Security audits are regularly performed to ensure data
			integrity.
		</p><p>
			<br> TenMarks does not share student information with any third
			parties. If a school requests that student data should be sent to a
			third party, with parental consent, TenMarks would send the data to
			the school and never directly to the third party. If you would like
			more information about FERPA, please go to <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>.

		</p><h4>15. Amendments</h4>
		<p>TenMarks may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We
			may notify you by email regarding any material changes to our privacy
			and security practices. Please review all revisions to the Privacy
			Policy. Your continued use of our website(s) and the Programs after
			the date TenMarks has updates such policies will be deemed to be your
			agreement to the changed terms.</p>
