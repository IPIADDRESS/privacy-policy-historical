<h1>Privacy policy<br></h1>



<p>The privacy of visitors to the teneric.co.uk web site is very important to us.

</p><p>At teneric.co.uk, we recognise that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit teneric.co.uk web property, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.
</p>



<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p>We do use browser cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

</p><p>We may also use third party advertisements on teneric.co.uk to support our sites. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
</p>

<h2>DoubleClick DART Cookies</h2>
<p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting").

</p><p>The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx.

</p><p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

</p><p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
</p>



<h2>Teneric Emails</h2>

<p>If you received a mailing from us, (a) your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us.  We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our mailings.

</p><p><b>How we protect your privacy  </b>
</p><p>We use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. 

</p><p><b>Sharing and Usage</b>

</p><p>We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law.  Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.  

</p><p><b>How can you stop receiving email from us?</b>

</p><p>Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us, or to change your expressed interests. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email.

</p><p>If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to <a href="mailto:abuse@teneric.co.uk">abuse@teneric.co.uk</a> for review.
