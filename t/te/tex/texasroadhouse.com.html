Texas Roadhouse only collects Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to or share with us. The Personal Information that we collect through our Website depends on the nature of your activities, including, but not limited to whether you send information to the Guest Comments page, join the Willie Nelson Fan Club, purchase merchandise, submit a personal story, etc. Personal Information that Texas Roadhouse may collect from you when you contact us, sign up to become a Texas Roadie, order merchandise from us, e-mail or submit a post to us, or become a fan club member, may include your name, address, phone number (daytime, home, and/or cell), fax number, billing address, e-mail address, age, gender, photograph, credit/debit card information (including credit card name, type, number, expiration date), purchase information, and other information that you voluntarily provide.<br> <br>
    In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), it is necessary for Texas Roadhouse to obtain parental permission for all children under the age of 13 to provide personal information through our Website. Persons under the age of thirteen (13) are not authorized to make purchases from our Website, and we do not collect unauthorized information about children. Texas Roadhouse is concerned about the safety of children and their use of the Internet, and therefore, in accordance with COPPA, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. In the event that Texas Roadhouse receives actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical. </p> </li> <li> <h3>How We Use the Personal Information We Collect</h3> <p>Texas Roadhouse uses your Personal Information to complete your merchandise orders and respond to your inquires, for marketing purposes (when you sign up to become a Texas Roadie), to identify your story as authentic when you submit a guest story or photograph, to enroll you for membership in the Willie Nelson Fan Club and identify you as the source of your posts, to help identify you in the event you lose your password, and to otherwise maximize your access to our online services and products. If you choose not to give us your personal information, you can still use most of our Website; however, you may not be able to send us e-mail inquiries, post on a fan club, sign up to become a Texas Roadie, or order merchandise. In the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of Texas Roadhouse's assets to a third party, we reserve the right to transfer your Personal Information to the third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br> <br>
    Texas Roadhouse may also disclose Personal Information: (1) to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant or other legal process; (2) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities; (3) to protect and defend Texas Roadhouse, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute; (4) to enforce the terms of use of our Website; and (5) to prevent imminent physical harm. <br> <br>
    Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Texas Roadhouse will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any Personal Information obtained through our Website or from third parties without your consent.<br> <br>
