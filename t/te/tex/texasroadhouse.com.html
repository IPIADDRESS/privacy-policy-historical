Persons under the age of thirteen (13) are not authorized to make purchases from our Website and we do not collect unauthorized information about children. Texas Roadhouse is concerned about the safety of children and their use of the Internet, and therefore, in accordance with COPPA, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
