<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last modified: April 20, 2012</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>1. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all products, software, services and
    websites of Enflick, Inc. (“Enflick”, “Our”, “We” or “Us”) (collectively,
    the “Services”). Enflick has designed this Privacy Policy to explain Our practices for
    collecting, using, disclosing and handling of your (“You” or “Your”) personal
    information in connection with Your access to, and use of, the Services. Personal
    information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, means information that can be used
    to personally identify You or is associated with any such information, but does not
    include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an
    organization</p>

<p>2. We have strict policies and procedures to protect Your information from being
    disclosed to unauthorized parties. We safeguard Your information in accordance with
    industry standard procedures and security standards and We maintain physical, electronic
    and procedural safeguards to protect Your personal information. Additionally, We
    continually assess new technologies to ensure that We are taking reasonable steps to
    protect Our records.</p>

<p>3. The Services are not intended for use by anyone who is not able to enter into a
    legally binding contract. If You are not able to legally form binding contracts, You may
    not use any of the Services or submit information about yourself to Us. If You have
    objections to this Privacy Policy, You should not access, sign up for, or use any of the
    Services.</p>

<p>4. We hope that the information below provides You with a better understanding of Our
    strict privacy protection policies. Please note that Enflick reserves the right to
    modify these policies at any time. We invite You to periodically consult this section
    for possible updates and changes.</p>

<h2>Accountability Towards Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>5. We are responsible for the personal information under Our control, including, but not
    limited to, information that has been transferred to a third party for processing (if
    applicable).</p>

<p>6. We have designated a Privacy Officer who is responsible for Our compliance with this
    policy and with privacy legislation. If You wish to contact Our Privacy Officer, You may
    contact them through one of the following means:</p>

<p>Post: Enflick, Inc.<br>
    375 Hagey Blvd, Suite 310<br>
    Waterloo, ON<br>
    N2L 3X2<br>
    Canada<br>
    Email: legal@enflick.com</p>

<h2>What Information do We Collect?</h2>

<p>7. We may collect the following types of information:<br>
    (a) Registration Information: When You sign up for a user account for any of the
    Services, We collect personal information, such as Your name, and email address and
    telephone number.<br>
    (b) IP Information: In general, We collect and use anonymous information and data
    regarding Your access and use of the Services. When You visit the Services via a
    browser, Our servers record the information that Your browser automatically sends
    whenever visiting or using any of Our websites (“Websites”), including Your web request,
    the Internet Protocol address and browser configuration of Your computer, the date and
    time of Your request, the uniform resource locator of the referring and/or exiting
    websites.<br>
    (c) Cookies and Analytical Tracking: Sometimes We use cookie technology, web beacons and
    other similar devices on Our Websites to enhance functionality and navigation for our
    visitors and portions of Our Websites may use statistical tools that may be operated by
    third party providers (collectively, the “Analytical Tools”). Information tracked
    through these mechanisms includes, but is not limited to: (i) your IP address; (ii) the
    type of web browser and operating system being used; (iii) the pages of a Website a user
    visits; and (iv) other websites a user visited before visiting one of the Websites. If
    you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable
    cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some
    customized features on the Websites. Cookies do not collect or contain your personal
    information.<br>
    Internet tags, graphic tags and similar web beacon type functions allow Us to count the
    number of users who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. We
    may use web beacons on the Websites to count users and to recognize users by accessing
    our cookies. Being able to access our cookies allows Us to personalize the Websites and
    improve your experience at the Websites. We may also include web beacons in
    HTML-formatted e-mail messages that We send to determine which e-mail messages were
    opened. Like cookies, web beacons do not collect or contain your personal
    information.<br>
    In the case of Analytical Tools, the information generated by the cookies and/or web
    beacons about your use of the Websites (including your IP address) will be transmitted
    to and stored on servers located outside of Canada including, but not limited to, the
    United States, by the applicable third party provider of an Analytical Tool. This
    information will be used for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Websites,
    compiling reports on Websites activity and providing other services relating to Websites
    activity and Internet usage. The third party providers of Analytical Tools may also
    transfer this information to other third parties where they are required to do so by
    law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf.<br>
    By using a Website, you consent to the processing of data about you by third party
    providers of Analytical Tools in the manner and for the purposes set out above.<br>
    (d) Information that You Provide: We may occasionally request from You or You may
    otherwise voluntarily provide Us with information that personally identifies You
    (including, but not limited to, downloads, product or service purchases, user support,
    contests, feedback, surveys and forums). We may receive personal information about You
    from a broad range of activities through the Services, including, but not limited to,
    Your inputs to the Services and general correspondence with Us. Depending on the service
    used, the personal information We collect may include contact information and
    demographic information, such as email address, phone number, display name and
    information about Your Device, as defined below, including, but not limited to, its
    unique identifier number.<br>
    (e) User communications: When You send email or other communications to US, We may

    and improve the Services. Some of the Services may be used to send messages and/or other
    content between other users of the Services or to third parties. If You send a message
    and/or other content to another user of the Services, We will retain that message and/or
    other content on Your behalf and will disclose that message and/or content to such user.
    When You send and receive SMS, MMS or other messages to or from one of Our services that
    provides SMS, and/or MMS functionality, We may collect and maintain information
    associated with those messages, such as the phone number, the wireless carrier
    associated with the phone number, the content of the message, and the date and time of
    the transaction.<br>
    (f) Third Party Applications: We may make third party applications, such as extensions,
    available through the Services. The information collected by Us when You enable a third
    party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the
    third party application provider is governed by their privacy policies.<br>
    When We request personal information from You, We will inform You of the type of
    information We need and the purpose of Our use. Except as specifically described in this
    Privacy Policy and Our general corporate privacy policy, We will only use Your personal
    information for the purpose it was collected. In this Privacy Policy “Device” means a
    mobile phone, handset, tablet or other mobile device enabled for internet access and/or
    communication.</p>

<h2>Consent and Opting Out</h2>

    for which the information will be used by expressly setting forth such purposes in Our
    privacy policy (please see the section ‘How and Why We Use This Information’

    will not, as a condition of the supply of the Services, require an individual to consent

    the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes. However, if You choose not to provide
    Us with certain information, We may not be able to provide You with certain, or all of,
    the Services or information.</p>

<p>10. You may withdraw Your consent to the ongoing uses or disclosures of personal
    information set out in this Privacy Policy at any time, subject to legal or contractual
    restrictions and reasonable notice. You will be informed of the implications of such
    withdrawal. You may opt out of receiving promotional and marketing communications by
    sending Your request to Us. You will also have options for removing Your information
    from Our database, not receiving future communications or no longer receiving Our
    Services.</p>

    o respond more accurately and efficiently to Your requests;<br>

    o meet legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>12. We may use Your email address to communicate with You about Our services. We may also
    keep and use anonymous aggregate statistics that do not personally identify You for
    various purposes including, but not limited to, analysis and reporting of usage
    patterns.</p>

<h2>Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information</h2>

<p>13. Our servers are located in the United States. Accordingly, in connection with
    providing You with the Services, Your personal information will be processed and stored
    in the United States and the governments, courts law enforcement or regulatory agencies
    of which may be able to obtain disclosure of Your personal information through the laws
    of the United States. If You are a resident of the European Economic Area, Your personal
    information will be transferred outside of the European Economic Area for processing and
    storage on Enflick’s behalf or to facilitate the use or functioning of the Services.</p>

<p>14. We only share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of
    Enflick in the following limited circumstances:<br>
    (a) With Your Consent: When We have Your consent. We require opt-in consent for the
    sharing of any sensitive personal information.<br>
    (b) Legal or other compulsion: In certain circumstances We may disclose personal
    information where We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
    disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (i) satisfy any applicable
    law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (ii) enforce
    applicable terms or use, license or other agreements applicable to the Services,
    including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or
    otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (iv) protect against imminent

    case if the acquiring company should plan to materially change this privacy policy, We
    will notify You beforehand.<br>
    (d) Aggregate Information: We reserve the right to use and disclose anonymous aggregate
    statistics for any purpose and to any third party in Our sole discretion.</p>

<p>15. From time to time We may employ third parties to help Us provide or improve the
    Services. These third parties may have limited access to databases of user information
    or registered member information of a Service solely for the purpose of helping Us
    provide or improve such Services and they will not be able to use the information about
    Our members or visitors for any other purpose.</p>

<p>16. Except where We are required by law to disclose personal information, We will require
    any person to whom We provide Your personal information to agree to comply with our then
    current Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that they
    comply with our Privacy Policy; however, to the maximum extent permitted by law, We will
    have no liability to You if any person fails to do so.</p>

<p>17. We will retain personal information that has been used to make a decision about an
    individual long enough to allow the individual access to the information after the
    decision has been made, and, in the event of an access request or a challenge, long
    enough to exhaust any recourse an individual may have under applicable law.</p>

<h2>Personal Information Safeguards</h2>

<p>18. In the event that Your personal information that is in Our control is to be
    transferred to a third party for processing, Enflick will use contractual or other means
    to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being processed by
    a third party.</p>

<p>19. We have deployed a variety of technology and security features to ensure the privacy
    of personal and anonymous information on Our system. We use procedural and technical
    safeguards to protect Your personal information against loss or theft, as well as
    against unauthorized access or disclosure, to protect Your privacy, including firewalls
    and encryption. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from
    unauthorized access by users inside and outside Enflick.</p>

<p>20. We will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new
    technologies become available. HOWEVER, “PERFECT SECURITY” DOES NOT EXIST ON
    THE INTERNET, THEREFORE, ENFLICK MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO
    THE SUFFICIENCY OF THESE SECURITY MEASURES. ENFLICK SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
    ACTUAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND
    WHATSOEVER, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) THAT RESULT FROM A LAPSE IN
    COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY BECAUSE OF A SECURITY BREACH OR TECHNICAL
    MALFUNCTION.</p>

<p>21. The Services may include advertisements regarding or otherwise contain hyperlinks to
    other websites, including those of Our business partners, vendors and advertisers.
    Advertisements for third parties and their products may be included with the Services
    and those third party advertisements and web sites may include a cookie, web beacons, or
    other device(s) of the third party. We do not have control over the cookies, web
    beacons, or other devices used by third parties and do not have access to whatever
    information they may collect. You acknowledge and agree We are not responsible for the
    content or for the privacy practices employed by third parties.</p>

<h2>Openness</h2>

<p>22. Upon written request, We will make readily available to You specific information
    about Our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information,
    other than confidential commercial information.</p>

<p>Accessing And Updating Personal Information</p>

<p>23. We make good faith efforts to provide You with access to Your personal information
    that We have retained and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete
    such data at Your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for
    legitimate business purposes.</p>

<p>24. Upon appropriate request, We will usually be glad to update or amend Your personal
    information that We have retained, but We reserve the right to use information obtained
    previously to verify Your identity or take other actions that We believe are
    appropriate.</p>

    practices to Enflick’s Privacy Officer. You may contact Our Privacy Offer through
