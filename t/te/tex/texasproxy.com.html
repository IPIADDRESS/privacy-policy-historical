<h3>Web proxy service:</h3>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: This is a free service and the only data we store through log files are website logs. This log details your IP address, the address of the website you visit, date, time and the files/sites you viewed via the web proxy. We do not link this data to your personal information.</li>
<li>Why we need this data: The website logs are needed to tell us what websites and files you have accessed via our network. We store these logs for 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<h3>VPN service:</h3>

<ul>
<li>What data we collect: We will store a time stamp and IP address when you connect and disconnect to our VPN service, the amount data transmitted (up- and download) during your session together with the IP address of the individual VPN server used by you. We do not store details of, or monitor, the websites you connect to when using our VPN service.</li>
<li>Why we need this data: We do this so that we can monitor the performance of our Site, for example it enables us to sort server nodes by the number of users connected, to limit your account to one concurrent IP address per VPN connection (to prevent shared accounts), resource analytics (to carry out usage analysis for administrative purposes) and to prevent abuse and fraud. This data is stored on our system for between 2 and 3 months unless we are required, for legal reasons or under exceptional circumstances (including our own investigations of fraud or abuse), to retain this data for an extended period.</li>

You can delete your account and emails at any time but your registration details are stored for no more than 2 years following the deletion of your account to be used as an identifier in case of any potential legal issues.</li>
<li>Why we need this data: We need this data so that you can receive emails (although please note that you can't send emails). You can use this anonymous email service as a temporary email inbox for when websites you do not necessarily trust that require an email address.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IP:PORT premium service:</h3>
