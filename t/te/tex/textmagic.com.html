<li>Required by any regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>

</ol>
</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="text-primary">Data Transfer</h4>
<ol>
<li>In order to provide the Services you request, it may be necessary for your data to be transferred to and stored by mobile network operators, telecommunications providers or other organisations in countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing. Textmagic will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information , we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
</ol>

<li>
<h4 class="text-primary">Confidentiality and Security</h4>
security for all personally-identifiable information (including all cell phone numbers, texts, messages and other data) is our priority. However, no data transmissions can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
