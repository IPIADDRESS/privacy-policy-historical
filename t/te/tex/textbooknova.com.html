					<h2>Textbook Nova Privacy Policy</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-body" style="padding:15px;">
					Last Updated: September 7th, 2016<br><br>
					
					<p>Nova Net LLC operates the website TextbookNova.com ("Textbook Nova", "the site").
					It is Nova Net LLC’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect through your use of our website.</p>

					<p><strong>Website Visitors</strong><br>
					Like most website operators, Textbook Nova collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
					This information is collected when the user visits the site.
					Textbook Nova’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Textbook Nova’s visitors use its website.
					From time to time, Textbook Nova may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
					Textbook Nova also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for any user on the website.
					Textbook Nova reserves the right to use this information to place an IP address into a temporary black list if we determine they are abusing the site.
					A user that is on our black list will be denied access to the website and the services provided until a time decided based on the severity of the abuse.
					By using the site you agree to the terms and conditions of this document and agree to be bound by the terms contained in this document.</p>

					<p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
					Certain visitors to Textbook Nova’s websites choose to interact with Textbook Nova in ways that require Textbook Nova to gather personally-identifying information.
					The amount and type of information that Textbook Nova gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
					For example, we may ask visitors who sign up to provide an email address.
					Textbook Nova does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
					And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
					In addition to the information contained in this privacy policy a user may request further information concerning particular services or the collection and processing of their data.</p>

					<p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong><br>
					Textbook Nova may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
					Textbook Nova may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
					However, Textbook Nova does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

					<p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
					Textbook Nova discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
					(i) need to know that information in order to process it on Textbook Nova’s behalf or to provide services available at Textbook Nova’s websites, and
					(ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
					Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Textbook Nova’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
					Textbook Nova will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
					Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Textbook Nova discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Textbook Nova believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Textbook Nova, third parties or the public at large.
					If you have supplied your email address through the Textbook Nova website, Textbook Nova may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Textbook Nova and our products.
					If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
					Textbook Nova takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
					A visitor's personally-identifying information may be used for legal purposes by Nova Net LLC, in Court or in the stages leading to possible legal action arising from improper use of the site or the related services.
					The user declares to be aware that Nova Net LLC may be required to reveal personal data upon request of public authorities.</p>

					<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
					A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
					Textbook Nova uses cookies to help Textbook Nova identify and track visitors, their usage of Textbook Nova website, and their website access preferences.
					Textbook Nova visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Textbook Nova’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Textbook Nova’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

					<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong><br>
					If Textbook Nova, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Textbook Nova goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
					You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Textbook Nova may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

					<p><strong>Ads</strong><br>
					Some JavaScript code and ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
					These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
					This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
					This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Textbook Nova and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
					Textbooknova.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com
					Amazon Services LLC ("Amazon") will have the ability to serve the visitors of this website with content and/or advertisements.
					A visitor that has been directed to Amazon by this site may have their information collected and Amazon will place and/or recognize cookies on the visitor's browser.
					Amazon has a separate and independent privacy policy which can be read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496">here</a>
					Certain content that appears on Textbooknova.com comes from Amazon Services LLC. This content is provided 'as is' and is subject to change or removal at any time.</p>

					<p><strong>Third-party links</strong><br>
					Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website.
					These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies, and they may choose to serve content and advertisements.
					We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.

					Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

					<p><strong>Google</strong><br>
					The site employes Google Analytics tracking to help monitor the site's usage and improve the platform.
					Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to the site and other sites on the Internet.
					Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.
					Google Analytics tracking will include Demographics and Interests Reporting on each user it has tracked.
					We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.
					To opt out, visitors can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page.
					Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</p>

					<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong><br>
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
					The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
					<br>
					According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
					Users can visit our site anonymously.
					Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
					Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
					You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.
					Can change your personal information by emailing us.</p>

					<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong><br>
					When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
					The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
					We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

															
					<p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br>
					Textbook Nova may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Textbook Nova’s sole discretion.
					Textbook Nova encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
					Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
