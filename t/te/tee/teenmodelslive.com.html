        How TeenModelsLive Protects Your Privacy?<p></p>
      <p>- We NEVER sell, rent or share Your personal information or e-mail address 
        with any other party!<br>
        - We may send You occasional promotional e-mails, and every e-mail will 
        contain an unsubscribe option.</p>
      <p>Not only we do respect Your privacy, we protect Your privacy!!!</p>
      <p>TeenModelsLive is occasionally contacted by third parties who, for marketing 
        purposes, want to purchase our mailing list and other sensitive customer 
        information derived from our database. Although there is no law forbidding 
        TeenModelsLive from selling such information, the trading of which is 
        an extremely lucrative business, TeenModelsLive is serious in its commitment 
        to protecting your personal privacy. We have never sold such personal 
        information about our customers to outside parties -- not even once -- 
        and we never will. As a general rule, TeenModelsLive collects only three 
        kinds of information about you:</p>
      <p>1. Information that You voluntarily provide to us or authorize us to 
        view, such as your name, address, credit-card and other account information 
        as submitted on the TeenModelsLive Membership Submission Form.</p>
      <p>2. "Log information" about the areas of TeenModelsLive that 
        You visit, that are accessible from the general internet environment.</p>
      <p>3. Private correspondence, such as the contents of telephone conversations, 
        chat client logs, faxes or letters to TeenModelsLive staff, e-mail messages 
        to performers or TeenModelsLive staff, performer chat client logs.</p>
      <p><br>
        Log information bears greater explanation:</p>
      <p>Log information typically consists of such things as your browser type 
        (i.e., Netscape or MSIE), your IP address (i.e., 102.316.52.11), the domain 
        name from which You are visiting TeenModelsLive (i.e., "aol.com"), 
        and the pages of TeenModelsLive that You visit. Like all internet services, 
        we analyze our log files to better understand which areas of TeenModelsLive 
        are more popular than others. And like most other large-scale internet 
        properties, we also use this information to "customize" the 
        TeenModelsLive experience to match your tastes. For example, if You first 
        visit TeenModelsLive by searching an internet portal for a search term 
        such as "voyeur" and clicking upon an TeenModelsLive banner 
        or link, TeenModelsLive may set a "cookie" on your computer 
        which records the term as a "search preference" (Note: Everyday 
        log-analysis programs such as WebTrends include such tracking of keyword-specific 
        traffic as a regular feature - indeed, using such tools, the administrators 
        of most websites on earth track traffic originating from search engines 
        by searched keyword).</p>
      <p>Later, as You navigate through TeenModelsLive, You will likely observe 
        that the content You see on TeenModelsLive tends to be tailored to match 
        your recorded search preference. Note: such cookies are "secure" 
        in that they cannot be read by other internet companies, but can only 
        be read by the web site which placed the cookie on Your computer.</p>
      <p>TeenModelsLive also uses your recorded "search preference" 
        information to better target and allocate marketing expenditures.<br>
        For example, if TeenModelsLive learns that, in aggregate, individuals 
        who search portals for terms such as "voyeur" are more likely 
        to purchase goods and services from TeenModelsLive than individuals who 
        search for terms such as "livecams", TeenModelsLive may allocate 
        greater portions of its marketing budget to targeting the former group, 
        and a smaller portion of its budget to target the latter group. By optimizing 
        marketing strategies in this manner, TeenModelsLive has more disposable 
        capital that can be deployed toward development efforts which improve 
        the TeenModelsLive platform and provide a richer customer experience for 
        all.</p>
      <p>Speaking of cookies, another kind of cookie that TeenModelsLive sets 
        is an "identification cookie". This cookie is written whenever 
        You successfully use your login and password to access a restricted area 
        of TeenModelsLive; the identification cookie is available only to individuals 
        who have already been verified as adults, via TeenModelsLive's verification 
        procedures. When TeenModelsLive's servers observe this identification 
        cookie on your computer, they recognize You and therefore might deliver 
        unmodified content as opposed to modified content - in effect, another 
        form of customized content tailored to suit your indicated preferences.</p>
      <p>Another question that might concern you: "Does TeenModelsLive outsource 
        to other companies any privacy-sensitive functions such as management 
        of its e-mail newsletter system, web hosting, or its e-commerce platform?" 
        Because TeenModelsLive is committed to safeguarding the integrity of your 
        personal information, we have elected to not use such services, despite 
        the fact that they are reasonably-priced and simplify the management task 
        of running a large and complex website operation.</p>
