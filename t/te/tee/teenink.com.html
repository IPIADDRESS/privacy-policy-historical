</center>
<br>


At <i>Teen Ink</i>, we respect your privacy. We do collect information from you, but it
is <i>Teen Ink's</i> policy and priority to ensure that all personal information remains
private and secure.<br><br>
<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>1. General</b></font><br> <br>To protect your privacy, <i>Teen Ink</i>:

<ol type="a" start="1">
	<li> Provides a privacy notice and/or a link to this Privacy Statement on all pages that  ask for personal information; 
	</li><li> Will not release personal identifying information about you without first obtaining consent; and 
	</li><li> Will not knowingly collect or use personal identifying information from children younger than 13 without parental consent.
</li></ol>
<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>2.  Basic Information
</b></font> <br><br>When you visit the <i>Teen Ink</i> website, we may collect some basic
information about your computer, including:<br>

<ol type="a" start="1">
	<li> IP address (your computer's unique signature) 
	</li><li> Operating system (e.g., Windows 95) 
	</li><li> Browser software (e.g., Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer) 
	</li><li> Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL) 
	</li><li> Geographic location (e.g., Philadelphia, PA.) 
</li></ol>The information we collect reflects the population as a whole rather than
focusing on individuals, and we use it to help us better understand the people
who visit <i>Teen Ink</i>.        This information helps us identify the most popular
areas on <i>Teen Ink's</i> website and        determine the effectiveness of <i>Teen Ink's</i>
promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose        some of this general
information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have       
seen and clicked on their advertisements. <br><br>

For the same purposes, we may use cookies - small text files placed on your
computer's hard        drive - to help us determine the type of content and sites
to which you link, the length of time        that you spend at any particular
site and the <i>Teen Ink</i> services you use. We use cookies        to personalize
<i>Teen Ink's</i> members' and visitors' experiences. Without cookies, it would        be
difficult for us to provide any personalized service or to fully understand
<i>Teen Ink</i>        readers needs. Cookies also tell us which advertising you have
seen on the <i>Teen Ink</i>         site, thereby allowing us to offer you a more diverse
selection of advertising information. <br><br>

The        cookies used in connection with
certain pages may allow <i>Teen Ink</i> to compile        demographic data (which is not
identifiable to a specific individual) about visitors to <i>Teen Ink</i>.<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>3.  E-mail</b></font><br><br>
We do collect the e-mail addresses of people who communicate with us
via e-mail to respond to these communications and to send future correspondence.
We may archive messages for quality        assurance purposes. In cases where
<i>Teen Ink</i> may use a third-party vendor to provide a        service (such as chat),
feedback or questions directed to <i>Teen Ink</i> about that service may be forwarded to
the vendor for a direct response to a reader.<br><br> For your protection, some of <i>Teen Ink's</i>
personnel have access to <i>Teen Ink's</i> bulletin boards, chat rooms and forums to help
       us maintain a safe and collaborative environment online. Currently, we do
not archive chat        dialogs, screen names or forum postings. We also do not
perform any analysis of chat room        discussions. We encourage you not to
give personal information or passwords to anyone on the bulletin board, in the
chat rooms or forums. When you disclose your personal information, it may be
collected        and used by others to send you unsolicited e-mail. If you
encounter any <i>Teen Ink</i> user        who is improperly collecting or using
information, please contact <i>Teen Ink</i>.<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>4. Personal Information</b></font><br><br>
When you join, enter contests or sign up for other
services at <i>Teen Ink</i>, we collect personal identifying information from you, which
may include the  following:<br><br>

<ol type="a" start="1">
	<li> First and last name; 
	</li><li> Home or other physical address;
	</li><li> E-mail address;
	</li><li> Phone number;
	</li><li> Any other information that identifies you as a specific individual; 
	</li><li> Any other information that, when tied to the above information, may identify you as a specific individual. 
	</li><li> Name of your school and name of your teacher 
	</li><li> Your age and date of birth
</li></ol>We collect this information on pages where you can submit your work to <i>Teen Ink</i>
for publishing consideration or register to join <i>Teen Ink</i> services and at other
locations where you can sign up for sweepstakes and contests. We give notice     
  at each location that asks for personal information, and such information will
be used only for        the purposes stated at the location of the collection
and/or within this Privacy Statement.        <br><br>
 We use information about <i>Teen Ink</i>
members and visitors for administrative and other        purposes that we deem
necessary to maintain and improve <i>Teen Ink's</i> services. Such        uses include
data transmission, customer surveys conducted by <i>Teen Ink</i> or third        parties,
e-mail or chat services and other future services. We reserve the right to use
third        parties to provide these services. These third parties may receive
certain personal identifying        information about you in order for them to
perform their services.        <br><br> We send member account passwords only to the
e-mail address given during the registration        process. All registrants
receive e-mail confirming their Registration. NEVER GIVE YOUR        PASSWORD TO
ANYONE. If someone claiming to represent <i>Teen Ink</i> in an e-mail or        chat room
asks for your <i>Teen Ink</i> password, DO NOT RESPOND. The only time we ask        for
your password is when you need to access to the <i>Teen Ink</i> system.<br><br>

<i>Teen Ink</i> cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use 
<i>Teen Ink</i> services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to release
information about        members who we believe are in violation of <i>Teen Ink's</i>
content guidelines, even without a        subpoena, warrant or court order. We
also reserve the right to report to law enforcement        agencies any
activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful. We save your personal
information indefinitely since we may need to contact you in the event we want
your permission to publish your work in the future. If you        would like us
to remove you from our data base, please contact us at        admin@teenink.com.
We maintain information on members who have been removed for        violating
<i>Teen Ink's</i> content guidelines in order to identify repeat offenders. From time to 
      time, we may contact members to inform them of improvements or enhancements
       to <i>Teen Ink</i> services.<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>5.  Credit Cards</b></font><br><br>
<i>Teen Ink</i> will use your credit card number in order to provide
you with the subscription or         goods or services that you request. It may
also be used for other purposes stated at the time        of collection, which
may require disclosure of your credit card number and other personal       
identifying information about you to third parties. Information collected by
<i>Teen Ink</i> is        securely stored on <i>Teen Ink's</i> computers, which are called
servers. Credit card        transactions take place solely on servers that offer
a higher level of security. <br><br>The        transactions are handled by a third-party
financial institution, which receives the credit card        number and other
personal identifying information in order to verify the credit card number       
and process the transaction. Only authorized <i>Teen Ink</i> employees have access to
this        information, in a manner consistent with industry standards.
Third-party vendors may also sell        products and services on <i>Teen Ink</i>, and
their policies may differ from those of  <i>Teen Ink</i>.<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>6.  Policies for Individuals Under 13 </b></font><br><br>

<i>Teen Ink</i> encourages parents and guardians
to spend        time online with their children and to participate in the
interactive activities offered on the        sites. <i>Teen Ink</i> encourages parents
and guardians to advise their children not to talk to  strangers, and to
teach children not to give out their names or other personal information.       
Parents and guardians should also teach their children never to fill out online
registration        forms without the parent's or guardian's knowledge and
consent. No information should be        submitted to or posted at the <i>Teen Ink</i>
web sites by children without the consent of their        parent or guardian. In
addition, when a child registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an       
e-mail about Registration and providing instructions on how the parent or
guardian can        delete the Registration if so desired. <br><br>Although children are
allowed to participate in contests,        if such a guest wins, notification and
prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in        the initial
Registration process. <i>Teen Ink</i> does not knowingly collect or use any personal     
  information from children under age 13 without obtaining express parental
consent. Express parental        consent means that <i>Teen Ink</i> obtains affirmative
agreement from a parent or legal        guardian that the child may divulge
personal information by transmitting a signed statement        by postal mail or
fax. <br><br>All general information collected from children is used only for statistical
       analysis, editorial participation, feedback and those purposes described
above and in the registration process. We do not give children's personal
information to third parties, regardless of        whether or not the children
choose to allow us to disseminate their personal information for       
promotional opportunities. <br><br>Note: <i>Teen Ink</i> defines "children" as minors younger
than age 13.<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="#993399" face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>7. Third Party Sponsors</b></font><br><br>
 When you join <i>Teen Ink</i>, you have the option of signing
up to        receive information from <i>Teen Ink's</i> third party sponsors. <i>Teen Ink</i> may
also hosts        promotions and sweepstakes that may be sponsored and
administered by outside parties.        The fact that <i>Teen Ink</i> merchandise may be
given away as prizes does not mean that  <i>Teen Ink</i> is the sponsor. We require that
outside parties conducting promotions and        sweepstakes on <i>Teen Ink</i> site
clearly identify who is conducting the promotion and state        their practices
concerning the use of personal identifying information. We will post privacy     
  information in the rules and/or login area for the promotions and sweepstakes
that we host.        To the extent that the privacy information relating to the
promotion or sweepstakes conflicts        with <i>Teen Ink's</i> Privacy Statement, the
specific privacy information regarding the        promotion or sweepstakes will
govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes. <br><br>
Third parties        that
receive information about you from <i>Teen Ink</i> at your request are obligated to:

<ol type="a" start="1">
	<li> Clearly indicate the sender of the e-mail message; and 
	</li><li> Provide you with a method of opting out from receiving future communications.
</li></ol>If you receive e-mail from a third party stating that is associated with <i>Teen Ink</i>,
yet you        do not want to receive promotional materials        from <i>Teen Ink</i>
or its sponsors, please follow the third party's removal procedures. If this     
  procedure is not successful, please contact us at admin@TeenInk.com.<br><br>

We do not control the actions of <i>Teen Ink's</i> members and visitors. If you disclose 
      personal information on a bulletin board, in a chat room, forum or anywhere
else on the site, it may be collected        and used by others. Additionally, be
aware that when you click on ad banners, they may        lead you to other sites
not operated by <i>Teen Ink</i>. These outside parties may have        different privacy
policies from ours. <i>Teen Ink</i> does not assume any responsibility for  actions
of third parties.
