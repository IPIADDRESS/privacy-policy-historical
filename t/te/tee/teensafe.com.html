			  <br>
			  <div class="clear mbsetup_txt"> Teensafe, Inc. ("Teensafe," "we," "us" or "our") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Teensafewebsite where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site") (we refer to the Site, the services and the software made available through the Site, collectively, as the "Teensafe Features").  As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the TeensafeFeatures how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and the Teensafe Features.  By visiting the Site or using any of the Teensafe Features, you consent to Teensafe's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies. <br>
			    <br>
			   This policy answers the following questions:
			   <ul>
			   <li style="line-height:22px;">What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li>
	       <li style="line-height:22px;">Will we share your personal information with third parties?</li>
			    <li style="line-height:22px;">
	      What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</li>

			  <div class="mb_option"><strong><i>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?<br><br></i></strong></div>
			  <div class="label_height"></div>
			  <div class="mb_option"><strong class="terms_headico">Types of Information We Collect</strong> <br><br>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you such as your name, email address, screen name, mailing address and phone number. You need to submit personal information to access the Site and the Teensafe Features. 
			  <br><br>
			  We collect personal information when you create an account through the Teensafe Features; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms and questionnaires; or receive customer or technical support. 
			      <br><br>
			To create an account for the Teensafe Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including a login name and password and your email address, mailing address and phone number. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the Teensafe Features.  If you sign up for one of our services which involves tracking personally identifiable information, we may also collect personally identifiable information from other internet sources and database services.  No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.

			  <div class="mb_option"><strong class="terms_headico">How We Use Your Personal Information</strong> <br><br>The personal information you provide to us will allow us to provide the services available through the Site; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service questions or issues; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, or special offers. We also use your email address as part of the Teensafe Features in sending you messages about the Teensafe Features and other general announcements.

			      <br><br>
			We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Teensafe Features.  We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.  You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Teensafe Features (the "Analytical Data"). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Teensafe Features users.
