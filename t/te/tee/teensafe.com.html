      <p><strong>Information We Collect And How We Use It</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Information We Need To Provide TAA’s Services: To provide TAA’s services, we need to collect personal, identifiable information about the Subscriber, about the Teen and about any person (Third-Party Contact) whom the Subscriber designates as eligible to receive reports from TAA about the Teen. This information includes, but is not limited to, the following: first and last name, shipping, mailing and/or billing address, credit card or banking account number, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, vehicle-related information and, on occasion, social security numbers. TAA also collects motorists’ reports about the Teen’s driving behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If you subscribe to any TAA GPS (Global Positioning System) related service, TAA may also collect information about the speed, direction and location of any GPS-enabled cellular telephones assigned to the account. </p>
      <p>TAA uses the information collected to provide you with the Teen Arrive Alive Welcome Kit, for billing, collecting payments, reporting to the Subscriber or to a Third-Party Contact about the Teen, informing the Subscriber or the Teen about products and promotions, troubleshooting service problems, improving services, personalizing the content and advertising that you see on the TAA website, to contact you and in any other way necessary to provide TAA services. TAA may also use this information to contact the Subscriber or the Teen about products, services or promotions offered by TAA or by one or more of TAA’s corporate sponsors, affiliates or rewards partners.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Information About Your Visit To Our website: Each time you visit our website, we automatically collect information about you.

For telephone contacts, we typically record the date and time of the call, the name of the caller and the reason for the call. Additionally, we may record telephone calls for training and quality control purposes. If you subscribe to any TAA services, or request changes to an existing service, we may record that information as well.

      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>How We Share Information</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> To TAA’s Service Providers: TAA relies on a variety of service providers. For example, one TAA service provider creates and stores speed, direction and location information about the GPS-enabled cellular telephone assigned to the Teen, while another service provider responds to customer service and sales inquiries made by telephone. TAA may share any information it collects with its service providers. These service providers are required by contract to maintain the confidentiality of any information TAA shares with them. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> To TAA Reward Partners: TAA offers exciting rewards to Teens who participate in the program and especially to those who consistently exhibit safe driving behavior. To help TAA’s Reward Partners make these offerings, TAA may share personal information about the Teen that is reasonably necessary for the Teen to participate in the Rewards Program. The Reward Partners may use this information to contact the Teen about reward winnings. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>

      </ul>
      <ul>

TAA will not permit another business to examine the information TAA has collected without a confidentiality agreement. TAA will not transfer the information it has collected unless the recipient agrees to provide privacy protections equal to or exceeding those established by this Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
