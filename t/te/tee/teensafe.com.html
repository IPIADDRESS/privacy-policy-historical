 <li style="line-height:22px;">Will we share your personal information with third parties?</li>

You need to submit personal information to access the Site and the Teensafe Features. 
            <br><br>
            We collect personal information when you create an account through the Teensafe Features; subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms and questionnaires; or receive customer or technical support. 
                <br><br>
          To create an account for the Teensafe Features, we require you to provide certain information to create your profile, including a login name and password and your email address, mailing address and phone number. Providing additional information beyond what is required to create an account is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the Teensafe Features.  If you sign up for one of our services which involves tracking personally identifiable information, we may also collect personally identifiable information from other internet sources and database services.  No information of this type will be collected unless you have registered for services that require it.

We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.  This process is known as de-personalizing your information.

                                         <li style="z-index: 6; position: absolute; display: none;">
			            While I was out of town, having my son's phone and facebook accounts on TeenSafe gave me a quick, easy way to check on my son from my hotel room.
			      </li>
			      <li style="z-index: 5; position: absolute; display: none;">
			            Teensafe is much more informative than the typical, "Fine" that I get from my child when I call to check in.
			      </li>
			      <li style="z-index: 4; position: absolute; display: none;">
			        My friend told me about this great, free site that helps her keep track of her teenage daughter's cell phone and website activity. TeenSafe is such a great resource!
			      </li>
			      <li style="z-index: 3; position: absolute; display: none;">
			        I checked out TeenSafe and was amazed at how easy it was to set up.
			      </li>
			      <li style="z-index: 2; position: absolute; display: none;">
			        After adding my son and daughter to TeenSafe, I feel assured that they're both a little safer.
			      </li>
			      <li style="z-index: 1; position: absolute; display: none;">
			        I know my child may not always make the best decisions. With TeenSafe, I have another way to help with decisions that I may not have otherwise known about.
