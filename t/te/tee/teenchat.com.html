        <p></p>
        <p>Your personal information is also collected to promote and market to you other services which we consider may be of interest to you. Before we do so, we will provide you with an opportunity to give us permission to send you marketing or promotional material (such as promotional email offers), via an opt-in mechanism. That is, we will send you such material only if you elect to receive it or if it is provided to you in response to your request.</p>
    <p></p><h3>TeenChat.com Websites</h3>
    TeenChat.com provides a range of web-based services, either through within TeenChat.com or through one of our related companies. Most of these services are provided on the TeenChat.com web site as well as some other affiliated domains.<p></p>
    <p>The marketing information provided on our websites will be determined by where you decide to visit on the site.</p>
    <p></p><h3>Personal information collected from our websites</h3>
    The types of personal information we collect from you will depend on how you use our web sites. Such information may include your name, date of birth, gender, current and previous addresses, telephone/mobile phone number, email address, bank account or credit card details, occupation, driver's licence number and your TeenChat.com nickname or password.<p></p>
    <p>If you choose not to provide personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the services you require, or the level of service on which we pride ourselves.</p>
    <p></p><h3>Other information</h3>
    Our websites record other information as well. This information is used to improve the structure and performance of those sites to provide users with an improved service. Whenever a page is requested from our web server, we record the time, date and URL of the request, along with information on the browser software that is being used.<p></p>
    <p>TeenChat.com uses "cookies". Cookies are pieces of information that a web site can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping. Cookies can make using our website easier by storing information about your preferences. This will enable you to take full advantage of the services we offer. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you'll find most major websites use them. Most Internet browsers are pre-set to accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can adjust your Internet browser to disable cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used.</p>
    <p></p><h3>When we disclose your personal information</h3>

         </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p></p><h3>Help us to ensure we hold accurate information</h3>
        TeenChat.com takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, the accuracy of the information we hold depends to a large extent on the information you provide. That's why we recommend you: 
     <ol>
          <li>Let us know if there are any errors in your personal information; and</li>
      <li>keep us up to date with changes to your personal information such as your name or address.</li>
     </ol>
        <p></p>
    <p></p><h3>You can access your personal information</h3>
    You have a right to access your personal information, subject to some exceptions allowed by law. If you would like to do so, please let us know by sending an email. You may be required to put your request in writing for security reasons. TeenChat.com reserves the right to charge a fee for searching for and providing access to your information.<p></p>
    <p></p><h3>Security of your information</h3>
    We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is stored securely. Transmissions sent to or from our websites are routinely monitored for quality control and systems administration. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from our online products or services. These activities are conducted at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security.<p></p>
    <p>Credit card information is among the most important data we collect. TeenChat.com operates secure servers to minimise the risk of unauthorised use of such information. Credit card information that is transmitted via our secure servers is encrypted in accordance with the highest standards over the EFTPOS network. For obvious reasons, please do not send credit card information through unsecured email.</p>
    <p></p><h3>Children's' privacy</h3>
    Children's' privacy is very important to us. We ask that children under the age of 18 have a parent or guardian verify their use of TeenChat.com. While TeenChat.com will make every reasonable effort to ensure that children's privacy and other rights are not compromised, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's Internet usage.<p></p>
    <p></p><h3>What else you should know about privacy</h3>
    Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer.<p></p>
    <p>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet (for example: in discussion forums, via email, or in chat sites) that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet and our websites.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions in relation to privacy, please contact us.</p>
