<p>Thank you for visiting alloymarketing.com, a website of Alloy Marketing and Promotions, LLC. This notice explains our online information collection and use practices and the choices you can make about the way we use and share such information. Please take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. OUR ONLINE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PRACTICES REGARDING INFORMATION OBTAINED OFFLINE.
REMEMBER IF YOU REGISTER WITH alloymarketing.com, PARTICIPATE IN A SURVEY, PURCHASE SOMETHING FROM US, REQUEST A CATALOG OR OTHER INFORMATION, ENTER ANY OF OUR CONTESTS, SWEEPSTAKES OR PROMOTIONS, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. AS WE UPDATE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICES, THIS POLICY MIGHT CHANGE, SO CHECK IT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME. </p><p>
<b>The Information We Collect.</b><br>
At alloymarketing.com you can do a variety of things! You may be able to request information, order products and/or services, enter contests, participate in surveys, vote in polls, subscribe to a service or participate in a chat room. The types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted) that may be collected at these pages could include: name, address, age, date of birth, gender, grade level, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services. You can view or change your information at any time. Send an e-mail to myinfo@alloymarketing.com.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address for us to send information to regarding one of our programs. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages includes: recipient's name, address, age, date of birth, grade level, e-mail address, gender and telephone number.
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e. generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink).
How We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) you have submitted. Examples of us using your personal information for the purpose(s) submitted include if you request information online, we will send to such information or if you have won a contest, sending to you an email notification that you have won. In addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey. For example, we may send to you an e-mail regarding special offers and announcements about products or services offered by us. We may also contact you offline. For example, when you provide your mailing address, we may send to you in the mail special offers, promotions and announcements, which we think may be of interest to you. If you want us to stop using the personal information you provided in these ways, contact us at MYINFO@alloymarketing.com. </p>
<p><b>How We Share Your Personal Information.</b> <br>
We will not share the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); (d) with other persons or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy.</p>
<p>Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you request information regarding financial aid, we may provide the information provided to a third party lender so that they can send to you directly the information you requested or if you enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, we may forward your information to such third party. </p>
<p>We may seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail).</p>
<p>We do not consider any companies that are within our "family" of companies to be "third parties" for purposes of this policy. Thus, we may also share personal information provided online with companies owned directly or indirectly by Alloy, Inc. Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy.</p>
<p>Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you provide online with certain companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline. Such companies may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers.  If you want us to stop sharing your personal information with these companies, please contact us at myinfo@alloymarketing.com. If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.</p>
<p>If we do share personal information to a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information. </p>
<p>We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how our site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.</p>
<p><b>Collection of Information by Others.</b><br>
Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should check the other sites' privacy notices since we have no control over information that is submitted to or collected by them.</p>
<p>We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies. 
</p>
<p><b>Cookies.</b><br>To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences.

<p><b>Clickstream Data. </b><br>
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to alloymarketing.com. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally identifiable information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of alloymarketing.com, how visitors navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve our site. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate.</p>
<p><b>Supplementing Information.</b><br>
From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through alloymarketing.com may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than alloymarketing.com, including both offline and online sources.</p>
<p><b>Discussions and Community Tools.</b><br>
We may, from time to time, make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and other community tools available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using alloymarketing.com and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may use publicly posted information.</p>
<p><b>Our Commitment to Security.</b><br>
We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online as well as offline. When your personal information is passed onto non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we require that they also have in place the appropriate safeguards. We cannot, however, guarantee that they do so. </p>
