  requested and/or paid for. We also use your information to deliver customized 
  services to you; for member support purposes; and for efforts to monitor and 
  ensure against fraud. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected

  and is only intended for use by the COMPANY. We generally will use your information

  to ensure payment for subscription services. <br>
  VI. Special Cases. </p>
<p>It is our policy not to use or share the personal information about Non-Members 
  or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also 
  providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated 
  uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Non-Members or Members, 
  or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through 
  our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it 
  is reasonable to do so, including: </p>
<p>1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
  regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information; </p>
<p>2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring 
  legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy 
  or other user policies; </p>
<p>3. To operate our Services properly; </p>
<p>4. To protect ourselves, our Members, and the general public. We specifically 
  reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in 
  the event that a crime – including, but not limited to, fraud-related offense 
  – is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by lawful 
  criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court 
  orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable 
  power to obtain such process. </p>
<p>5. We will cooperate with law enforcement authorities, private-party litigants, 
  and others seeking information about our end users to the extent required by 
  applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, 
  or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, or writs. 
</p>
<p>VII. Transmittals From Us.</p>
<p>We presently do not intend to send e-mails to our Members, other than in response 
  to specific Member inquiries; and/or in order to provide Members with system 
  notices and other information specifically relating to your account. In the 
  future, this policy may be subject to change, and we could opt to initiate the 
  sending of other correspondence including, but not limited to, Member announcements. 
  The implementation of such changes will be reflected in the Site's privacy policy. 
  We strongly advise our Members to periodically review the terms of this policy 
  in order to stay apprised of any such changes. </p>
<p>If you provide your information to us, use the Site, or subscribe to any of 
  our services, you will have created a commercial relationship with us. Even 
  though the Site does not intend to provide Members with e-mail advertising materials, 
  your use of the Site and its services constitutes your understanding and consent 
  that even unsolicited commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not 
  SPAM as that term is defined under the law. </p>
<p>VIII. Public Forums and Member Directories.</p>
<p>A. Public Forums – At the time of the institution of this Policy, we do 
  not offer any public forums, nor do we provide services that allow Members to 
  post messages to the public, nor to the membership at large. Nevertheless, we 
  reserve the right to offer this service in the future. Any information, other 
  than password and e-mail address, posted to a Forum should immediately be considered 
  to be public information. Public forums are accessed via e-mail address, user 
  name, and password. </p>
<p>B. Member Directories – Any information provided in a user profile, member 
  directory, or other related service should be considered to be private information. 
  Such information will not be made public or visible in any way. </p>
<p>IX. Our Commitment To Data Security. </p>
<p>We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of 
  all sensitive end-user information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity 
  and security of our network and systems. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that 
  our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers' from illegally 
  obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such 
  breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are 
  unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk 
  of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security 
  measures.</p>
<p>Further, we do not provide user information to third parties; nor will we sell, 
  rent or provide any of your information to other entities such as advertisers, 
  or other companies selling services similar to this COMPANY's services </p>
<p>X. How To Access Or Modify Your Information. </p>
<p>We offer our Members the opportunity to access or modify information provided 
  during registration. To access or modify such information, contact our Customer 
  Service Department at support@teenpinkvideos.com.</p>
