TeenFreeway is by definition for teenagers (i.e. 13 and older) -- and older
folks who are teenagers at heart!&nbsp; You must be 13 or older to participate
in any TeenFreeway promotions.&nbsp; For those sites for which TeenFreeway is a
conduit, again, you must read the privacy guidelines of that site which may
differ materially from those of TeenFreeway.</font>
