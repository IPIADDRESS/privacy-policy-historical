  <h2>When and how we share information with others</h2>
  <p><strong>Registered Candidates:</strong><br>
    When you register with Technojobs we create an account for you and store your data in one of our UK based servers. When you upload your CV, this too is processed and maintained in association with your account in one of our UK based servers. We will process your CV for the purpose of rendering it searchable by our clients, who engage with us for the purpose of recruiting staff. </p>
  <p><strong>Corporate Clients:</strong><br>
    As a client of Technojobs we create an account for you and store your data in our USA based CRM system, and UK based finance system. </p>
  <p><strong>In both cases:</strong><br>
    We do not otherwise reveal your personal data to third-parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) it’s in connection with the recruitment services of Technojobs Ltd; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law (for example, to comply with a search warrant, subpoena or court order), enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (6) to address disputes, claims, or to persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf. We may also gather aggregated data about our customers and Site visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners, service providers, advertisers and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.<br>
    In the course of our business to help you search and get a job, Technojobs may make personal information available to third parties such as employers and recruiters.</p>
  <p>The Technojobs Ltd website uses interfaces with social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. If you choose to "like" or share information from the Technojobs Ltd website through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If you are a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your site visit to your personal data.</p>
  <h2>Transferring personal data from the EU to the US</h2>
  <p>Technojobs Ltd has its headquarters and main servers here in the United Kingdom. We also utilise the CRM services of a company located in the United States (Salesforce) to store information about our corporate clients (NOT candidate data). Information we collect from you will be processed in either the UK or the USA depending upon the product or service you have purchased from us or we are providing. The United States have not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Technojobs Ltd relies on the USA Privacy Shield to govern the transfer of data to the USA. In particular, Technojobs Ltd collects and transfers to the USA personal data only: with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfil a compelling legitimate interest of Technojobs Ltd in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. Technojobs Ltd endeavours to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Technojobs Ltd and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Technojobs Ltd also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by minimising the data that we collect and store about you. </p>

You have a right to correct (rectify) the record of your personal data maintained by us if it is inaccurate. You may request that we erase that data or cease processing it, subject to certain exceptions. You may also request that Technojobs Ltd cease using your data for direct marketing purposes.
