                          To take full advantage of SSL technology we recommend 
                          that you use a browser with strong encryption technology 
                          such as Netscape's Navigator version 4.5 and above or 
                          Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 4.0 or higher. 
                          You can download these browsers directly from <a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/index.html?cp=djuc1">Netscape</a>

                          How secure is your computer from hackers? You can go 
                          to <a href="https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2">ShieldsUp</a>

                        <p class="contenthdr">Anti<a name="Anti"></a>-Virus Software</p>
                        <p>Make sure you install an anti-virus program on your 
                          computer. Viruses known as Trojan Horses can by sent 
                          to you via e-mail and capture important information 
                          stored in your computer such as passwords or documents 
                          and send them to someone else. New viruses appear almost 
                          daily so it is important to update your virus software 
                          frequently. Another way to protect yourself is not to 
                          open e-mails from unknown sources.</p>
