            	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><em>Version effective: June 13, 2011</em></p>
<p>Technorati Media (“we,” “our” or “us”) is an online advertising network<em>. </em>Our  customers include advertisers and other ad networks (our “Clients”).  These Clients buy and sell space on websites, blogs, and other media  (“Publishers”), and we provide the technology that displays their ads on  the Publisher sites. We may receive the ads directly from the Client  and serve them directly on the Publisher site, or there may be other ad  networks, agencies or exchanges (each of which may be our Client)  situated between the advertiser and the Publisher site. As part of our  services, we will attempt to find Publishers where the ads from our  Clients are most likely to be helpful and appreciated, as well as using  information received from Publishers as described below. To do this, we  may collect information about the types of people that visit the  Publisher site, view the ads, and click on the ads to learn more about  the product, service or company. The more we learn about the audience,  the better the fit of ads with Publishers, and the more useful the  Publisher site is to the audience. That’s where you come in; as part of  that audience we are interested in the types of Publishers you visit,  and the types of ads you are likely to be interested in. That way we can  try to avoid showing you ads for products that are <em>not </em>interesting  to you. Your privacy is important to us so we have developed this  policy to give you details as to what information about you we will  collect when we perform these services, and what choices you have  relating to our use of that information. <em></em></p>
<h3><strong>What This Policy Covers</strong></h3>
<p>This policy only addresses information that we collect as a function  of providing services to Clients and displaying ads on Publisher sites.  It does not address information and privacy issues relating to the  access and use of the Technorati Media website itself, or any of the  websites that Technorati Media, or its parent company Technorati, Inc.,  owns, controls or operates separate from the services we provide to our  Clients and Publishers. That uses of information is addressed by  Technorati, Inc.’s general privacy policy found at <a href="http://www.technorati.com/privacy-policy">www.technorati.com/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Information Collection &amp; Use</strong></h3>
<p>Information can be either Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)  or non-Personally Identifiable Information (“non-PII”). PII is  information that directly identifies you, such as your name, address,  email address, and telephone number. Non-PII is information that is not  specifically associated with your identity, such as context information,  records of what you click on while web browsing (such as a hyperlink),  click-stream data, demographic and behavioral data, the IP address from  which a website or ad is viewed or accessed, the ads displayed on a  Publisher site, which ads you click on and how often, and generally  other aggregate or statistical information that is not PII.</p>
<p><em>We do not collect PII as part of our services relating to ads served for Clients on Publisher sites. </em>If  you click on an ad served by us, you may be directed to a third party  site, where the advertiser may request PII from you. If so, the  collection and use of your PII is governed by the privacy policy for  that advertiser’s website, and not this policy.</p>
<p>We use the non-PII collected from Publisher sites and through Client  ads to provide our services to you, Clients and Publishers, selecting  the ads that you see, so that you are more likely to see ads that are  useful to you (also known as “targeting”), internal business operations,  planning, evaluation, improvement and enhancement of performance of our  services, and external performance reporting. We may add non-PII from  other sources (e.g., other ad networks, information provided by Clients)  to the non-PII that we collect, again for the above purposes.</p>
<h3><strong>Information Sharing</strong></h3>
<p>We sometimes share aggregated information with our Clients and  Publishers, in particular advertisers, to help them improve their ads  and offer you a better experience. We do not link this aggregate non-PII  with any PII from any source, so you will not be identified as an  individual to any Client. We may share aggregated statistics on our  services and performance with Clients, Publishers, business partners or  outside vendors without permission. As part of our agreements with  Clients and Publishers, we require them to use any information they  receive from us in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,  and with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use other companies and people to perform tasks on our  behalf. For example, as noted above, some ads are served through  multiple networks, agencies, exchanges and ad servers. We will share  your information with these providers only for the purpose of allowing  us to supply our services and deliver the ads to the Publishers.</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to disclose any information we collects if  we believe in good faith that its release is necessary to (1) comply  with the law; (2) enforce or apply terms and conditions of use and other  agreements; (3) or protect the rights, property or safety of our  employees, Clients, Publishers, affiliates, and others.</p>
<p>Finally, in the event Technorati Media experiences a business  transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of  all or a portion of its assets, any information governed by this policy  will be part of the assets transferred. We reserve the right to make  such a transfer, and you consent to the transfer and continued use of  such information by the acquiring party, but only in accordance with the  terms of this policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Collection Technology and Opt-out</strong></h3>
<p>We collect non-PII by many means, but all of them are based in some  way on technology associated with the ads served on Publisher sites. In  particular, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons and other types of  collection technology.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer to track  session data, identify that your computer has visited a Publisher site  or seen an ad before, and perform other useful functions. A cookie takes  up only a small amount of space in a folder on your hard drive, and is  not an applet or other type of program. A session cookie expires when  you exit your browser. A persistent cookie stays on your computer until  it is deleted.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to reject all cookies, ask your permission  before accepting a cookie, or to remove all cookies. Without the  cookies, however, you may not be able to experience all of the features  of the site or ad.</p>
<p>Pixels and web beacons are a line of code embedded in a website, ad  or used by an ad server to track navigation and other activity on a  particular webpage (e.g., which ads are clicked).</p>
<p>Third parties (including, without limitation, Clients and Publishers)  may use cookies or other information collection technology on their  sites. We have no access or control over these uses or technology. This  policy does not cover the use of cookies or other technology or  collection of information by any third parties.</p>
<h3><strong>Opting Out</strong></h3>
<p>You can opt out of our ad optimization in two ways:</p>
<p>1. Block      all cookies by disabling cookie use in your browser. This may cause some      sites to work incorrectly.</p>
<p>2. Use      our opt-out tool:&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.technoratimedia.com/optout">Click here to opt-out</a> by setting a special opt-out      cookie that tells our system to ignore you.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>If you choose to opt out using our tool, you need to repeat the  process for each computer or browser you use, and every time you clear  your cookies.</p>
<h3><strong>Security and Confidentiality</strong></h3>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure  the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate  physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure  the information we collect. We review these safeguards regularly and  take commercially reasonable steps to ensure they meet current industry  standards. You should be aware, however, that no system has perfect  security and Technorati Media cannot and does not assume responsibility  for the security of information beyond such industry standards and its  legal obligations.</p>
<h3><strong>Collection of Information from Children</strong></h3>
<p>Our services, and the ads we deliver, are not intended for children  under fourteen (14) years of age. We do not knowingly develop services  or direct ads at children. Furthermore, as noted above, we do not  knowingly collect any PII from children or otherwise.</p>
<h3><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong></h3>
<p>This policy is a living document that will change due to internal and  external requirements. We may modify this document as we add new  features and new services. Changes in information collection practices  and technology may also suggest changes in the policy. Changes in the  law may also require us to modify our information collection and use  practices, which modifications will be reflected in this policy.  Accordingly, Technorati Media reserves the right to modify this policy  at any time. Although we will attempt to make you aware of material  changes through posts on the <a href="http://www.technoratimedia.com/">www.technoratimedia.com</a> website and other appropriate places, we are not obliged to do so. You  should check the date (shown above) on the version of this policy posted  on the website occasionally to remain current.</p>
