                  <a href="#info"><u><strong>A</strong></u><strong><u>ctive Information Collection</u></strong></a><br>
                  Like many other Web sites, we  actively collect information from our visitors both by asking specific  questions on the Web Site and by permitting you to communicate directly with us  via e-mail.&nbsp; Some of the information that  you submit during the registration process or while making a purchase may be  personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified  with you, such as your name, business name, address, phone number, fax number,  e-mail address, etc.).&nbsp; Also, if you  place an order, you may be required to provide financial information.</p>
                <p class="style42">When you visit the Web Site, we  will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you  provide it to us voluntarily.&nbsp; If you  choose to register with the Web Site, during the registration process you will  be asked for both personal and demographic information, most of which is required  in order to complete the registration.&nbsp;  We will inform you which information is optional.&nbsp; If you opt not to register with the Web Site,  you still can visit the Web Site but may not be able to receive or view certain  content such as our newsletter.</p>
                <p class="style42">Techlicious does not have control  over the privacy policies applied by any other party that you may disclose  information to.&nbsp; Third party sites that  are linked to from the Web Site are not under the control of Techlicious and we  are not responsible for their content or privacy policies.&nbsp; If you would like information on any other  party’s privacy policy, you should contact that party directly, and we  encourage you to do so.</p>
                <p class="style42"><strong><u>Passive Information Collection</u></strong><br>
                  As you  navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected  (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using  various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection.&nbsp; Like most Web site operators, we track IP  addresses, use both session and persistent cookies, and assign Internet  tags.&nbsp; Our system also automatically  gathers information about the areas you visit on this site and collects  operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser,  type of computer, operating systems, Internet service providers and the domain  name of the Web Site from which you linked to our site.<br>
                  In addition,  when you view the Web Site, we may store some information on your  computer.&nbsp; This information will be in  the form of a cookie or similar file and will help us in many ways.&nbsp; For example, cookies allow us to tailor a Web  site or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.&nbsp; Most Internet browsers enable you to erase  cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning  before a cookie is stored.&nbsp; Please refer  to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these  functions.&nbsp; Techlicious does not collect  personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie information  collected automatically to your previously submitted personally identifiable  information.</p>
                <p class="style42">                  We passively  collect information to understand what areas of the Web Site are most popular,  which areas may require improvement and what technologies are being used by our  visitors.&nbsp; This information helps us to  update and improve the Web Site.&nbsp; We also  use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security  breaches and to provide you with a safe online environment.<br>
                      </p>
                <p class="style42"><strong><em><a href="#uses">HOW TECHLICIOUS USES YOUR INFORMATION</a></em></strong><br>
                  Techlicious uses your personal  information to enhance the operation of the Web Site and allow you to use all  of its features. </p>
                <p class="style42">Your contact information (e-mail  addresses, name) and demographic information (e.g., age, location, income  range) will be used for the purposes for which you supplied it to us (e.g.,  registering with the Web Site, receiving newsletter, etc.), to send you related  notices or promotional materials and to respond to your comments or requests  for information.&nbsp; If you direct comments  to us or you request information from us, we may ask you to verify certain  location information so that we can be assured that the response or information  we provide is appropriate for that geographic location.&nbsp; We may also enhance or merge personally  identifiable information with data obtained from third parties for the same  purposes.&nbsp; </p>
                <p class="style42">Techlicious will not give or sell  your personally identifiable information to any outside organization for the  organization's own use without your consent.&nbsp;  Techlicious may disclose your personal information to the reputable vendors  that assist us in processing information or delivering the items that our  customers order.&nbsp; These vendors are  restricted from using the information for any purpose other than helping us to  provide products and services.</p>
                <p class="style42">Techlicious does not otherwise  distribute to third parties your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Techlicious, however, will have no liability  for disclosure of information obtained due to errors in transmission or the  unauthorized intervention of third parties. </p>
                <p class="style42">Techlicious may provide aggregate  statistics about our customers, sales, online traffic patterns and related  information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not include  any personally identifying information.&nbsp; Techlicious  also will disclose any information that it is required to disclose by law or by  an appropriate government authority.</p>
                <p class="style42">Although Techlicious does not  currently rent, sell, or otherwise share your information with third parties  for purposes unrelated to this site, it may do so in the future.&nbsp; If you do not want your information to be  shared, you should contact us at <a href="mailto:info@techlicious.com">info@techlicious.com</a> as described in Section  3.</p>
                <p class="style42">Some of our  advertisers may display ads on the Web Site that solicit, or contain technology  to collect, information about our users.&nbsp;  This information is collected and used by our advertisers, and is  outside of our control.&nbsp; If you have any  questions about a banner advertisement, you should contact the responsible  advertiser directly.<br>
                    </p>
                <p class="style42"><strong><em>CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW TECHLICIOUS USES  YOUR INFORMATION</em></strong><br>
                  We have created mechanisms to  provide you with the following control over your information:</p>
                <p class="style42">You may send us an e-mail message at <a href="mailto:info@techlicious.com">info@techlicious.com</a> to request access to,  correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.&nbsp; To protect your privacy, we will only respond  to e-mail messages sent from the e-mail address you used to set up your  account.&nbsp; Should you elect to have your  information deleted, we will also delete your user account.<br>
                  If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you  may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are  being sent.&nbsp; If you do so, please note  that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
                <p class="style42">If you no longer  wish to receive information or promotional materials from us by e-mail you may  opt out of receiving these communications.&nbsp;  We offer two methods for such opt-out choices.&nbsp; If we have sent you a promotional e-mail, you  may send us a return e-mail asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions.&nbsp; You also may send us an e-mail stating your  request addressed to info@techlicious.com.</p>
                <p class="style42">You should  review this Privacy Policy carefully, because if you do not agree with our  practices, your ultimate choice is not to use the Web Site.&nbsp; Remember, by using any part of the Web Site,  you accept and agree to our privacy practices.&nbsp;  If we update this Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Web Site  (following the posting of the revised Privacy Policy) means that you accept and  agree to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p class="style42"><strong><em>HOW TECHLICIOUS PROTECTS YOUR INFORMATION</em></strong><br>
                  We work  hard to protect your personal information.&nbsp;  We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity  and security of our databases, including the use of firewalls and restricted  access to data.</p>
                <p class="style42">The safety and security of your information also depends on  you.&nbsp; If you have access to  password-protected features, never share your password with anyone else, notify  us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached, and  remember to log off of this site before you leave your computer.&nbsp; We further urge you to be careful about  giving out personal information in public areas of this site like chat rooms or  bulletin boards.&nbsp; When you provide  information in these forums you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; The information you share may be viewed by  any user of this site.</p>
                <p class="style42">This site contains links to other  Web sites operated by third parties that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We cannot control these third party sites,  which may collect personal information from you.&nbsp; When you follow a link and leave this site,  you do so at your own risk.</p>
                <p class="style42"><strong><em><a href="#children">WHAT TECHLICIOUS DOES ABOUT CHILDREN  VISITING THE WEB SITE</a></em></strong><br>
                  The Web Site  is not intended for children under the age of 13.&nbsp; We will not knowingly collect information  from site visitors in this age group.&nbsp; We  encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and  the information they disclose online.&nbsp; If  a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or  guardian of that child may contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@techlicious.com">info@techlicious.com</a> if they would like this information  deleted from our records.&nbsp; We will use  reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases.</p>
                <p class="style42"><strong><em>HOW YOU CAN CONTACT TECHLICIOUS</em></strong><br>
                  If you have submitted personally  identifiable information through the Web Site or an interactive advertisement,  or if someone else has submitted your personally identifiable information  through the Web Site or an interactive advertisement, and you would like to  have that information deleted from our marketing databases, please contact us  via e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@techlicious.com">info@techlicious.com</a>.&nbsp; We  will then use reasonable efforts to remove your personally identifiable  information from our files. You also may contact us to request the personally  identifiable information that Techlicious has collected about you through the  Web Site or interactive advertisements.&nbsp; Techlicious  will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any  factual inaccuracies in this information.</p>
