This change in the entity you contract with will become effective either from 1 January 2016 (if you are a new customer after that date) or, the next time your TechValidate account renews (if you are an existing customer). As a result, if you have contracted with SurveyMonkey Inc. and you renew that contract on or after January 1, 2016, your contract will be assigned to SurveyMonkey Europe (our Irish company) upon such renewal date. The change in contracting entity will also result in SurveyMonkey Europe becoming the new data controller and data processor for certain personal data you provide to us to receive the services, but the ways in which we handle and process your data will not otherwise change. If you are an existing customer, we will consider that you have consented to these changes if you renew your contract and continue to use our services.</p></div>
<br>

<p><span>This privacy policy applies to all the
TechValidate products, services and websites offered by SurveyMonkey Inc. and
SurveyMonkey Europe and their affiliates, except where otherwise noted
(hereinafter "surveyMonkey"). SurveyMonkey respects individual privacy and
values the confidence of its customers, employees, clinical trial participants,
consumers, business partners and others. Not only does SurveyMonkey strive to
collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the
laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of
upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. SurveyMonkey
has provided this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures
regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive
when you visit and use www.TechValidate.com (the "Site") (whether as
a registered user or a non-registered visitor), when you participate in the
Program (as a Vendor, through your Vendor Users or as a Customer, through your
Customer Users), or when you access, download, purchase or use any information,
services, products, hardware or software or other content (including but not
limited to TechFacts) appearing on the Site (collectively, the
"Services"). Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used
in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our TechValidate Website
Terms of Use or in our TechValidate Terms of Service &amp; License Agreement,
as applicable. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will
notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the
Site or through a message sent to your registered email address. Unless we
provide you with separate notice and an opportunity to opt out, information
will be treated in accordance with the Policy that was in place when the
information was collected.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Data Integrity: Collection and Use of
Personal Information</span></b></p>

<p><span>Our primary goals in collecting information
are to provide and improve our Site, Program and Services, to administer any
registration or account and to enable users to enjoy, easily navigate, use or
participate in the Site, Program and Services, as applicable.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>(a) Vendor User Personal Information.</span></b></p>

<p><span>As part of the registration process for the
Program, and from time to time thereafter, SurveyMonkey will collect certain
personally identifiable information from Vendor Users that can be used to
contact or identify the Vendor Users in order to administer the Vendor's
account ("Vendor User Personal Information"). Vendor User Personal
Information includes, but is not limited to, a Vendor User's first and last
name, company name, email address, telephone and fax numbers, Vendor company
password, domain address, and other personal information listed in our Vendor
registration form.</span></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey's primary goal in collecting
Vendor User Personal Information is to enable SurveyMonkey to contact and
communicate with a Vendor regarding the Program or activities relevant to a
Vendor, to provide a Vendor with a smooth and efficient experience of the
Program, to process fees and charge a Vendor for participation in the Program
or for any Services it has selected, to administer any Vendor inquiries and to
contact a Vendor about modifications to the status of any TechFacts or about
any new or existing products and services that might be of interest to a
Vendor.</span></p>

<p><span>As requested by a Vendor, SurveyMonkey will
contact and communicate with Customer Users to inquire about their experiences
with Vendor and Vendor Products. SurveyMonkey will share some of Vendor's
information (including name, address, other contact information and Vendor
Products to be reviewed by the Customer Users).</span></p>

<p><b><span>(b) Customer User Personal Information.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Under the Program, Vendors provide
SurveyMonkey with contact information of Customer Users and request that
SurveyMonkey contact such Customer Users on their behalf. "Customer User
Personal Information" means information about a Customer User that can be
used to contact or identify such user. Customer User Personal Information may
include, but is not limited to, the Customer User's company name, individual
contact name, and email. SurveyMonkey requires that Vendors do not breach any
obligations they have to Customer Users or to Customers in providing such
contact information for these purposes and that they comply with all laws
relating to privacy in disclosing such information to SurveyMonkey.</span></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey uses Customer User Personal
Information to process, validate and verify a Customer User's identity, to
contact and communicate with that Customer User regarding the Customer User's
experiences with a Vendor and the applicable Vendor Products or activities
relevant to the Customer User, to provide the Customer Users with a smooth and
efficient experience of the Program, and to contact and communicate with the
Customer User about modifications to the status of any TechFacts or about any
new or existing products and services that might be of interest to the Customer
User or Customer.</span></p>

<p><span>If a Customer User has visited the Site
solely to respond to a Questionnaire about a particular Vendor, and the
Customer User's activities on the Site are limited to responding to that
Questionnaire, SurveyMonkey will not share that Customer User's Customer User
Personal Information with any other Vendor. However, a Customer User may
independently choose to provide us with Customer User Personal Information (for
instance, in order to view certain assets such as whitepapers, videos, or other
information), either by visiting or browsing the Site after completing a
Questionnaire – in that case, SurveyMonkey may share that Customer User's
Customer User Personal Information with other Vendors as detailed herein. </span></p>

<p><span>TechFacts are provided on an anonymous
basis, – that is, no Customer User Personal Information will be displayed
in a TechFact unless the Customer User authorizes the use of the Customer
User's name and company affiliation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(c) Viewing TechFacts.</span></b></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey assigns a unique TechValidate
identification number (a "TVID") to each TechFact. The TVID will
appear on each copy of the TechFact. The Site is designed so that visitors may
look up and view TechFacts without the collection of any personally
identifiable information (except for such visitor's internet protocol (IP)
address).</span></p>

<p><b><span>(d) Log Data.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When you visit the Site, whether as a
registered Vendor User, Customer User or a visitor just browsing the Site, our
servers automatically record and collect information that your browser sends
whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include
information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address,
the geographic location of the IP address you are using to access the Internet,
browser and platform type, referring/exit pages, pages of our Site that you
visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site,
access times and dates, and other statistics.</span></p>

<p><span>We use this Log Data to monitor and analyze
use of the Site and the Service and for internal purposes such as to
administer, improve and customize the Site, to help SurveyMonkey understand and
analyze how the Site is being used, to track aggregate Site usage, to provide
technical administration, to increase the Site's functionality and
user-friendliness and to better tailor the Site to our visitors' needs. We do
not use Log Data in association with other personal information, though we may
aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information to attempt to provide you with
a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to
analyze and understand how our Site and the Services are used.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(e) Cookies.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Like many websites, we use
"cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that
we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use
cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your
last logged email address for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize
session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand
how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web
traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are
deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then
close your browser.</span></p>

<p><span>You can instruct your browser, by changing
its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you
may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all (or any) functionality
of the Services.</span></p>

<p><span>For more details see our Cookies Policy
<a href="/cookies-policy">here</a>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(f) Communications with SurveyMonkey.</span></b></p>

<p><span>If you contact us by email through the
Site, through participation in the Program, through use of the Services or
otherwise, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence,
and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in
your message, to respond to you.</span></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey may contact you with
newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may
be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to
receive such communications from SurveyMonkey, you may follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in any of the communications (or update your preferences
if you have a registered account).</span></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey may also request that you
provide personal information when you request promotional information, when you
complete a Customer User survey, or when you participate in contests.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(g) Phishing.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Identity theft and the practice known as
"phishing" are of great concern to SurveyMonkey. Safeguarding
information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do
not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your company
ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or
unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.. In addition, in using the
Program or Services, please do not ask your Customer Users for credit card
details, social security information, passwords, or similar types of
information—we may remove questionnaires without notice that ask for this
type of information.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(h) Data Integrity.</span></b></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey will collect and use personal
information only as set forth herein or in a manner that is compatible with the
previously described purposes, except where an individual subsequently
authorizes a different use. SurveyMonkey has taken reasonable steps to ensure
that it only collects personal information that is relevant to the
aforementioned intended uses, and that it is accurate, complete, and current.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Choice</span></u></b></p>

<p><b><span>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information
Sharing and Disclosure</span></b></p>

<p><span>We only share Vendor User Personal
Information, Customer User Personal Information, non-identifying information or
Log Data with third parties as described below. SurveyMonkey obtains the
assurances from third parties that they will safeguard personal information
consistently with this Policy by way of contract obligating the agent to
provide at least the same level of protection as is used by SurveyMonkey. Where
SurveyMonkey has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal
information in a manner contrary to this Policy, SurveyMonkey will take commercially
reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. SurveyMonkey may
share Vendor User Personal Information and Customer User Personal Information
with third-party service providers and SurveyMonkey-related entities worldwide
(e.g., its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries and their successors and
assigns) in connection with communications, payments and other aspects of
operating and promoting the Site, Program and Services. We require that these
entities agree to use such information based on our instructions and in
compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality
and security measures. We may, subject to the restrictions in subsection (b) of
the Information Collection and Use section above, also share Customer User
Personal Information with our business partners or other entities so those
entities can provide you with advertising and marketing information on goods or
services that may be of interest to you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Aggregate Information and
Non-Identifying Information</span></b><span>. We may share
aggregated non-identifying information and Log Data that does not include
Vendor User Personal Information or Customer User Personal Information, and we
may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data with third
parties (including media, suppliers, research companies and other
organizations) for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes.
Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain Vendor
User Personal Information or Customer User Personal Information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, SurveyMonkey may identify Vendors (and Vendor Product
names) in various SurveyMonkey presentations, on the Site, and in SurveyMonkey
marketing materials, customer lists and financial reports, which may or may not
be associated with aggregated non-identifying information and Log Data.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Compliance with Laws and Law
Enforcement.</span></b><span> SurveyMonkey cooperates with
government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and
comply with the laws applicable to it. Where we are legally obliged to do so,
we may disclose information about you to government or law enforcement
officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary
or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not
limited to subpoenas, warrants or requests under any mutual legal assistance
treaties), to protect the property and rights of SurveyMonkey or a third party,
to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop
activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal,
unethical or legally actionable activity.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Business Transfers.</span></b><span> SurveyMonkey may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of
its assets, including Vendor User Personal Information and Customer User
Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization
or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Service Providers.</span></b><span> We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate
our Sites and Services, to provide the Sites and Services on our behalf, to
perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, bill or credit card
payment processing, maintenance services, database management, web analytics
and improvement of the Sites' features) or to assist us in analyzing how our
Sites and Services are used. These third parties have access to Vendor User
Personal Information, Customer User Personal Information, non-identifying
information and Log Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</span></p>

<p><span>Individuals may choose to indicate that
they do not wish for us to provide their personal information to a non-agent
third party at the time the information is collected by us, by deleting or
changing the information as described below or by making such a request to the
privacy officer at the contact information listed below. Individuals will also
have the opportunity to opt out of any transfer to a non-agent third party if
the new entity's planned processing of your Vendor User Personal Information or
Customer User Personal Information (as applicable) differs materially from that
set forth in this Privacy Policy or for a purpose other than the purpose for
which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing
or Deleting Your Information</span></b></p>

<p><span>All registered users of our Site, Program
and Services may review, update, correct or delete the personal information in
their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such
information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to
delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to
accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the
record. See below for privacy contact information. From time to time, we may
contact you by mail, email or telephone to tell you about additional products
or services that we or third parties may offer. If you do not wish to receive
such calls or promotional materials, please contact us and we will attempt to
accommodate your request.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data
Security</span></b></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey is concerned with safeguarding
your information. We employ a variety of industry-standard administrative,
physical and electronic security measures designed to protect your information
from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any
breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted
electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable legislation
or statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or (as permitted
by law) conspicuous posting on the Site in the most expedient time possible and
without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs
of law enforcement; (ii) our legal obligations; or (ii) any measures necessary
to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of
the data system.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International
Transfers</span></b></p>

<p><span>Your information may be transferred to
— and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may
not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. With regard to such
transfers and maintenance, SurveyMonkey complies with the U.S.-EU and
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth herein and consistent with it
Safe Harbor commitments. For more information about the Safe Harbor Program and
to review SurveyMonkey's certification, please visit the U.S. Department of
Commerce's Website (http://export.gov/safeharbor/). You have consented to your
personal data being transferred out of the EU and onto servers located in the
United States. These servers are maintained by our U.S. company, SurveyMonkey
Inc., which is certified under the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss
Safe Harbor Framework. This means that we meet certain general EU requirements
relating to the provision of adequate data privacy.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enforcement</span></b></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey uses a self-audit to assure
its compliance with this Privacy Policy and periodically audits its operations
to ensure they are in compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor
Frameworks and that this Privacy Policy is accurate. Should you have any
concerns, complaints, or disputes related to SurveyMonkey's compliance with the
U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, please contact our privacy
officer – <a href="mailto:privacy@techvalidate.com">privacy@techvalidate.com</a>
or by &nbsp;using the contact information listed below and we will investigate
and attempt to resolve your concerns or issues. If the matter cannot be
resolved through our internal process, we agree to dispute resolution using the
American Arbitration Association as a third party resolution provider. Their
contact information can be found at www.adr.org.</span></p>

to Other Sites</span></b></p>

<p><span>Our Site contains links to other websites.
If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or
other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be
directed to that third party's website. The fact that the Site permits you to
link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not
an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that
third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security
policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites.
These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites
follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal
information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies
or statements of the other websites you visit.</span></p>

<p><b><span>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
Policy Towards Children</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Site and use of the Program and
Services are not directed to children under eighteen (18). We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under thirteen (13)
through the Site, Program or Services. If a parent or guardian becomes aware
that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their
consent, he or she should contact us electronically at privacy@techvalidate.com.&nbsp;
If we become aware that a child under thirteen (13) has provided us with
personal information through the Site, Program or Services we will delete such

surveys hosted by SurveyMonkey, we collect, on behalf and upon instructions
(including the ones provided in this privacy policy) of Vendors and Vendor
Users, information relating to you and your use of the services. For further
information on how the Vendor collects and uses your information you should
contact the Vendor. SurveyMonkey will only independently collect or process any

<p><b><span>Enforcement</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>(a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span>Limitations to this Privacy Policy</span></b></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey may be limited in its
adherence to this Privacy Policy (a) to the extent required to respond to a
legal or ethical obligation; (b) to the extent necessary to meet national
security, public interest or law enforcement obligations; and (c) to the extent

<p><b><span>(b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b><span>&nbsp;Additional information for European Union users</span></b></p>

<p><span>SurveyMonkey provides some of its services
to users in the EU through SurveyMonkey Europe, located at 2 Shelbourne
Buildings, Second Floor, Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4, Ireland.</span></p>

<p><b><span>"Personal data".</span></b><span> For users located in the EU, references to "personal information"
in this policy are equivalent to what is commonly referred to as "personal
data" in the EU.</span></p>

<p><b><span>About IP addresses.</span></b><span> Our servers record the incoming IP addresses of visitors to our
websites (whether or not the visitor is a SurveyMonkey customer) and store the
IP addresses in log files. We use these log files for purposes such as system
administration and maintenance, record keeping, tracking referring web sites,
inferring your location, and security purposes (e.g. controlling abuse, spam
and DDOS attacks). We also store IP addresses along with certain actions you
take on our system. IP addresses are only linked to survey responses if a
survey creator has configured a survey to collect IP addresses. By agreeing to
this privacy policy, you expressly consent to SurveyMonkey using your IP
address for the foregoing purposes. If you wish to opt out from the foregoing
consent to use your IP address, you must cancel your contract (if you have one)
or not respond to a questionnaire if requested to do so.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Data controller.</span></b><span> SurveyMonkey Europe, whose contact information is listed above, is
the data controller for registration, billing and other account information
that we collect from Vendors in the EU. However, the data controller for Customer
User data is the Vendor. The Vendor determines how their Customer User data is
used and disclosed. SurveyMonkey only processes such data in accordance with a
Vendor's instructions and permissions (including those given under this privacy
policy) selected by the Vendor when they create and administer their account.</span></p>

personal information that SurveyMonkey holds about you. This right may be
exercised by contacting customer support.</span></p>

disclosure and processing of your personal data in the manner described in this
privacy policy, including our procedures relating to cookies, IP addresses and

which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of
protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area. Your consent
is voluntary, and you may revoke your consent by opting out at any time. Please
