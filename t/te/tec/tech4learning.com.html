        </b>As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without
        providing any personal information. In connection with other activities,
        such as subscribing to the collaboration services offered on the Site or
        utilizing online software applications, Tech4Learning may ask you to
        provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting
        an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these
        activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however,
        Tech4Learning may ask that you provide us personal information, such as
        your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail
        address, employer, job title and department, telephone and fax numbers,
        and other personal information.<br>
        <br>
        When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to
        provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the
        information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and
        some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect
        to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that
        activity.<br>
        <br>
        When you use the Site, Tech4Learning or third parties authorized by
        Tech4Learning may also collect certain technical and routing information
        about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services.
        For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type,
        operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of
        your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and
        track your use of the Site and its services. Tech4Learning also uses
        such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site.
        Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do
        not match such information with any of your personal information.<br>
        <br>
        When you submit personal information to Tech4Learning through this Site,

        national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the
        countries in which Tech4Learning and its affiliates and subsidiaries
        maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You
        also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain
        activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of
        your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Tech4Learning.
        Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information
        for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.<br>

        Tech4Learning has established relationships with various service
        providers whose services are available to you from this Site or from Web
        sites that are linked to this Site. Typically, these providers offer
        services that Tech4Learning customers might find useful, such as those
        that can be used in conjunction with Tech4Learning services and
        products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide
        personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the
        contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a
        provider's Web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such
        site, and personal information that you provide while on this Site in
        conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy
        Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service
        providers often provide that they will share with Tech4Learning personal
        information collected from you. In such instances, Tech4Learning may use
        this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.<o:p>
