  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>TECHOPEDIA.COM IS COMMITTED TO YOUR PRIVACY. TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE, THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW
    AND WHEN WE SHARE IT, PLEASE READ THE PRIVACY POLICY BELOW. PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND ALL
    SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH THE SITE. </p>
  <p>This policy covers how Techopedia.com treats personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your past use
    of our products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, email
    address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. </p>
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>Techopedia.com collects personal information when you register with Techopedia.com, when you use the site and services offered on the site,
    when you visit pages on the site or the pages of certain partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Techopedia.com may also combine
    information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. </p>
  <p>Techopedia.com uses such information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests
    for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.
    When you register we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal code and company demographics of
    the company you work for. When you register with Techopedia.com and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. </p>
  <p>Techopedia.com collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your
    use of the products and services that we offer. Techopedia.com automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,
    including your IP address, Techopedia.com cookie information, and the pages you request. </p>
  <h2>Information Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
  <p>Techopedia.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide
    products or services you request, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: </p>
  We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of Techopedia.com under confidentiality agreements to provide services in
  support of the site. These companies may use your personal information to help Techopedia.com communicate with you about offers from Techopedia.com.
  However, these companies do not have any independent right to use or share this information. We may sometimes share aggregate non-personal information
  with third parties about how our users utilize the site and services. This aggregate information is typically in the form of statistics, such
  as numbers of Techopedia.com users who live in a particular locale or fall within a particular age group. Such aggregate information is gathered
  from individual Techopedia.com users’ information but is not traceable to any specific identifiable Techopedia.com user. Techopedia.com may
  share personal information with third parties to the extent required to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish
  or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Techopedia.com may also share personal information in order to investigate, prevent,
  or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
  of the Techopedia.com Terms of Service, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
  <p>If Techopedia.com is acquired by or merged with or into another company, we will provide public notice before personal information is transferred
    and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
  <p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make
    an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. </p>
  <h2>Use of Personal Information with Tell-A-Friend Features</h2>
  <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will
    automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Techopedia.com does not store this information. It is
    used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. </p>
  <h2>Use of Personal Information with Marketing Partners and Co-Registration</h2>
  <p>In instances where Techopedia.com and a marketing partner are offering a special value (i.e., a free offering) to our users, we may share
    your personal information with such partners By signing up to receive items through these promotions, you are expressly consenting to Techopedia.com
    sharing your personal information (“co-registration”) with such partners and you will become subject to their privacy policies, which may vary
    from those of Techopedia.com. In the event that you would like to opt-out of receiving offers from these partners, you must do so directly with
    them. If you have any problems contacting one of our partners, <a href="/about/contact.aspx">contact us</a> and we will help you resolve the
    situation. </p>
  <p>In addition, you are expressly consenting to Techopedia.com that the use of certain personally identifiable User data may be processed and 
    shared between applicable third party social network and/or identity providers. User accounts with such third party Providers shall be 
    subject to such third party Providers' then-current terms of use and privacy policies ("Third Party Policies") and Techopedia.com shall 
    not be responsible for any violation of their Policies.&nbsp; You are allowing Techopedia.com to user and store certain of this user data 
    for its own business purposes.</p>
  <h2>Newsletters and Alerts</h2>
  <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s) or alert system, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter or alert to
    you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, alerts and promotional
    communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by <a href="/about/contact.aspx">
      contacting us</a>. We also offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on your <span class="ital">Edit Profile</span> page.
  </p>
  <h2>Use of Personal Information Posted on Forums</h2>
  <p>If you use a forum on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected,
    or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable
    information you choose to submit in these forums. </p>
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Techopedia.com, like many websites, uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing a string of code text that we transfer to your computer’s hard
    drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox)
    to connect to Techopedia.com, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Techopedia.com to present you with custom web pages and options.
    For example, instead of seeing a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your site username on it and information about products
    or services that reflect your interests. </p>
  <p>You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of
    Techopedia.com features and are required for the use of the Site. We hope you will leave them turned on. </p>
  <p>In addition to our cookies, Techopedia.com may allow third parties that show advertisements on our site or participate in co-registration to
    set and access their own cookies on your computer. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by Techopedia.com Privacy Policy,
    but rather by the policies of those third parties. However, these third parties do not have access to Techopedia.com cookies. </p>
  <p>Techopedia.com also uses Web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to allow us to count how many people have visited a certain
    page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Techopedia.com website. Additionally, we sometimes
    use Web beacons to access Techopedia.com cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Techopedia.com products and services.
    A Web beacon is a transparent image placed on a Web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity
    and effectiveness of the material posted on the Techopedia.com web site. We may also use Web beacons in connection with emails sent to Techopedia.com
    users to let us know whether and when the email was opened. </p>
  <p>We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. </p>
  <h2>Third-Party Ad Serving</h2>
  <p>We send to your Web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of websites. However, we also allow other companies,
    called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our Web pages. Because your Web browser must request these advertising
    banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a Web page
    from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond
    to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience it is trying to reach. As always remember,
    we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers
    do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. </p>
  <p>We also use third-party ad servers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits
    to Techopedia.com, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web
    sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a Web beacon or pixel tag,
    which is industry standard technology, used by most major websites. </p>
  <h2>Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers</h2>
  <p>If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must visit each ad network's website
    individually and opt out. </p>
  <h2>Editing and/or Deleting Account Information and Preferences</h2>
  <p>You can edit the information contained in your account at any time by clicking on MY ACCOUNT after logging on to Techopedia.com. You can delete
    your Techopedia.com account by visiting the ACCOUNT SETTINGS page within your account. Although you account will be deactivated immediately,
    information provided to us while you were a registered user may remain in back-up storage on our servers indefinitely. Nevertheless, once you
    delete your account, this information will be inaccessible to the public. </p>
  <h2>Confidentiality and Security</h2>
  <p>Techopedia.com limits access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably needs such information to provide products
    or services to you or in order to do their jobs. In addition, Techopedia.com maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that
    comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. </p>
  <p>Although Techopedia.com takes your privacy seriously and will take reasonable and customary measures to protect it, we cannot guarantee that
    there will be no unauthorized use of your personal information. </p>
  <p>If you register for the site and services and create a User Account, you will be provided a username and password for such User Account. You
    acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password as well as any and all activity that occur under your
    User Account and password. You agree that at the end of each session using the Site and Services, you will exit your User Account. In the event
    of any unauthorized use of your password and/or User Account, you agree that you will immediately notify Techopedia.com by sending an email
    to webmaster@techopedia.com. Techopedia.com cannot and will not be liable for any and all losses or damages arising from your failure to comply
    with this Section. </p>
  <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
  <p>From time to time, Techopedia.com may make available to you certain services offered by third parties or may include links to sites operated
    and controlled by third parties. Those third-party services and sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. Users who choose to visit those
    third-party sites are advised to review their privacy policies. </p>
  <h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>
  <p>If at any time you would like to review the personal information we collect about you, just ask. You should send an email to webmaster@techopedia.com
    from the email account you used to create your account and we will provide you with a summary, as well as an opportunity to correct and update
    this information. </p>

    address specified in your Techopedia.com account or by placing a prominent notice on our site. </p>
