							<p><strong>COOKIES AND TRAFFIC DATA</strong></p>
							<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the website. Tecademics uses cookies to customize your experience on the Website to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same informational messages repeatedly, and to store your username so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website.

							<p>You may disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website.</p>
							<p>We may also allow third party service providers to use cookies and other technologies to collect information and to track browsing activity over time and across third party websites such as web browsers used to read our websites, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our websites, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.</p>
							<p>We may use analytics companies to gather information and aggregate data from our website visitors such as which pages are visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on our websites.

							</p>
							<p><strong>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
							<p>This Website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this Website or to request certain services or information. Personal Information that is collected from customers, independent contractors and registered customers through Customer Registration, Product or Services Purchases, and/or Surveys is used and disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, Tecademics DOES NOT share personal information. Tecademics may share aggregated information from time to time with its partners, vendors or other third parties. When such aggregate information is shared by Tecademics, no personal information is shared. We may use personal information for a number of purposes such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>To respond to an email or particular request from you.</li>
								<li>To personalize the website for you.</li>
								<li>To process an application as requested by you.</li>
								<li>To administer surveys and promotions.</li>
								<li>To provide you with information that we believe may be useful to you, such as information about health products or services provided by us or other businesses.</li>
								<li>To perform analytics and to improve our products, websites, and advertising.</li>
								<li>To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal process.</li>
								<li>To protect someone’s health, safety, or welfare. 08.11.2016 Tecademics Privacy Policy Page 4</li>
								<li>To protect our rights, the rights of affiliates or related third parties, or take appropriate legal action, such as to enforce our Terms of Use.</li>
								<li>To keep a record of our transactions and communications.</li>
								<li>As otherwise necessary or useful for us to conduct our business, so long as such use is permitted by law.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We may supplement the personal information you provide with additional personal information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to Tecademics. You are under no obligation to provide personal information, with the caveat that your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain of the features and services available on the Website or from purchasing any of our products.</p>
							<p><strong>INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND CUSTOMER REGISTRATION</strong></p>
							<p>In order to become an independent contractor, an applicant must provide certain personal information to us. We also may require an applicant’s Social Security Number or Federal Tax ID Number so that we may prepare and file necessary non-employee compensation forms for the IRS. Certain customers may be required to register in order to purchase products directly from us. Registered customers will be required to provide personal information. We use this information to maintain contact with independent contractors and registered customers, and to process independent contractor and registered customer orders.</p>
							<p><strong>PRODUCT OR SERVICE PURCHASES</strong></p>
							<p>When a customer, registered customer, or independent contractor purchases products or services from us through any of our websites, the purchaser must provide us with certain personal information. This information is used for billing and payment purposes and to fill orders.</p>
							<p><strong>INFORMATION THAT YOU MAKE PUBLIC</strong></p>
							<p>The Website may contains features (e.g., public profiles, forums, and message boards) that permit you to upload, post, transmit, display, perform or distribute content, information or other material, including some of your personal information. Any information that you choose to disclose by means of such features becomes public information over which Tecademics is unable to exercise any control. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information by any means and you agree to assume all responsibility for doing so.</p>
							<p><strong>INFORMATION USE AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES</strong></p>
							<p>Tecademics analyzes Traffic Data and information gathered using cookies to help Tecademics better understand who is using the Website and how they are using it. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Tecademics is able to better design the Website to improve your experience, and to serve you more relevant and interesting content. From time to time, Tecademics may release Traffic Data and information gathered using cookies in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. Tecademics does not attempt to link information gathered using Cookies to personal information.</p>
							<p><strong>SHARING INFORMATION</strong></p>
							<p>Except under the following circumstances and otherwise as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Tecademics will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this policy and as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
							<p>We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction.</p>
							<p>We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other visitors.</p>
							<p>If you submit information or a posting to a chat room, bulletin board, or similar “chat” related portion of this Website, the information you submit along with your screen name will be visible to all visitors, and such visitors may share with others. Therefore, please be thoughtful in what you write and understand that this information may become public.</p>
							<p>We may also share personal information with other third party companies that we collaborate with or hire to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage email, and we might provide the company with your email address and certain other information in order for them to send you an email message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire companies to host or operate some of our Websites and related computers and software applications.</p>
							<p>Tecademics discloses personal information to those who help it provide services, including those who perform technical, administrative and data processing tasks such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, and data storage and security, when required by law or to protect rights. Tecademics discloses personal information in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Tecademics believes in its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tecademics.</p>
							<p>When legally required by law enforcement, judicial and administrative agency disclosures, Tecademics will provide confidential and personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with judicial and administrative orders, subpoenas, civil or criminal investigative demands, administrative and regulatory demands and other legal obligations. In order for Tecademics to conduct business in certain jurisdictions, Tecademics must disclose certain personally identifiable and confidential information to regulatory authorities in such jurisdictions. Such information may include, but is not limited to, income information and personally identifiable information.</p>
							<p>Tecademics reserves the right to transfer all personal information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Tecademics’ assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred personal information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it.</p>
							<p>Personal information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by Tecademics’ successor organization, if any.</p>
							<p>If you have failed to pay any balance owed in consideration of products or services, Tecademics may, as permitted by law, report your personal information, including without limitation, your unpaid balance, to consumer credit reporting services, collection agencies and others.</p>
							<p>Tecademics occasionally may assign prospective sales and new independent contractors leads to independent contractors. In these cases, Tecademics will provide the lead with the appropriate independent contractors name and contact information. In addition, Tecademics may have an Independent Contractor Locator feature on its Website. Pursuant to this feature, a prospective customer or new independent contractor can locate a nearby Tecademics independent contractor. In order to make the Independent Contractor Locator feature and the lead assignments effective, the Company will provide the prospective customer or new independent contractor with the independent contractor’s name and contact information, which may include his/her telephone number, address, and/or email address.</p>
							<p>To help independent contractors in Tecademics’ affiliate marketing program manage their independent businesses, we may provide your sponsor and other up-line independent contractors with your name, address, telephone number, and email address, as well as data relating to your sales and recruitment activity through the back office to the Website.</p>
							<p><strong>COMMUNICATIONS FROM US</strong></p>
							<p>When enrolling as an independent contractor, registering as registered customer, or making a purchase or other inquiry through the Website, you consent to receive periodic email and other communications from us and from Tecademics independent contractors. For example, Tecademics sends all new independent contractors and registered customers a welcoming email to verify password, username, and acceptance of the Independent Contractor’s Agreement or Customer Agreement. All independent contractors and registered customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Customers who have not registered with Tecademics and who grant permission will also receive occasional information on products, services, special deals, and the like.</p>
							<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send independent contractors or customers an email. Generally, independent contractors may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their accounts. These communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
							<p>Tecademics communicates with independent contractors and registered customers via email, regular mail and telephone on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their Tecademics business. Tecademics communicates with other customers with respect to products or services purchased by such customers from Tecademics. Such communications may be by email, regular mail or telephone.</p>
							<p><strong>LINKS</strong></p>
							<p>Tecademics Websites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Tecademics is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Tecademics Websites.</p>
							<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
							<p>Tecademics has implemented and maintains reasonable security procedures and practices to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your personal information.</p>
							<p><strong>LOST OR STOLEN INFORMATION</strong></p>
							<p>You must promptly notify us if your credit, banking, other financial information, user name or password is lost, stolen or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, bank account information, other financial institution information, user name or password from your account.</p>
							<p><strong>PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
							<p>From time to time, Tecademics may conduct contests, giveaways and other promotions (collectively, “Promotional Activities”). Any information submitted in connection with Promotional Activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p>From time to time, Tecademics may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help Tecademics improve the Websites, its products, services, or the Tecademics affiliate marketing program. Any personal information provided to Tecademics in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy only in aggregated form.</p>
							<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
							<p>Tecademics reserves the right to amend or change this Privacy Policy at any time at its sole discretion. It is your responsibility to periodically access this Privacy Policy by clicking on the Privacy Policy link at our Website. You can determine the date this Privacy Policy was last updated by referring to the effective date found at the end of the policy. When material changes or amendments are made to the Privacy Policy, we will announce the same at our home page for a period of 3 days following implementation of the amended Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p><strong>MAKING CHANGES TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
