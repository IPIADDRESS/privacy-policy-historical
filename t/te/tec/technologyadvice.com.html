BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
<h4>Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>Bell Holdings, LLC dba TechnologyAdvice (“TechnologyAdvice”) Is committed to safeguarding Your privacy online. This privacy policy applies to Your information that TechnologyAdvice collects and receives. By using this website, technologyadvice.com (“Website”), You agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please read the following policy to understand how Your Personal Information will be treated as You use TechnologyAdvice’s Services. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as defined in TechnologyAdvice’s Terms of Use.</p>
<h4>Personal Information Defined</h4>
<p>For this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that is personally identifiable such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with a User. TechnologyAdvice collects and uses Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services.</p>
<h4>Browsing the Website</h4>
<p>If You browse through the Website without entering any Personal Information, TechnologyAdvice will automatically gather and store certain information about Your visit. This information does not identify You personally and cannot be linked back to You unless You decide at some point to identify Yourself. If You are only browsing, TechnologyAdvice may collect the following information (whenever possible): IP address, domain name, the type of browser and operating system used to access the Website, the date and time You access the Website, the pages You visit (click-through), and if You linked to the Website from another website, the address of that website as well as additional information related to Your visit. TechnologyAdvice uses Your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Website.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>TechnologyAdvice may place “cookies” on Your personal computer. “Cookies” are small identifiers sent from a web server and stored on Your computer’s hard drive, similar to a license plate, that help TechnologyAdvice to recognize You if You visit the Website again. TechnologyAdvice use cookies to record session information, such as record user-specific information on what pages You access or visit, record past activity in order to provide better service when You return to the Website, ensure that You are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, to customize Website content based on Your browser type, and to track how You found the Website. Cookies are not designed to be used to get data from Your hard drive, Your e-mail or any other personal data about You. To protect Your privacy, TechnologyAdvice does not use cookies to store or transmit any Personal Information about You on the Internet. You can reject cookies by changing Your browser settings. Please note, however, that if You reject our cookies, it is possible that some web pages may not properly load, Your access to certain information might be denied or You might have to enter information about Yourself more than once.</p>
<h4>Personal Information TechnologyAdvice Collects</h4>
<p>TechnologyAdvice collects the following Personal Information that You submit voluntarily. Creating an Account requires You to provide TechnologyAdvice with Your name, e-mail address, products used, projects, and password of Your choice. After registering You may provide TechnologyAdvice with additional information about You as You use the Services such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical addresses</li>
<li>telephone numbers</li>
<li>information regarding Your business (e.g., business name, revenue thresholds, etc.)</li>
<li>information regarding Your business needs and software requirements</li>
<li>other personally identifiable information You affirmatively provide to us</li>
</ul>
<p>When You contribute posts and reviews, participate in TechnologyAdvice surveys (either directly, or through third party service providers), or provide any other Content to the Services through other means, TechnologyAdvice will collect all the information You provide. If You exchange messages with others through the Website, TechnologyAdvice may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow You to manage them. In connection with reviews, posts, and surveys, TechnologyAdvice (and/or its third party service providers) may collect a wide variety of product- and vendor-related information on an optional basis. Please be aware that while some pieces of information that You provide to TechnologyAdvice would not be sufficient to identify You when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that You have provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other Users to identify You.</p>
<p>When You contact TechnologyAdvice by sending TechnologyAdvice an e-mail or when You use any of our contact forms, TechnologyAdvice will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) Your e-mail, text message, or that You enter into such forms.</p>
<h4>Minors</h4>
<p>TechnologyAdvice does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information by anyone under the age of 13. Do not sign up for an Account if You are under the age of 13 and do not provide TechnologyAdvice with any information regarding any individual under the age of 13.</p>
<h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>
<p>Personal Information You submit to TechnologyAdvice, or to third parties that support us in collecting information, is used by us to provide You and other Users with the Services, to respond to requests that You make, to improve our Services, and to operate, maintain, and improve the features, functionality, performance, and support of the Services.</p>
<h4>TechnologyAdvice uses the Personal Information that it gathers about You for the following purposes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>To provide our Services to You, to communicate with You about Your use of the Services, to respond to Your inquiries, to fulfill Your orders, and for other customer service purposes, which may include communicating with You via email</li>
<li>To tailor the content and information that TechnologyAdvice may send or display to You, personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize Your experiences while using the Website or the Services</li>
<li>For customer loyalty programs</li>
<li>To share with website affiliates, and/or vendors of products you have expressed interest in as a means of establishing communication between both you and such vendors or affiliates.</li>
<li>For marketing and promotional purposes. For example, TechnologyAdvice may use Your information, such as Your email address, to send You news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact You about products or information TechnologyAdvice thinks may interest You. TechnologyAdvice also may use the information that TechnologyAdvice learns about You to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites.</li>
<li>To better understand how users access and use the Website and Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, to improve the Website and Services and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Public Postings</h4>
<p>One of the purposes of the Services is for Users to share product- and vendor-related information with other Users. Therefore, You should assume that any information (including any Personal Information You may choose to provide, but excluding Your registration information) that You post will be made available to other Users of the Services. TechnologyAdvice may provide You the ability to anonymously post certain comments, in which case TechnologyAdvice will not include Your contact information (i.e., name, username, email address, or postal address) on the Website in connection with such comments. However, You should know that TechnologyAdvice’s internal records may associate Your contact information with such comments.</p>

TechnologyAdvice will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>
<p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, TechnologyAdvice does not disclose to or share Your Personal Information with third parties, unless You ask or authorize TechnologyAdvice to do so. TechnologyAdvice may provide Your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on behalf of or with TechnologyAdvice to provide You with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate with Users. However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this information except to help TechnologyAdvice provide the Services. TechnologyAdvice may share some or all of Your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case TechnologyAdvice will require Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Mergers</h4>
<p>In the event TechnologyAdvice goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of TechnologyAdvice or its assets may continue to use Your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Legal Obligation to Disclose</h4>
<p>TechnologyAdvice may (and You authorize us to) disclose information TechnologyAdvice has collected from and about You (including Personal Information) if TechnologyAdvice believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) to enforce our TechnologyAdvice Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our Services, or third parties.</p>
<h4>Changing Personal Information</h4>
<p>You may change Your Personal Information (i.e., email address) by logging into Your Account and editing Your Account information. You may also request that Your Account be terminated and that Your Personal Information be deleted by sending an email to hello@technologyadvice.com. Any termination of Your account may involve deletion of Your Account information from TechnologyAdvice’s live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account in the Services. TechnologyAdvice will not have any liability whatsoever to You for any termination of Your account or related deletion of You information.</p>
