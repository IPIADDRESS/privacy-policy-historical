</b><p>At TechOnLine, our customers are our most treasured asset. That's why we make providing a safe and secure purchase environment our top priority. We recognize the importance of protecting credit-card transactions online. While we are confident that transactions on our site are secure, we are aware that you may have concerns about purchasing electronic components and computer parts online. To ensure that every transaction is safe, TechOnLine uses the most advanced encryption technology available. </p>
</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">By making your purchase on our secure server, you are protected by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Our secure server software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It uses powerful encryption technology to protect your credit card information while it travels over the web. The Web Site employs </font><a href="http://www.VeriSign.com/"><font face="Arial" size="2">VeriSign technology</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">, the industry standard encryption technology, to help ensure your information does not get into the wrong hands. </font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>This technology allows us to use the most advanced encryption tools necessary to protect the information transmitted between your computer and our server. Through encryption, the personal information you enter is converted into code that is then securely dispatched over the Internet. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online—for example, via message boards or chat—that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While TechOnLine strives to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with our users and members is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be absolutely guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally-identifiable information, TechOnLine can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. </p>
<p>Your account on the Web Site is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. TechOnLine will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign out of your account on the Web Site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café. </p>
