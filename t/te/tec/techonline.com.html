<h2>CMP PRIVACY STATEMENT </h2>
<p><i>Last Updated: 
<!-- #BeginDate format:Am1 -->October 3, 2006<!-- #EndDate -->
</i></p>
<p>CMP MEDIA LLC and its affiliates CME LLC, CMP HEALTHCARE MEDIA LLC, CMP HEALTHCARE MEDIA GROUP LLC , Shorecliff Holdings LLC, and CMP-Cybermedia LLC (collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as "we" or "CMP") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites, subscribers to our magazines, registrants for our events, recipients of our e-mail newsletters and all other customers of our products and services. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our customers' right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our customers. This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for all products and services owned by CMP. A current list of our publications, web sites, online webcasts, newsletters and trade shows can be found at <a href="http://www.cmp.com.com/">http://www.cmp.com/</a>.</p>
<p> <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong><br>
CMP collects
information from our website users, subscribers
and other customers. In this section of our
Privacy Statement, we describe the type of
information we collect and how we use it
to provide better services to our customers.</p>
<p> <strong>Registration and Ordering</strong> <br>When attending our trade shows and other in-person events, participating in our customer-sponsored webcasts, using some of our websites and signing up for certain selected services (such as free subscriptions), users must first register. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to provide a more personalized experience on our sites. We also may collect information about a user's professional responsibilities (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, company information and professional certification). We use such information to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or for industry reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Many of our products and services are free
to subscribers who meet certain demographic
criteria. Independent auditors may need to
certify the eligibility of these subscribers.
In order to do that, we may collect unique
identifiers (such as mother's maiden name)
that we disclose to the auditors strictly for
industry reporting and audit verification purposes.
</p>
<p>For our services that require payment (such
as certain events, products and subscriptions),
we also collect credit card information (such
as account name, number and expiration date),
which is used for our or our agent's billing
purposes only, and is not otherwise shared.
</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Newsletters</strong> <br>If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact information (such as name, e-mail address, phone number) and information about the subscriber's professional interests and responsibilities. We use this information in the same manner as we use contact information in the registration and ordering process described above. Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter.</p><p><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong><br>
From time to time we invite web site users and other customers to provide
information via surveys or contests. Participation
in these surveys or contests is completely
voluntary and the website user or other customer
therefore has a choice whether to disclose
requested contact information (such as name
and mailing address) and demographic information
(such as zip code or job title). In addition
to the other uses set forth in this policy,
contact information collected in connection
with surveys and contests is used to notify
the winners and award prizes and to monitor
or improve the use of, and satisfaction with
the website or other CMP product or service.
Subject to the given customer's preferences
(as described in the "Permission" section below), such information
also may be shared with third party sponsors
of such surveys or contests.
</p>
<p><strong>Interactive Features</strong> <br>
At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community features such
as discussion boards, webcasts and user profiles.
Note that all personal information sent or
posted via such features becomes public information
for which we are not responsible.
</p>
<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong> <br>
If customers elect to use our referral service
for informing a friend about our sites and
services, we may ask them for the friend's
name, job title and e-mail address. CMP will
store and use this information to send the
friend an invitation. This information may
also be used to provide information about
our company and related products and services.
The friend may contact us as specified in
the tell-a-friend message to request that
no further communications be sent.
</p>
<p> <strong>Communications with Us</strong> <br>
We have features where our customers can submit information to us (such
as our feedback forms). Where such submissions
include requests for service, support
or information, we may forward them to our
agents, as needed, to best respond to the specific
request. In addition, we may retain e-mails
and other information sent to us for our
internal administrative purposes, and to help
us to serve customers better. Please note that
letters to the editor and similar submissions
may be made public. </p>
<p><strong>Communications from Us:
Service Updates, Special Offers</strong> <br>
In order to
best serve our customers, we may send updates
that contain important information about our
products and services. For example, we send
new members a welcoming message, and verify
password and username for our password-protected
web sites. We may also communicate with a customer
to provide requested services and for account-related
issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail.
In addition to such service and product-essential
messages, we offer our customers the option
to receive information about our company,
related products, services and special deals.
Users, however, can choose not to receive these
communications from us, as set forth in the "Permission" section below. 
</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Data Collection
</strong><br>
Our web sites, newsletters and, from time to time, certain other
products and services have features that automatically
collect information from customers, to deliver
content specific to customers' interests and
to honor their preferences. This information
assists us in creating products and services
that will serve the needs of our customers.
</p>
<p>For example, we use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive
containing information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring
login only once, thereby saving time while on our web site. If users reject the
cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our web site. For example,
the user may not be able to participate in sweepstakes, contests or drawings.
Additionally, we may note some of the pages the user visits on our web sites
and via our email newsletters through the use of pixel tags (also called clear
gifs) and web beacons. The use of cookies, pixels and web beacons enable us to
track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
sites and via our email newsletters.
</p>
<p>In addition, some of our business affiliates
use cookies on our web sites and in our email
newsletters, in ads or promotions. However,
we have no access to or control over these
business affiliates' cookies; we urge users
to read their privacy policies for information.
In particular, we use third-party advertising technology to serve ads for CMP products and services when you visit certain CMP Web sites. This technology uses information about your visits to these CMP Web sites (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising for CMP products and services. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits these sites and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web sites. The information used in this process is not personally identifiable. To learn more about our third party ad serving partner, cookies, and how to "opt-out," please {<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>}.</p>
<p> We also use an email delivery and marketing
company to send emails (including newsletters)
for which you have registered (or otherwise
agreed to receive). Web beacons and cookies
may be used in such email messages to help
us measure the effectiveness of our advertising
and how customers use our web sites and other
products and services. </p>
<p>For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of all visitors to our web sites. We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration, and to gather broad information about our user base.</p>
<p>We may combine information supplied by a customer at registration with web site usage data to learn more about users and their preferences in the content of the site. We may use this information to tailor services to your interests or to contact you about offers from our business associates which may be of interest to you. We do not disclose this information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>WITH WHOM
YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong> <br>Other than with respect to users of Techonline.com and related sites, when we have co-branded, customized, private label, "powered by" or sponsored products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific services (however we do not share credit card information with such third parties), then we may share (provide and receive) information about our customers with such third party, subject to the customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section below).&nbsp;Other than with respect to users of Techonline and related sites, in particular, please note that information collected in connection with online webcasts, such as at <a href="http://www.netseminar.com/">www.netseminar.com</a>, will be shared with the sponsor of the particular webcast(s)/seminar(s), subject to the given customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission" section below).</p>
                                <p>These sponsors will use the information according to their own privacy policies,
                                  and we urge participants to read those policies and be aware of their privacy
                                  practices before registering. </p>
                                <p>If you register for the Techonline network of sites, information which you submit at registration may be shared with third party sponsors if you access their white papers and resources or register for events they sponsor.</p>
								<p>Finally, on occasion,
                                  we may provide targeted lists of names and
                                  offline and online contact information for
                                  marketing purposes to third parties, subject
                  to our Permission policies, as described below, pursuant to
                                  which we give customers the option of not having
                                  their name or contact information disclosed
                                  to third parties.
                </p>
								<p>Other than as set forth above, we do not share personally identifiable information with other companies, apart from those acting as our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and confidential. Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, entities into which our company may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal information. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission. We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others.</p>
								<p><strong>CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL
                                    INFORMATION</strong> <br>If  information which you have submitted to us changes, or if you no longer desire our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update your personal data: you may either contact Customer Support for the applicable product or service or, to change your preferences, complete the "Feedback" page as described in the "Permission" section below.</p>
								<p>                                  <strong>PERMISSION</strong>                  <br>
                                  Our customers are given the opportunity to
                                  choose whether to receive information from
                                  our affiliates and us not directly related
                                  to the product or service for which they registered
                                  (or which they otherwise agreed to receive).
                                  Other than the sharing of user information with certain sponsors by Techonline.com and related sites, as set forth in the "With Whom Your Information Is Shared" section above, Customers also have the opportunity to choose whether to have personal information shared with third parties for marketing purposes.                                  Customers also can go to our "Feedback" page at any time, at <a href="http://www.cmp.com/feedback/permission.jhtml">http://www.cmp.com/feedback/permission.jhtml</a> to change their preferences. Please note that we have a number of brands and products. You may choose to opt out of cartain brands and products selectively or for all our lists. Your choice to resubmit your email address and contact details to us will also reset your privacy preferences. In addition, for those customers that are California residents, you may have additional rights, as described in the "Your California Privacy Rights" section below.</p>
                                <p>Please note that we will endeavor to implement
                                  your permission requests within a reasonable
                                  time, although for a time you may continue
                                  to receive mailings, etc., transmitted based
                                  on information released prior to the implementation
                                  of your request. In addition, please note that
                                  even after such request is implemented, you
                                  will continue to receive information directly
                                  related to the product or service for which
                                  you registered (or which you otherwise agreed
                                  to receive), so you always are kept informed.                            </p>

                                </strong>We use reasonable precautions to protect information about our customers while it is stored on our servers or in transit to our vendors processing on our behalf. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

                                    other sites. We encourage our users to be
