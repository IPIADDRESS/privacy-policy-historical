<h3>What this Privacy Statement Covers</h3>
<p>This Privacy Statement covers Technorati’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Technorati gathers when you access Technorati Sites. This Privacy Statement does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties that Technorati does not own or control, or to individuals that Technorati does not control or manage.</p>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

Our registration process requires you to provide Technorati with a valid email address as well as a username and password of your choice. Optional information such as your first and last name, year of birth, zip code, and country of residence helps Technorati have a better understanding of its visitors and members. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of special features offered only to our members.</p>
<h3 id="weblogquickclaim">Weblog Quickclaim</h3>
<p>As a convenience to its members, Technorati provides the option of claiming a weblog by logging into the administrative interface of their blogging (blog publishing) service. Technorati does not store this login information on our service; we only use this data to determine if you have the ability to alter data on the specified blog.</p>
<h3 id="attention">Attention.xml</h3>
<p>Technorati provides its members a feature, which gives people the ability to store and retrieve an Attention.xml file containing personal attention history. Technorati does not share this information with other parties.</p>
