<h2>Technorati Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Privacy Policy Summary</h3>
<p>
Technorati endeavors to maintain and protect personally identifiable 
information about users internally, as spelled out in our privacy policy 
below.  We will only share aggregated statistical information not tied to 
personally identifiable information with partners and vendors, in order to 
improve our internal business processes and serve better information to our 
customers.  Please see our specific agreement with users below.
</p>


<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p>
Technorati is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. We 
will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from 
what is disclosed in this statement. Technorati collects information from its 
users at several different points on its Web site. You can access our Web site 
home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data.
</p>

<p>We automatically log personal data by means such as programming or we link 
information automatically logged by such means with personal data about 
specific individuals. We use cookies to link information stored in cookies with 
personal data about specific individuals. We do so to improve the information 
we present and our other internal business processes.
</p>

<p>We do not collect information about our visitors from other sources, such as 
public records or bodies, or private organizations.
</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>
In order to use the member-only areas of this website, a user must first 
complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give 
their contact information (name and email address) and to create a username &amp; 
password. This information is used to contact the user about the services on 
our site for which they have expressed interest. Technorati does not require 
the user to provide demographic information, such as income level and gender, 
nor unique identifiers such as social security number.
</p>

<h3 id="minors">Minor's Privacy</h3>
<p>
Technorati does not knowingly collect personal data from children as they use 
the site. Users under 18 who join Technocratic will not have their information 
displayed. If you would like us to override this, please 
<a href="mailto:support@technorati.com">contact us</a> 
to obtain parent or guardian approval. Read below for more information on the Online 
Child Protection Act. 
</p>
 
 
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing 
information about the user. Usage of a session cookie is in no way linked to 
any personally identifiable information while on our Web site, unless a member 
is logged into the site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Web site, a 
member user would not have to log in with a password, thereby saving time each 
time they visit our site. Should the user want to temporarily disable this 
function they can do so by clicking the log-out link, at which point the login 
cookie will be deleted. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our 
site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas 
of our site. For example, the user will not be able to view the Members-only 
areas, like their custom watchlists. Cookies can also enable us to track and 
target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site and 
improve our internal business processes.
</p> 
 
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's 
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP 
addresses are linked to personally identifiable information sometimes. 
</p>

  
<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>
We do not share membership information about individuals with anyone, except as 
stated here. Log data is maintained and used for our internal business 
processes, and this information is shared only in aggregate with our partners 
and vendors, or as required by law.
</p>

<p>
If users choose to display their membership information because they have 
claimed a blog, their user name, blog(s), blogroll(s), vCard(s), and/or Friend 
Of A Friend files and member photos will be shown as associated with their blog 
to other users on the site.  Members who do not claim blogs will never have 
their membership information shown or attached to a blog on the external 
website. Any member's information outside of these six kinds of information 
(user name, blog(s), blogroll(s), vCard(s), and/or Friend Of A Friend files and 
member photos), including other information from the membership form or any 
emailed information we receive from members, will not be shared outside the 
company, except as aggregated statistics, or as required by law.  
We do not share any individual user information with any of our business 
partners or outside vendors without permission.  We may share aggregated 
statistics with business partners or outside vendors without permission.
</p>

<p>
We use a billing processing company to bill users for some goods and services. 
These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable 
information for any secondary purposes.  Billing information will be retained 
internally by Technorati as required by law.
</p> 
 
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Technorati, 
Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We 
encourage our users, when they leave our site, to read the privacy statements 
of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. 
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web 
site.
</p>

<h3>Newsletter</h3>
<p>
If a user wishes to subscribe to any of our newsletters, we ask them to 
register by providing their contact information (name and email address) and to 
create a username and password and to opt-in for the newsletter. 
</p>

<h3>Choice/Unsubscribe</h3>
<p>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to having their information 
used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask 
for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so 
users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can 
keep their email address off of our lists. 
</p>

<p>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials 
from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying 
with unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or by emailing us at 
<a href="mailto:remove@technorati.com">remove@technorati.com</a> 
or by contacting 
<a href="mailto:custservice@technorati.com">custservice@technorati.com</a>
. 
</p>

<p>
Users of our Web site are always notified when their information is being 
collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed 
choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an 
outside party.
</p>

<p>
Technorati reserves the right to remove members.  Technorati will notify the 
deleted member through that user's email address of this action, or will make 
best efforts to do so, to explain why this action was taken.
</p>
 
<h3>Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
<p>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this 
information. Information requested may include contact information (such as 
name and contact  address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award 
prizes. Survey information will be used internally for purposes of monitoring 
or improving use of and satisfaction with this Web site. Survey information 
will only be shared outside the company in the form of aggregated statistics.
</p>
  
  
<h3>Special Offers</h3>
<p>
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
services, special deals, and a newsletter if they opt-in to this service. Out 
of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive 
these types of communications. Please see description of our choice/opt-in 
policy below.
</p>
  
  
 
<h3>Site and Service Updates</h3>
<p>
We send the user administrative site and service announcement updates. Members 
are not able to un-subscribe or opt-out from service announcements, which 
contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user 
regarding updates to our site and service and issues relating to their account 
via email (or phone for billing issues).  You cannot unsubscribe from 
administrative service announcements unless you decide to end your membership 
Technorati.
</p>

<h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
<p>
All our employees and data processors, who have access to, and are associated 
with the processing of personal data, are obliged to respect the 
confidentiality of our visitors' personal data.
</p>

<p>
We ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to State institutions 
and authorities except as required by law or other regulation.
</p>

<h3>Correcting/Updating/Removing Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Technorati collects traffic data in logs and this information is maintained 
indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
For members (including those using our developer tools):  if a user's 
personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no 
longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, 
update, or remove that member's personal data.  Information collected for the 
membership process, if requested, will be deleted within 7 days from the 
website.  To notify Technorati of a change, you can go to the 
<a href="/members/index.html">Members section</a> 
or email Customer Support at 
<a href="mailto:support@technorati.com">support@technorati.com</a>
.  However, some personal information may need to be 
maintained if it is connected with billing information or as required by law.
</p>

<p>
Technorati reserves the right to delete members from the site.  Technorati will 
notify the deleted member through that user's email address of this action, or 
will make best efforts to do so, to explain why this action was taken.
</p>
  
<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>
Technorati reserves the right to change this privacy policy.  If we decide to 
change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our 
users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use 
personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at 
the time it was collected, we will notify users by email, with the option to 
opt-in to the new policy within 30 days. Users will have a choice as to whether 
or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use 
information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information 
was collected.
