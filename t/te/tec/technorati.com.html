	      Collection and Use</h3>Sifry Consulting is the sole
	    owner of the information collected on this Web site.  We
	    will not sell, share, or rent this information to others
	    in ways different from what is disclosed in this
	    statement.  Sifry Consulting collects information from its
	    users at several different points on its Web
	    site.<p>
</p></td></tr> 
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><h3>Registration</h3>In order to use
	    the member-only areas of this website, a user must first
	    complete the registration form.  During registration a
	    user is required to give their contact information (name
	    and email address) and to create a username &amp; password.
	    This information is used to contact the user about the
	    services on our site for which they have expressed
	    interest.  Sifry Consulting does not require the user to
	    provide demographic information, such as income level and
	    gender, nor unique identifiers such as social security
	    number.<p> 
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><h3>Order</h3>We request information
	    from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide
	    contact information (i.e., name, telephone and shipping
	    address) and financial information (i.e., credit card
	    number, expiration date).  This information is used for
	    billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we
	    have trouble processing an order, this contact information
	    is used to get in touch with the user.<p>
</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><h3>Cookies</h3>A cookie is a piece of
	    data stored on the user's hard drive containing
	    information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no
	    way linked to any personally identifiable information
	    while on our Web site.  For instance, by setting a cookie
	    on our Web site, the user would not have to log in with a
	    password, thereby saving time each time they visit our
	    site.  Should the user want to temporarily disable this
	    function they can do so by clicking the log-out link.  If
	    a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.
	    The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited
	    in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not
	    be able to view the Members-only areas, like their custom 
	    watchlists. Cookies can also enable
	    us to track and target the interests of our users to
	    enhance the experience on our site.<p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><h3>Log Files</h3>We use IP addresses

	    business requires us to pay royalties based on the sale of
	    each of our audio programs, we must report aggregate sales
	    figures to the publishers with whom we work. However, we
	    do not share any information about individual customers
	    with publishers.<p>We use an outside shipping company to
	      ship orders, and a credit card processing company to
	      bill users for goods and services. These companies do
