<h2 id="cookiepolicy">Cookie policy</h2>
<p class="intro">  Last  updated: Jan. 17, 2017</p>
<p>We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, mobile device IDs and  similar files or technologies to collect and store the information we  automatically collect about your computer, device, and use of [technipfmc.com]  (the “Website”). You can find out more about cookies and how to control them in  the information below.</p>
<p>If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them  using the instructions in this cookies policy, by following the 'opt-out' links  provided below or by changing your browser settings so that cookies from the  Website cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device.</p>
<h3>1. What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information  which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a certain  webpage. Cookies are then sent back to the originating webpage on each  subsequent visit, or to another webpage that recognizes that cookie. Cookies  are widely used in order to make the Website work, or to work more efficiently,  as well as to provide information to the owners of the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate  between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally  improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you  have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also  help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your  interests.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First party cookies,</strong>&nbsp;served directly by  us to your computer or mobile device.</li>
    <li><strong>Third party cookies,</strong>&nbsp;which are served by  a third party on our behalf. We use third party cookies for functionality,  performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different  periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist  only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close  your browser. Other cookies are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive  after your browser is closed. They can be used by the Website to recognize your  computer when you open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>
<h3>2. How do we use cookies?</h3>
<p>We  use cookies to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>track traffic flow and  patterns of travel in connection with the Website;</li>
    <li>understand the total  number of visitors to our Website on an ongoing basis and the types of internet  browsers (e.g. Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer) and operating systems  (e.g. Windows or Mac OS) used by our visitors;</li>
    <li>monitor the performance of  the Website and to continually improve it;</li>
    <li>customize and enhance your  online experience; and</li>
    <li>enable us and third parties  to advertise both on and off this Website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. What types of cookies do we use?</h3>
<p>The types of cookies used by us and our partners in connection with  the Website can be classified into one of five categories, namely 'essential  Website cookies', 'functionality cookies', 'analytics and performance cookies',  'advertising cookies', and ' social media cookies'. We've set out some further  information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third  parties set in the following table.</p>

            <td>
            <p>On some    pages of our Website, third parties that provide applications through our    Website may set their own anonymous cookies in order to track the success of their    applications or customize applications for you. For example, when you share    an article using a social media sharing button on our Website (e.g.,    Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus), the social network that has created the    button will record that you have done this. Because of how cookies work, we    cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in    cookies used by us. Some pages of our Website may also contain embedded    content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their    own cookies.</p>
