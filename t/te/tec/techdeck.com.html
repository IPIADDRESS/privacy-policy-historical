            <p class="text"> <em>SPIN MASTER</em>, Ltd. ("<em>SPIN MASTER</em>" or "<em>TECHDECK.COM</em>"), who owns and operates the website currently located at <a href="http://www.techdeck.com/">www.techdeck.com</a> ("Site"), believes that safeguarding your privacy is serious business.
              Please take a minute to read the following privacy policy ("Policy") so
              that you understand how we treat your personal information. The purpose
              of this Policy is to help you understand what kinds of personally
              identifiable information we may gather about you when you visit the
              Site, how we may use that information, whether we will disclose it and
              how you can correct that information. As we modify and expand our
              services, this Policy might change, so please review it periodically.
              You can tell if the Policy has been modified since you last reviewed it
              by checking the date at the beginning of the Policy. By signing up to
              be a <em>TECHDECK.COM</em> member ("Member") or using the Site or any of <em>TECHDECK.COM's</em> services offered on the Site, you agree to these terms. If you have questions about the Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@techdeck.com">info@techdeck.com</a>. </p>
            <p class="text"> You should be aware that our advertisers or websites that have links on
              our Site may collect personally identifiable information about you. We
              are not responsible for the actions or policies of such websites and
              the Policy does not address the information practices of those websites
              or advertisers. Your use of the Site is governed by our Terms of Use
              and by other published rules pertaining to particular products and
              services offered through the Site. </p>
            <p class="text"> 1. What personally identifying information about me is collected and who collects it? </p>
            <p class="text" personally="" identifying="" means="" name,="" home="" address,="" telephone="" number,="" birthday,="" interests="" any="" that="" tells="" another="" person="" who="" are="" volunteer="" this="" information.="" we="" request="" collect="" services="" site,="" e.g.,="" register="" become="" member.="" information,="" such="" account="" status="" choice="" services,="" is="" created="" maintained="" normal="" course="" providing="" service="" members="" users.="" contribute="" an="" article,="" video="" feature="" order="" for="" us="" credit="" by="" name="" ensure="" compliance="" with="" s="" terms="" use.="" personal="" information="" also="" be="" collected="" when="" you="" make="" purchases,="" participate="" surveys="" polls,="" respond="" special="" offers,="" give="" aways="" or="" promotions="" on="" site.="" in="" addition,="" site="" may="" store="" your="" electronic="" mail="" other="" as="" a="" necessary="" incident="" the="" transmission="" delivery="" those="" communications="" and="" to="" prevent="" misuse="" of="" our="" e-mail="" service.=""></p>
            <p class="text"> Please note: Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on
              message boards, in e-mails, or in chat areas on the Site, that
              information can be collected and used by others. If you post personal
              information in public places, others may send you unsolicited e-mail
              messages. Always be cautious about the information you provide online. </p>
            <p> 2. What are cookies and how do we use them? </p>
            <p class="text"> In our effort to provide services customized to Members' interests, we
              use cookies to keep and sometimes track information, such as which
              pages of the Site were visited, which website links were clicked and so
              on. A cookie is a small piece of data containing identifying
              information such as your login name that is sent to your browser from a
              web server, stored on your computer's hard drive and used to track
              pages that the user has visited. We may use cookies to access your
              account information (stored on our computers), to estimate our audience
              size for our advertisers, to identify which areas of our Site you have
              visited, and for other purposes in order to deliver better and more
              personalized services. </p>
            <p class="text"> You should also be aware that companies
              that advertise on our Site may use their own cookies. This Policy does
              not cover how these companies use their cookies. </p>
            <p class="text"> 3. How is my personal information used? </p>
            <p class="text"> Our primary goal in gathering your personal information is to provide
              our Members with a personalized experience. If we choose to customize
              content, we may compare your profile with other Member profiles and,
              based on their interests, we may make predictions about your interests.
              Based on these predictions, you may see specialized content, including
              advertising banners. We will not give advertisers direct access to any
              of your personal identification information. </p>
            <p class="text"> In addition, we (or those acting on our
              behalf) may send you e-mail notices about products, companies, and
              events that we think might interest you. </p>
            <p class="text"> We also may match information obtained
              from cookies with data provided by you for internal purposes only. This
              allows us to analyze this data both in the aggregate (for example,
              nine-tenths of our users own miniature skateboards) and in connection
              with individual users (for example, John Doe visits the Collector's
              Page the most). This information lets us tailor our services to your
              interests. </p>
            <p class="text"> We also reserve the right to provide
              analyses of our users as a group to prospective partners, advertisers,
              and other third parties. We do this, without revealing your identity,
              so that we and our advertisers can better understand your needs and
              interests, which allows us to keep bringing you advertisements that
              match your interests. </p>
            <p class="text"> In addition to using personal information
              collected on the Site in order to provide services to Members, we may
              disclose personal information to third parties as provided below: (a)
              when we are required to do so by law; (b) when we have reason to
              believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our
              rights or property or that of other Site users or anyone else; (c) to
              respond to an emergency; (d) if you have given us permission to do so,
              for example, by voluntarily participating in a promotion or making a
              purchase on the Site (where we then provide the information required to
              register for the promotion, or to ship your purchases, to the
              appropriate third-party service provider); and (e) with our
              contractors, consultants, or professional advisors, but only to the
              extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only
              under reasonable confidentiality restrictions. </p>
            <p class="text"> 4. Opting Out </p>
            <p class="text"> As part of the Member registration process you may opt out of receiving
              periodic e-mail messages about products, companies and events by simply
              telling us that when you give us your personal information. Or, you can
              easily edit your Member Profile or "Account" at any time to indicate
              that you no longer want to receive these messages. After you log in,
              just click on "My Profile". This will send you into the pages where you
              can review and modify your membership information and profile. From
              time to time we may e-mail Members important information regarding the
              Site or the use of the Site. Members may not opt out of receiving this
              information. </p>
            <p class="text"> 5. Can I update or correct my personal information? </p>
            <p class="text"> Your account information is contained within your Member Profile. You
              may edit your Profile at any time, all you need is your Member ID and
              Password. After you log in as a Member, click on "My Profile" from the
              homepage and you can view, update, and correct your account
              information. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual
              information that will remain within our databases, access logs, and
              other records, which may or may not contain personally identifiable
              information. </p>
            <p class="text"> 6. How does <em>TECHDECK.COM</em> protect my information? </p>
            <p class="text"> Your <em>TECHDECK.COM</em> Member Profile is password-protected. In order to maintain this
              protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, we recommend
              that, if you share your computer with other people, you sign out of
              your Member Account and close your browser window when you are done.
              Signing off will help protect your Member Profile information if you
              share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public
              place like a library. We use reasonable efforts to ensure that your
              personal information is secure on our system. Unfortunately, no data
              transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As
              a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you
              transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. YOU ARE ENTIRELY
              RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR MEMBER NAME AND
              PASSWORD AND FOR ANY AND ALL ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING PURCHASES) THAT ARE
              CONDUCTED THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT. </p>
            <p class="text"> 7. Former Members </p>
            <p class="text"> If you cease to be an active user or Member of the Site, we will
              continue to treat any personal information you have provided to us in
              connection with the Site in accordance with this Policy, as amended
              from time to time. We reserve the right to contact you via e-mail after
              you cease to be an active user or Member of the Site to inform you
              about updates and developments on the Site. </p>
            <p class="text"> 8. Linked Sites </p>
            <p class="text"> This Site may contain links to websites which enable access to content,
              products and services provided and controlled by parties other than <em>SPIN MASTER</em>. <em>SPIN MASTER</em> is not responsible for the availability of, the content provided on, or
              the consequences of use of these third party sites. You should refer to
              the policies posted by each such site regarding privacy and other
              topics of concern to you before you use it. <em>SPIN MASTER</em> provides links to other websites only as a convenience to its users,
              and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by <em>SPIN MASTER</em> of the linked site or the content, products and services available on it. </p>
            <p class="text"> 9. Exclusions </p>
            <p class="text"> This Policy does not restrict or prohibit our use or disclosure of
              publicly available information, even if such information is personal in
              nature, for example, information available in your local white pages.
              We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we
              collect from our visitors to a third party in the event that we sell or
              transfer substantially all of our assets related to the Site to such
              third party, provided such third party agrees to use such personal
              information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. </p>
            <p class="text"> 10. What about privacy for users under 13? </p>
            <p class="text"> Our registration process is designed to protect the privacy of anyone
              under the age of 13 by requiring that they obtain parental permission
              before becoming a Member. The process is as follows: when a child under
              the age of 13 signs up to become a Member, one of that child's parents
              must fill out, sign and submit a Parental Consent form. Once we receive
              the form, we send the parent a confirmation e-mail along with the
              child's username and password. We do not knowingly collect any
              information from children under the age of 13 without notifying a
              parent and giving the parent the opportunity to deny their child's
              membership. Parents can also revoke permission to let their children
              participate on the Site at any time. This process is designed to comply
              with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Guidelines. </p>
