<b>X-CONCEPTS<br>
PRIVACY POLICY</b>
</p><p>
<b>This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 1, 2001.</b>
</p><p>Parents and Guardians:  <a href="coppa.asp">Click here for more details about our policies regarding use of our site by children under 13</a>.
</p><p>X-CONCEPTS, LLC ("X-CONCEPTS" or "TECHDECK.COM"), who owns and operates the website currently located at www.techdeck.com  ("Site"), believes that safeguarding your privacy is serious business. Please take a minute to read the following privacy policy ("Policy") so that you understand how we treat your personal information. The purpose of this Policy is to help you understand what kinds of personally identifiable information we may gather about you when you visit the Site, how we may use that information, whether we will disclose it and how you can correct that information. As we modify and expand our services, this Policy might change, so please review it periodically. You can tell if the Policy has been modified since you last reviewed it by checking the date at the beginning of the Policy.  By signing up to be a TECHDECK.COM member ("Member") or using the Site or any of TECHDECK.COM's services offered on the Site, you agree to these terms.  If you have questions about the Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@techdeck.com">info@techdeck.com</a>. 
</p><p>You should be aware that our advertisers or websites that have links on our Site may collect personally identifiable information about you. We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such websites and the Policy does not address the information practices of those websites or advertisers.  Your use of the Site is governed by our <a href="TOS.asp">Terms of Use</a> and by other published rules pertaining to particular products and services offered through the Site.  
</p><ol>
<b></b><li><b>What personally identifying information about me is collected and who collects it?</b><br><br>
Personally identifying information, or personal information, means your name, home or other address, e-mail address, telephone number, birthday, interests or any other information that tells another person who you are when you volunteer this information.  We may request and collect such information in the course of providing services on the Site, e.g., when you register to become a Member.  Other information, such as your account status and choice of services, is created and maintained by the Site in the normal course of providing service to our Members and other users. Your personal information may be collected when you contribute an article, video or other feature for the Site in order for us to credit you by name and ensure compliance with the Site's <a href="TOS.asp">Terms of Use</a>.  Your personal information may also be collected when you make purchases, participate in surveys or polls, or respond to special offers, give aways or promotions on the Site.  In addition, the Site may store your electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications and to prevent misuse of our e-mail service.
<p>Please note: Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards, in e-mails, or in chat areas on the Site, that information can be collected and used by others. If you post personal information in public places, others may send you unsolicited e-mail messages. Always be cautious about the information you provide online. 
<br><br><b></b></p></li><li><b>What are cookies and how do we use them?</b><br><br>
In our effort to provide services customized to Members' interests, we use cookies to keep and sometimes track information, such as which pages of the Site were visited, which website links were clicked and so on.  A cookie is a small piece of data containing identifying information such as your login name that is sent to your browser from a web server, stored on your computer's hard drive and used to track pages that the user has visited.  We may use cookies to access your account information (stored on our computers), to estimate our audience size for our advertisers, to identify which areas of our Site you have visited, and for other purposes in order to deliver better and more personalized services.   
<p>You should also be aware that companies that advertise on our Site may use their own cookies. This Policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. 
<br><br><b></b></p></li><li><b>How is my personal information used?</b><br><br>
Our primary goal in gathering your personal information is to provide our Members with a personalized experience.  If we choose to customize content, we may compare your profile with other Member profiles and, based on their interests, we may make predictions about your interests. Based on these predictions, you may see specialized content, including advertising banners. We will not give advertisers direct access to any of your personal identification information.
<p>In addition, we (or those acting on our behalf) may send you e-mail notices about products, companies, and events that we think might interest you. 
</p><p>We also may match information obtained from cookies with data provided by you for internal purposes only.  This allows us to analyze this data both in the aggregate (for example, nine-tenths of our users own miniature skateboards) and in connection with individual users (for example, John Doe visits the Collector's Page the most). This information lets us tailor our services to your interests. 
</p><p>We also reserve the right to provide analyses of our users as a group to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. We do this, without revealing your identity, so that we and our advertisers can better understand your needs and interests, which allows us to keep bringing you advertisements that match your interests. 
</p><p>In addition to using personal information collected on the Site in order to provide services to Members, we may disclose personal information to third parties as provided below: (a) when we are required to do so by law; (b) when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property or that of other Site users or anyone else; (c) to respond to an emergency; (d) if you have given us permission to do so, for example, by voluntarily participating in a promotion or making a purchase on the Site (where we then provide the information required to register for the promotion, or to ship your purchases, to the appropriate third-party service provider); and (e) with our contractors, consultants, or professional advisors, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under reasonable confidentiality restrictions.
<br><br><b></b></p></li><li><b>Opting Out.</b><br><br>
As part of the Member registration process you may opt out of receiving periodic e-mail messages about products, companies and events by simply telling us that when you give us your personal information. Or, you can easily edit your Member Profile or "Account" at any time to indicate that you no longer want to receive these messages. After you log in, just click on "My Profile". This will send you into the pages where you can review and modify your membership information and profile. From time to time we may e-mail Members important information regarding the Site or the use of the Site.  Members may not opt out of receiving this information.
<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>Can I update or correct my personal information?</b><br><br>
Your account information is contained within your Member Profile. You may edit your Profile at any time, all you need is your Member ID and Password. After you log in as a Member, click on "My Profile" from the homepage and you can view, update, and correct your account information. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within our databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain personally identifiable information.
<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>How does TECHDECK.COM protect my information?</b><br><br>
Your TECHDECK.COM Member Profile is password-protected.  In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, we recommend that, if you share your computer with other people, you sign out of your Member Account and close your browser window when you are done. Signing off will help protect your Member Profile information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library. We use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information is secure on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  YOU ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR MEMBER NAME AND PASSWORD AND FOR ANY AND ALL ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING PURCHASES) THAT ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT.
<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>Former Members.</b><br><br>
If you cease to be an active user or Member of the Site, we will continue to treat any personal information you have provided to us in connection with the Site in accordance with this Policy, as amended from time to time.  We reserve the right to contact you via e-mail after you cease to be an active user or Member of the Site to inform you about updates and developments on the Site.
<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>Linked Sites.</b><br><br>
This Site may contain links to websites which enable access to content, products and services provided and controlled by parties other than X-CONCEPTS.  X-CONCEPTS is not responsible for the availability of, the content provided on, or the consequences of use of these third party sites.  You should refer to the policies posted by each such site regarding privacy and other topics of concern to you before you use it.  X-CONCEPTS provides links to other websites only as a convenience to its users, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by X-CONCEPTS of the linked site or the content, products and services available on it.  
<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>Exclusions.</b><br><br>
This Policy does not restrict or prohibit our use or disclosure of publicly available information, even if such information is personal in nature, for example, information available in your local white pages.  We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from our visitors to a third party in the event that we sell or transfer substantially all of our assets related to the Site to such third party, provided such third party agrees to use such personal information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
<br><br><b></b></li><li><b>What about privacy for users under 13?</b><br><br>
Our registration process is designed to protect the privacy of anyone under the age of 13 by requiring that they obtain parental permission before becoming a Member.  The process is as follows: when a child under the age of 13 signs up to become a Member, one of that child's parents must fill out, sign and submit a Parental Consent form. Once we receive the form, we send the parent a confirmation e-mail along with the child's username and password. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 without notifying a parent and giving the parent the opportunity to deny their child's membership. Parents can also revoke permission to let their children participate on the Site at any time.  This process is designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Guidelines.  <a href="coppa.asp">Click here for more details about our policies regarding use of our Site by children under 13</a>.
