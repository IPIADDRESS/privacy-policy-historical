            <p></p>

            <p>We collect information you provide to us through our websites and to affiliated micro-sites that are owned and operated by Technology Networks Ltd. We collect your information when you create an account, subscribe to a newsletter or email, download digital materials (e.g. infographics, ebooks, white papers etc.), sign-up for a webinar or otherwise communicate with us through our websites.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The data we collect from you can include personal information. Personal information is data that can be used to identify an individual (such as first and last name, e-mail address, address, telephone number etc.).  Furthermore, to ensure that you have a genuine interest in our content, products and services, we may also ask for work-related information such as your job title, your company name, technologies you use, your area of work or industry, the type of business you work for or own, and your scientific interests. We do this to ensure that we are providing you with information that is relevant to you and your field of study or work. At no point will we ask for any “sensitive” information such as religious beliefs, political affiliation, racial or ethnic origin or any other information that does not pertain to your activity or interest in the sciences.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once registration is complete no further information is required for free access to this site. Additional personal information from visitors may be required to participate in online forums.</p>
