                        <br>
                        What Information Do We Collect?</strong><br>

                          <ol>

3] Web Site Use Information<br>
<br>
Similar to other commercial Web  sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies"  (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files  to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information  gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and  time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the  Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. </strong>
                          </ol>                          
                          <strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong><br>
                          Broadly  speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our  business activities, providing the products and services you requested,  to process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our  marketing and promotional efforts and improve our content and service  offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, services and for  other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor it  to meet your needs.<br>
                          <br>
                          Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an  aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business  information will not be shared with parties except as required by law.                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
                          A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an  anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's  computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site  can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences  allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web  site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies  sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.  However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the  configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have  your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site  will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie  cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer  viruses.                          <strong><br>
                          <br>
                          How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>
                          As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files,  allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web  site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies.

                          <br>
                          <strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
                          IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to  the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on  the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically  collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data  known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request)  can be sent to you.<br>
                          <br>                          <strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong><br>
                          We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that  uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal  details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process  transactions or provide services that you have requested.<br>
                          <br>                          <strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong><br>
                          You may request access to all your personally identifiable information  that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at  the usual address.<br>
                          <br>                          <strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</strong><br>
                          We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other  words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for  the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account  information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect  the safety of our users and the Public.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong><br>
                          We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked  to or from our Web site or the information or content contained  therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers  to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web  site.<br>
                          <br>
                          Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to  another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your  browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites,  which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own  rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before  proceeding.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
                          By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your  personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve  the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without  notice.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong><br>
                          Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our  computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in  the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country  of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain  data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put  in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>A Special Note About Children</strong><br>
                          Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask  that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal  information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in  conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <strong>Policy Modifications</strong><br>
                          We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes  are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us  permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check  back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy  Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information  you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is  materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior  consent. </td>
