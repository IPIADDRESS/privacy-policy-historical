<b>Anonymous TECHNOCASH "digital-cash"</b><br>
</td>

<tr>

We want to provide you with a service that enhances your life and 
your internet shopping experiences and personal or business financial transactions.

To this end we have our anonymous TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" which is intrinsically private and ensures
no personal information is collect by Technocash,Inc.
We transact using SSL to provide that your transactions are encrypted when you are dealing with us and your
TECHNOCASH "digital-cash". We are capable of 128b bit encryption and the you should be aware that the local browser often determines a lower level of encryption.\
It is the user of TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" to administer this capability. We allow for all users to transact with use without forcing you to upgrade your software.

Of course we record where the individual pieces of "digital-cash" are used
for your records so that the history attached to each piece of  TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" can show details of use. 
Thus, please view it as a mini anonymous account.

Use of this format provides features which enable and empower you to buy
and sell with confidence. Adding Passwords or even re-issuing a fresh Tcode number allows for person to person escrow services.
<b>You must only rely on connections to www.technocash.com or secure.technocash.com or  www.technocash.com.au
or secure.technocash.com.au</b> to inform you of any cash value and its currency for any  TECHNOCASH "digital-cash". 

It's none of our business what you spend, where you spend, what you spend it on or how much you spend.
We don't need to know this information to provide our service for our anonymous TECHNOCASH "digital-cash". 
Without our knowledge you can send you TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" in whole or part to others. 

We won't be marketing to you as an individual if you possess some  TECHNOCASH "digital-cash".
We keep no records about you the specific TECHNOCASH owner. Owning a BillFold is somewhat different see below. For example a BillFold
allows you to enter and store personal and business information and indeed some BillFolds are fully identified 
eg: Retail BillFolds disclose the details so the shoppers can have piece of mind they are interacting with a known merchant. During the payment cycle we may make offers on behalf
of some of our merchants this is simply trying to match your  TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" to places it could be used at.

As TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" is transferable no one to one connection to any individual can be established.
We simply manage your loose "digital-cash" value and provide transaction verification services. 
No club membership is needed for you to enjoy all the features of loose TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" or our site. You have privacy and security when you use TECHNOCASH. We want anyone to be able to use the net shop and make person to person transfers. 
If you choose to participate in any of our specials or promotions then we may have your contact details and these are for internal use or the use stated at the time. Many times all we need is an Email address to contact you on. It is our policy to honour the "unsubscribe" option to any mailing lists we may have. All other promotion and business activities are confidential anyway and are not, and cannot, be linked to your private TECHNOCASH numbers. 

We will offer promotional offers, sometimes in conjunction with our merchants,
based on individual TECHNOCASH details such as "remaining value" and may place these offers where appropriate during the payment and detail checking stages both the TECHNOCASH owners and merchants. This is so we can offer you say the latest special for a $8.95 service/product when your TECHNOCASH has say $9.30 left to spend. 
We re-inforce that we do not "mine" any of our data records to be used by outside bodies.
