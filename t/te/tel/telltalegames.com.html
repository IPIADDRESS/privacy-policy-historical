<div class="privacypolicy">
<p>Welcome! Telltale, Inc. (âTelltaleâ) values its fans and customers, and we are glad to have you visit us.  We are committed not only to making great games, but also to respecting the privacy rights of everyone who visits and uses our website.  This Privacy Policy provides a guide as to how we collect, store and use the information that you provide to us online, including how we may share information, and it will also let you know how you can change the way we may collect personal information from you.  We also discuss notices of changes that may be made to this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy applies to any website owned or controlled by Telltale, including applications, and references to a âSiteâ are applicable to all such websites including <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com">www.telltalegames.com</a>.  This Privacy Policy does not apply towards any information that we may collect from you offline.  BY USING ANY OF OUR SITES, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SITES.</p>

<p><strong>What information do we collect and how is it used?</strong></p>

<p>The type of information that Telltale collects will vary depending on the activity collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include what is known as âpersonally identifiable informationâ or âpersonal informationâ including your first and last name, e-mail address, account information for certain third party sites or networks such as Facebook or Twitter, phone numbers (including cell phone numbers), home address, and zip code.  Personally identifiable information can be accessed in order to directly contact you. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as, receiving our newsletters or participating in contests or sweepstakes).  We also collect additional types of personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card and billing and shipping information, including physical addresses and phone numbers) when someone purchases products and offerings at our Sites.  Such purchases are governed by our Terms of Use, <a href="/termsofuse">http://www.telltalegames.com/termsofuse</a>, the terms and conditions of which are incorporated herein by reference.  We may share your personal information with third parties solely in order to have them assist with fulfillment of product sales, including shipping and credit card processing, and companies that assist us with e-mailings, but such third parties agree to maintain the security of your personal information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as: gender: information about your computer, hardware, software and/or platform; Internet IP address and connection; information about online activity such as website usage and time spent on the FDI website; and, other data that you may provide.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic Newsletter and Subscription to other Updates about Telltale</strong></p>

<p>Telltale offers users the opportunity to sign up to receive the Telltale monthly newsletter as well as news, web, game and press updates related to Telltale (collectively, âUpdatesâ).  Telltale does not guarantee or promise the frequency in which Updates may be sent and reserves the right to discontinue sending Updates at any time.  To sign up for Updates, you must be eligible to register with Telltale and provide your e-mail address, first name, create a password and, at your option, a screen name.</p>

<p>Information collected for Telltale Updates may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the Updates and perform other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.  </p>

<p>Sign-up for Updates is always optional, and users who no longer wish to receive our Updates and communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in the email or email us at <a href="mailto:optout@telltalegames.com">optout@telltalegames.com</a>. or you may contact us by post at Telltale, Inc., Attn: Customer Service, PO Box 9737, San Rafael, CA 94912-9737 or by telephone at (415) 258-1648 ext. 200 to opt-out. You can also change your preferences in the âMy Telltaleâ section of our Site:</p>

<p><strong>Forums</strong></p>

<p>At your own discretion, and once you meet certain eligibility requirements, you may choose to post or upload additional facts and material about yourself and your profile, including a biography, birth date (with the year being optional) a profile picture, your location, your interests or your occupation.  Such postings may be made on the âForumsâ section of our Site, which are governed by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.  Such additional facts and material can be entered (or changed) on the âEdit My Profileâ section of the Forums.  Telltaleâs Forums are used for exchanging information and social networking.  Please note that information, additional facts or any other materials that you post anywhere on our Sites, including any information or materials that you choose to make public on the Forums, will be available for any user to read, and are therefore no longer private.  A third party may disclose any information or materials you choose to post.  Also, information and material that you post could be used by someone to send you unsolicited messages. Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our Forums or other message areas (although Telltale reserves the right to remove any such public postings in its sole discretion), and we are not responsible for the personally identifiable information or material you choose to submit. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Use.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information from Third Parties/Social Networking Sites</strong></p>

<p>Provided that you have first given permission to the applicable third party, Telltale may receive information from third parties, including Facebook and Twitter, related to your accounts on those services.   Information that we collect from those third parties from whom you have given permission may be used by Telltale solely in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><strong>Policy Against Unsolicited Submissions</strong></p>

<p>As further described in our Terms of Use, please note that Telltale has a policy against accepting unsolicited material, so we ask that you do not submit any unsolicited or unique creative ideas, drawings or other materials to Telltale directly or otherwise in connection with any posts you make to the Forums or in connection with additional facts or material you may provide in any posting on any of our Sites.</p>

<p><strong>Referring a Friend</strong></p>

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We may automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Telltale stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:optout@telltalegames.com">optout@telltalegames.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<p><strong>Special Promotions, Online Contests and Sweepstakes</strong></p>

<p>Telltale and its advertisers and/or other business partners may have special online promotions, contests or sweepstakes (collectively, âPromotionsâ) which feature products or services related to Telltaleâs business activities. For most Promotions, you must be 13 years or older to participate (unless otherwise specified by the promotionsâ rules and regulations).  Also, if you are under 18 years of age or otherwise considered a minor, and if you are eligible to participate in a Promotion (including, eligibility for registration with Telltale), you will need your parentâs or guardianâs written consent to collect your prize or receive any benefit to which you may be entitled.  If you have won a prize, we may also collect your physical address and phone number.  For other Promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular Promotions will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. </p>

<p><strong>Third Party Links</strong></p>

<p>To provide relevant information not found on our Sites, Telltale may provide links from our Sites to third party websites. We encourage our users to read third party websites' privacy policies before submitting personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Correspondence With Telltale</strong></p>

<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our Sites, we may collect such information into a file which is only accessed by authorized personnel. We may also collect other users' comments about you in our complaints department. </p>

<p><strong>Tracking Information of our Users</strong></p>

<p>In the course of using our Sites, we automatically track certain information such as your IP addresses and email addresses.  We may tie your IP address to your personally identifiable information.  We automatically track information through the use of a âcookie.â A âcookieâ is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Telltale uses cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information through the Sites. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Sites (for example, advertisers). We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for third parties set cookies for advertising.</p>

<p>Information we collect through cookies and other information from our log files about your activity on the Sites is used to help resolve technical problems or issues and may also assist in making your visit more enjoyable (for example, using a cookie will allow you to use certain features on our Sites without having to log in each time you visit).   </p>

<p>Telltale also collects IP addresses (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information internally and to some of our business partners and advertisers and to audit the use of our Sites. When visitors request pages on one of our Sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We collect log files that record activity on our Sites and gather statistics about visitorâs time and activity on the Sites.  The statistics are generated anonymously, and they help us in connection with marketing and demographic studies as we enhance our Sites.  Telltale does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. Telltale can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, to protect our services, Sites or a person or entity. </p>

<p>If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will post a notice prominently on our Sites. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. </p>

<p><strong>Your use of Other Users' Information</strong></p>

<p>You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Telltale reserves the right to terminate those who misuse other users' information or who otherwise violate the Telltale Terms of Use. </p>

<p><strong>Control of Your Password </strong></p>

<p>You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. </p>

<p><strong>Reviewing, Changing or Deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>Once you register, you will be able to review and change much of your personally identifiable information at Telltale including:</p>

<p>Your email address, password and subscription settings.</p>

<p>Please promptly update your information if it changes by logging in to your account and following the screen prompts. We strongly urge you to periodically change your password to help reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your account information.  We will retain in our files information, including personal information, you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, comply with contest rules and law, comply with industry rules and regulations, enhance security, reduce fraud, comply with federal and state law and to enforce our Terms of Use. </p>

<p>If you or your child has submitted personal information to us, and you would like to change it or remove it from our records, you have any of the following choices to modify or delete such information from our database: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Visit <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/mytelltale/unsubscribe">http://www.telltalegames.com/mytelltale/unsubscribe </a></li>
    <li>Log in with your password and modify/delete your profile; </li>
    <li>Send a letter to Telltale, PO Box 9737, San Rafael, CA 94912-9737 </li>
    <li>Call us at (415) 258-1638 extension 200</li>

</ul>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers only information that is collected through our Sites, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the Sites. </p>

<p>Our Sites may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Telltale is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site(s) to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
