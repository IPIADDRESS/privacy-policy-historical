Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google
Analytics uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer, to help
us analyze and track how visitors use the Site and our Services. The

advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ
cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to
measure advertising effectiveness. However, we have no access to or control

of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent
across the Internet), for the purposes of system administration, to report
aggregate information internally and to some of our business partners and
advertisers and to audit the use of our Sites or Services. When visitors
request pages on one of our Sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses.
We collect log files that record activity on our Sites and gather statistics
about visitor’s time and activity on the Sites.&nbsp; The statistics are generated
anonymously, and they help us in connection with marketing and demographic
studies as we enhance our Sites.&nbsp; Telltale does not normally link IP addresses
to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be
logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. Telltale can and will use IP
addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance
with our Terms of Use, to protect our services, Sites or a person or entity. </span></p>

your information in this different manner. In some cases where we post the
notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from
us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. </span></p>
