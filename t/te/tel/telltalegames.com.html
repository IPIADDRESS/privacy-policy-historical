            <h2>Welcome! </h2>
            <p>Telltale, Inc. (“Telltale”) values its fans and customers, and we are glad to have you visit us.  We are committed not only to making great games, but also to respecting the privacy rights of everyone who visits and uses our website or our online services.  This Privacy Policy provides a guide as to how we collect, store and use the information that you provide to us online (including information provided during online game play) and explains how we may share information.  It will also let you know how you can change the way we may collect personal information from you.  We also discuss notices of changes that may be made to this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy applies to our online mobile products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and also to any website owned or controlled by Telltale and references to a “Site” are applicable to all such websites including www.telltalegames.com.  This Privacy Policy does not apply towards any information that we may collect from you offline.  BY USING ANY OF OUR SITES OR OUR ONLINE MOBILE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SITES.  </p>

            <h4>What information do we collect and how is it used?</h4>

            <p>The type of information that Telltale collects will vary depending on the activity collected will vary depending upon the activity and may include what is known as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” including your first and last name, e-mail address, account information for certain third party sites or networks such as Facebook or Twitter, phone numbers (including cell phone numbers), home address, and zip code.  Personally identifiable information can be accessed in order to directly contact you. This information is collected so that visitors can participate in activities (such as, receiving our newsletters or participating in contests or sweepstakes).  We also collect additional types of personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card and billing and shipping information, including physical addresses and phone numbers) when someone purchases products and offerings at our Sites or through use of our Services.  Such purchases are governed by our Terms of Use, http://www.telltalegames.com/termsofuse, the terms and conditions of which are incorporated herein by reference.  We may share your personal information with third parties solely in order to have them assist with fulfillment of product sales, including shipping and credit card processing, and companies that assist us with e-mailings, but such third parties agree to maintain the security of your personal information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We may also share personal information with third parties to prevent abuse of our Site or Services and also to comply with any laws, notices or orders from a governmental agency or entity or to prevent harm to a user of our Site or Services.</p>

            <p>Some of our websites and Services use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyze and track how visitors use the Site and our Services. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Services will be transmitted to and stored on Google servers and may be accessed by us.  Google uses this information to help us evaluate how our websites are used. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Third party sites and services you access through our Services may also employ cookies.</p>

            <p>Cookies also allow us to see what you may have purchased, either from our Site or through using one of our Services including game play.  We collect information on our online games you have played, and we also track your play within an online game (including online games you may have purchased from a third party website) and purchases that you may make within an online game.   We may send you notifications based on information we learn from cookies, including notifications related to purchasing additional games or products from us.</p>

            <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for third parties set cookies for advertising.</p>

            <p>Telltale also collects IP addresses (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information internally and to some of our business partners and advertisers and to audit the use of our Sites or Services. When visitors request pages on one of our Sites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We collect log files that record activity on our Sites and gather statistics about visitor’s time and activity on the Sites.  The statistics are generated anonymously, and they help us in connection with marketing and demographic studies as we enhance our Sites.  Telltale does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. Telltale can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, to protect our services, Sites or a person or entity.</p>

            <p>We may also use cookies to track postings to online discussions about our Services that are controlled by us.  While you can disable cookies, some areas of our Site or our Services may not function with all available features if you do so.</p>

            <p>If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will post a notice prominently on our Sites. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>

            <p>We may share some aggregate data that we learn about users (which is data that does not contain personal information) with third parties.  </p>

            <h4>Data Transfer to the United States</h4>

            <p>Telltale operates its Sites within the United States. With your consent Telltale will transfer your email address to the United States.

            <h4>Special Note to Parents and Guardians</h4>

            <p>Anyone using the Internet should ensure that their privacy is being protected.  This is especially true for kids under the age of 13 (defined herein as a “child” or, if the reference is to more than on child, then we will refer to “children”).  Telltale is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.  We ask parents and guardians of children to discuss what information should be released on the Internet, especially personal information.  Telltale does not condition a child's participation in any of the activities available on our Sites on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.</p>

            <p>Telltale does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  Note that Telltale may collect personally identifiable information from users of the Sites or Services who are over 13 and under 18, and the collection and retention of this information is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  When a user in the 13-18 year old age category submits personally identifiable information, Telltale may, in accordance with applicable laws or regulations or at Telltale’s discretion, request a parent or guardian's e-mail address to notify the parent or guardian of the activity of the user in this age category.</p>

            <p>In accordance with applicable rules and regulations, or at Telltale’s discretion, some areas of our Sites or Services may not be accessible to anyone under the age of 18, regardless of whether a parent or guardian has provided consent.</p>

            <h4>Security</h4>

            <p>Telltale has security measures in place to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Telltale uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information such as firewalls. While "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, our technical experts at Telltale work hard to ensure your secure use of our services.</p>

            <h4>Merger or Acquisition</h4>

            <p>While Telltale does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties except as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, please note that in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Telltale’s customer information (including your personally identifiable information) may be transferred to Telltale’s successors or assigns, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.</p>

            <h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>

            <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request from companies conducting business in California a list of third parties to which the company may have disclosed personally identifiable information for direct marketing purposes.  Telltale does not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes; however, if you believe Telltale may have shared such information, please feel free to contact Telltale at privacy@telltalegames.com or contact us at the physical address noted above (and provide contact information so that we may respond to you).  Telltale will promptly respond to any requests in accordance with applicable law.</p>

            <h4>Safe Harbor Program</h4>

            <p>Telltale complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
