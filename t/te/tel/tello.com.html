      <h2>Our commitment to your privacy</h2>

      <p>Urban Airship, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Urban Airship”), respects your individual privacy.
        Our privacy policy documents our adherence to industry standards for the protection of your personal
        information.</p>
      <h3>Scope of the Privacy Policy</h3>

      <p>This Privacy Policy covers Urban Airship’s treatment of personally identifiable information that may be
        collected while you are on the Urban Airship site, when you order its products or that is shared with Urban
        Airship by its business partners. This policy does not apply to (i) Urban Airship’s treatment of
        personally identifiable information that may be collected while you use Urban Airship’s products or
        services, which such treatment shall be subject to and governed solely by the terms of Urban Airship’s
        then-current Service Agreement, available at <a href="http://www.urbanairship.com/legal/">www.urbanairship.com/legal</a>, or (ii) the
        practices of companies not owned or controlled by Urban Airship or to people whom Urban Airship does not employ
        or manage, nor does it address non-personally identifiable information. The policy specifically addresses the
        following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected by Urban Airship or by any third party through our
          site;
        </li>
        <li>How Urban Airship uses this information;</li>
        <li>With whom Urban Airship may share this information;</li>
        <li>What choices are available to you as a user of the site with respect to collection, use and distribution of
          the information;
        </li>
        <li>What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information
          under our control; and
        </li>
        <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

      <p>Urban Airship is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Urban Airship may collect
        information from you at two different stages. First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all
        visitors to the site. This information is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is only
        used in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the use of our site. Second, Urban Airship collects
        personally identifiable information when you create a Urban Airship account and when you order Urban Airship
        products or utilize certain services. Online account creation may require you to submit the following personal
        information: name, address, company information, email address, and phone number. For purposes of billing, you
        may need to provide your credit card type, number, expiration date and billing address for the card. Certain
        personally identifiable information is required if you subscribe to a Urban Airship newsletter, or sign up to
        participate in a promotion, sweepstake or survey through the site. Urban Airship may also receive personally
        identifiable information from our business partners.</p>
      <h3>Personal Information of Children Under 13</h3>

      <p>Urban Airship complies with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and
        the FTC’s Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). This site is not directed to children and does not
        knowingly collect any personally identifiable information form children under 13 years of age.</p>
      <h3>Your Disclosures to Third Parties</h3>

      <p>To the extent you include personal data in your submissions (such as your email address, phone number or photo
        of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your user account, and contact you.
        Please do not include information in your submissions that you expect to keep private. In addition, you can
        reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a fictitious account name, though doing so could
        detract from the credibility of your submissions. Please also note that the personal messages you send or
        receive using any website personal messaging feature, if available, are only private to the extent that you and
        the sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any control over whether a recipient of one
        of your personal messages publicly posts the contents of such a message.</p>
      <h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>

      <p>Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized
        experience while using our site and to allow us to provide products and services to you. Urban Airship will
        never give your information to, or share your information with, any third party not affiliated with or owned by
        Urban Airship, except as permitted by law. Urban Airship will send personally identifiable information about you
        to other companies or people when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have your consent to share the information;</li>
        <li>We need to share your information to provide the products or services you have requested;</li>
        <li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Urban Airship to provide a product or
          service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally
          identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); or
        </li>
        <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or find that your actions on our web site violate
          the Urban Airship Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Profile</h3>

      <p>We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our customers. A
        profile is stored information detailing how individual customers use the site. Collected information in a
        profile is tied to the customer’s personally identifiable information. However, your profile is used
        solely for internal purposes, to help us improve the experience of our customers. We do not share your profile
        with any third parties.</p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>

      <p>A cookie is a small text file stored on the customer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. The
        cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Allowing a Urban Airship cookie to
        remain on your computer makes it easier for you to log in to and use the site.</p>
      <h3>Log files</h3>

      <p>Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP)
        referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the
        site, track a customer’s movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
        use. IP addresses, etc are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
      <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information As Required By Law</h3>

      <p>We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we have good-faith belief that such action is
        necessary to (a) comply with current judicial proceedings, a court order or legal process served on us, (b)
        protect and defend our rights, or (c) protect the rights, property, and other interests of our users or
        others.</p>
      <h3>Business Transitions</h3>

      <p>In the event that Urban Airship goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
        company, or sale of a portion of its assets, our customers’ personal information may be part of the assets
        transferred. Customers will be notified via prominent notice on our site prior to a change of ownership or
        control of their personal information. If, as a result of the business transaction, your personally identifiable
        information will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, you will
        be given a choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section.</p>
      <h3>Links</h3>

      <p>This site may contain links to and portions of other sites. Urban Airship is not responsible for the privacy
        practices or content of these other sites. When you leave our site or view a portion of a third party’s
        site through our site, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of each such site. This privacy statement
        applies solely to information collected by Urban Airship.</p>
      <h3>Security</h3>

      <p>Wherever your personal information may be held within Urban Airship or on its behalf, we intend to take
        commercially reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from
        unauthorized access or disclosure. However, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security
        measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. We use encryption to protect
        sensitive information online. The servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed in a
        secure environment. Finally, we also make an effort to protect your information off-line.<br>
        When registering for access to a secure area of the site, we may ask you to select a username and password. We
        recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an
        unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered site and close
        your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal
        information and correspondence when accessing your computer.</p>
      <h3>Correcting, Updating, Deleting and Deactivating Personal Information</h3>

      <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may contact us to correct, update or delete and
        deactivate our record of your personally identifiable information.</p>
      <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

      <p>Urban Airship may edit this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes, we will prominently
        post a notice on the main page and other pages to alert you of the change.</p>
      <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

      <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers who are California residents to request that Urban
        Airship not share their personal data with third parties for such parties’ direct marketing purposes. To
        make such a request, send an e-mail with “California Privacy” in the subject line to
        <a href="mailto:support@urbanairship.com">support@urbanairship.com</a> or write to us at the address listed
