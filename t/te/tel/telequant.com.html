		<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#333333">Your privacy is vital to 
		our long-term relationship with you, and protecting your privacy is just 
		one part of our mission to provide you with highly personalized and 
		valuable service. In addition, in an effort to comply with the 
		Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly 
		collect personally identifying information from children under the age 
		of 13.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		This statement describes our privacy policy with respect to:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		a) What information is collected; how information is collected; and by 
		whom is information collected;<br>
		b) The sharing of collected information;<br>
		c) How you can access, change or limit the information collected about 
		you;<br>
		d) Security of information;<br>
		e) Amendments to our Privacy Policy;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Required Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
		To register on our Web site, you must submit your name and e-mail 
		address. In addition, to purchase a calling card, you must submit 
		additional information, including your address, phone number and credit 
		card information. This required personally identifiable information is 
		necessary for us to process transactions for you, protect you against 
		credit card fraud and contact you. When you register with Telequant, we 
		will ask you for e-mail and a phone number. We will never share the 
		information stored on that database, as well as other information we 
		collect or you provide with any business partners or third parties, 
		including those who offer services that complement those provided by us 
		or which we believe may be of interest to you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Transaction Information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		When you authorize a purchase transaction, we will collect certain 
		information related to that transaction such as the location from which 
		you are requesting the search or transaction, the product or service 
		involved, the quantity or amount of the product or service and certain 
		personally identifiable information, such as your password, your credit 
		card information and any special handling requests. This personally 
		identifiable information will never knowingly appear in public areas of 
		our Web site. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Third Party Information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		During the processing of your transactions, we collect verification 
		information from our credit card authorization services. Credit card 
		authorization services verify that credit card information and address 
		that they have on file for you matches the information that you have 
		provided to us. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
		General Information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		We collect general information about you when you visit our web site. 
		This information includes technical information related to your computer 
		and the manner in which you are accessing our site and includes such 
		information as the internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, what 
		operating system your computer is using, what browser software (e.g., 
		Explorer, Netscape or other) your computer is using, and who your 
		Internet service provider is, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of 
		the web site from which you just came and the URL to which you go next 
		and certain operating metrics, such as the amount of time you use our 
		Web site. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
		The general information that we gather about you may be aggregated with 
		general information of all users to help us better understand how our 
		site is used. In addition, we aggregate the general information and the 
		personal information. We compile and analyze this aggregated information 
		so that we can provide more meaningful information to corporate partners 
		and more relevant content and advertisements to you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		The Sharing of Collected Information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		As noted above, we only share certain information about you with those 
		of our vendors who are responsible for handling your account or 
		performing other necessary services that you require. We will not share 
		your personally identifying information with other third parties without 
		your consent, except for the following limited purposes: <br>
&nbsp;<br>
		a) We are compelled to do so by law or by an order of a court or 
		governmental authority.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		b) In order to cooperate with law enforcement authorities or 
		governmental regulatory bodies, and if we find any fraudulent 
		activities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		c) As necessary to complete a transaction for you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		d) If you use our Web site through a link from one of our promotional 
		partners, then we may be required to share your user registration 
		information or other personally identifying information about any search 
		or transaction that you initiate through such promotional partner with 
		that partner. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Aggregated General Information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		In addition, we may share aggregated general information about our site 
		with our business partners or the general public. For example, we may 
		share information regarding the daily number of unique users to our site 
		with potential corporate partners or others. Aggregated data does not 
		contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you.
		<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Third Party Sites.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		We may publish links to other sites from our web site. Please note that 
		Telequant does not control the content, practices or policies of any 
		other sites, including what information those sites collect about you. 
		Accordingly, we do not endorse or hold ourselves responsible for the 
		privacy policies or information gathering practices of any site that you 
		may link to from our site. In addition, you may choose to respond to 
		advertisements that are posted on our web site or made available via our 
		service or to direct marketing offers from third party sponsors or 
		advertisers. We do not control the content, practices or policies of our 
		sponsors or advertisers and, accordingly, do not endorse or hold 
		ourselves responsible for the privacy policies or information gathering 
		practices of any sponsor or advertiser who may collect information about 
		you. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
		Amendments to Our Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		We may, from time to time, amend our Privacy Policy. If we do, then we 
		will post such amendments to this document so that you may always have 
		access to our most recent policy. We reserve the right, at our 
		discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy 
		Policy at any time and from time to time. If at any point we decide to 
		disclose personal information in a manner different from that stated at 
		the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. You will be 
		given the choice at that time to "opt-out" of any disclosures of your 
		personal information that you made available to us prior to the change 
		in our policy. </font></p>
