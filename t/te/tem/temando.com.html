<h4>Under 18s</h4>
    <p><b>Children are eligible to use our services</b> but we ask that minors (under 18 years of age) have parental approval to use our site.</p>    
    <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to  provide you with a <b>smooth, efficient, and personalized experience</b> while  using our services. This allows us to provide services and features that most  likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience  easier and quicker.</p>
    <p> To fully use our services, <b>you will need to register</b> using our online registration form, where you will be required to provide us with  your contact information (e.g. e-mail address, full name, mailing address) and.  We automatically <b>track certain information</b> about you based upon your  behaviour on our site. We use this information to do <b>internal research</b> on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and  serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an <b>aggregated  basis</b>.</p>
    <p> Using the Site's web server <b>log files</b>, we use IP addresses  to analyze trends, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personal  information. This information may include the URL that you just came from  (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether  this URL is on our site or not), what browser and operating system you are  using, your IP address etc.<br>
 In addition, <b>we use cookies</b> on certain pages of our site.  We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a  cookie. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your  interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies  are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at  the end of a session. The other type of cookie we use is a 'persistent' cookie.  This stays on your hard drive and we use this to automatically identify who you  are. We use this cookie so that you do not need to log in manually every time  you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personal  information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the  cookie to your personal information. We do this to allow us to let you know on  the homepage what has changed on the site since your last visit. We also use  the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our most loyal  users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,  although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site.  For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log in manually each time  you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember who you are. </p>
    <p> Some of our business partners use cookies and other tracking  technologies on our site. These are used to monitor site performance and to  measure site traffic and usage. We have no access to or control over these  cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Temando only and  does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h4>Surveys &amp; Contests.</h4>
    <p>From time-to-time our site may request information from users via  surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. newsletter). Participation  in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has  a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested  will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration)  and supplementary information on your professional interests, opinions and  preferences (e.g. choice of software, working practices, opinions on industry  issues, feedback on the Temando web site). We will use the contact information  to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site though on  request we will provide details of any winners' name and organisation. If the  survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by  entrants with the sponsor.</p>
<h4>Payment Processing.</h4>
    <p>In order to process payments online we require the billing address  for the credit card used and our external payment service provider, eWAY,  requires your credit card details. For details of how your information is used,  please see following section.</p>
<h4>Our Use of Your Information</h4>
    <p>We use personal information about you to improve our marketing and  promotional efforts, to <b>statistically analyse site usage</b>, to improve our  content and product offerings and to customise our site's content, layout, and  services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor  it to meet our users' needs.</p>
    <p> We use your <b>e-mail address</b> to send you newsletters or other  communications (for example, digests of the forum posts) that you have  requested from the Site. Out of respect for our users we offer an opt-out (see  4. below).</p>
    <p> We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other  information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to  resolve any disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At  times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes,  and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look  for users using multiple User IDs or alias.</p>
<h4>Payment Processing.</h4>
    <p>We take online payments for our online freight quoting and booking  service. We use eWAY as our external payment provider. In addition to the information outlined above, we require the billing address of the credit card  you use so that we can pass this to eWAY who check the address against the  cardholder's details for security purposes. eWAY requires that you provide your credit card details to process the  transaction. This is done on a secure eWAY server using SSL (secure sockets  layer). In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, Temando may be contacted for the sole purpose of performing further checks. These details are stored securely on an eWAY PCI Compliant (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) server in order to process future payments you may make, but eWAY does not use your information for any other purpose.</p>
    <p> Your Personal Information, which is not inclusive of full card details, is stored in our databases, which are  located in Australia. Please note that the information you enter may at some  time be transferred outside the country for the purposes of processing by  Temando or any of its affiliates. By submitting your information, you consent  to this transfer.</p>
    <p> Temando complies with each respective privacy act which is binding  in each of the countries it operates in.</p>

To Opt  out of other emails, you can change your preferences in the settings section  under my account. On this page you can define what e-mails you receive from the  site (if any) and save your settings.&nbsp;  However, you will still receive service related emails to perform the  function of the site. </p>
<h4>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h4>
    <p>Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we  cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal  information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this  Privacy Policy.<br>
    By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be  forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain  circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions  or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any  information about you to <b>law enforcement</b> or other government officials  as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection  with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other  activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.</p>
    <p> As a general proposition, <b>we do not sell or rent any personal  information about you to any third party for marketing purposes</b>.</p>
    <p> <b>Advertisers.</b> We do <b>aggregate</b> personal information and  disclose such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing  and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to  these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.</p>
    <p> <b>Legal Requests.</b> Temando cooperates with law enforcement  inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and  other rights. Local, and international law enforcement agents can request and  may receive your personal information.</p>
    <p> <b>Carriers and Other Service Providers.</b> From time to time we  use third party Carriers and Service Providers to facilitate our services. For  example, we will share your address with shipping companies, your credit card  number with credit card processors, and other personal information with  insurance, and Email service providers.&nbsp;  This is as necessary for the  third party to provide that service.&nbsp;  These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information  for any other purpose. </p>
    <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
    <p> This Web site contains links to other sites  that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other  sites.&nbsp; We encourage you to be aware when  you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web  site that collects personal information.&nbsp; </p>
    <h4>"Tell a  friend" services</h4>
    <p> Temando offers a service whereby you can e-mail site content (for  example, a particular forum post) to a friend or colleague. This will involve  entering the e-mail address of your friend. <b>We do not use the e-mail  addresses you enter for any purpose other than to send your e-mail</b>. We do  not store, rent or sell these e-mail addresses.</p>
    <h4>Control of Your Password</h4>
    <p> Except as specifically permitted by this section, <b>you may not  disclose</b> your Temando password to any third parties nor share it with any  third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial  control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding  actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised  for any reason, you should immediately change your password by visiting the  preferences page on the Site.<br>

    <h4>Data Retention</h4>
    <p> We will retain your information for as long as  your account is active or as needed  to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your  information to provide you services  contact us as described below. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with  our legal obligations, resolve disputes,  and enforce our agreements.</p>
    <h4>Reviewing and Changing  Your Personal information</h4>
    <p> You can <b>at any time review and change</b> the information you  submitted during registration by visiting the settings page on the site.</p>
    <p> You must <b>promptly update your information if it changes</b>.  Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our forums  or other message areas or the feedback area.</p>
    <p> <b>You can at any time ask to see and have removed  any information that we have stored on you, though we reserve the right to  charge for this service</b>. Please contact us if you would like your personal information  removed. We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove  in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and  enforce our User Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely  removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we  back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal  information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your  requests that it be removed.</p>
    <h4>Other Information  Collectors</h4>
    <p>Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy,  this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect  from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties,  whether they are other members of the Site or other sites throughout the  Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal  information you disclose to them.</p>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>In order to process and protect your credit card details, our  payment provider <a href="http://www.eway.com.au/" target="_blank">eWAY</a> uses SSL (secure  sockets layer) encryption. The secure server is hosted by <a href="http://www.eway.com.au/" target="_blank">eWAY</a> and not Temando.</p>
    <p> On the Temando site we use best endeavour to safeguard the  confidentiality of your personal identifiable information but we do not use  encryption (such as SSL) or firewalls to further protect the information as it  travels across the Internet. This is because we do not believe that, apart from  the credit card information processed by eWAY, the personal information we  currently collect warrants such measures and the accompanying loss of speed  experienced. You should be aware that "perfect security" does not  exist on the Internet.</p>
    <h4>Changes to Privacy  Policy</h4>
    <p>If we are going to use your personal information in a manner  different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via  email, prior to making such changes. You will have a choice as to whether or  not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make  any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user  information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice,  before changes go into effect, on our web site notifying users of the change.  In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted  to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy  practices.</p>
    <h4>Downloadable Software  Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>The privacy policy only covers only information that is collected  through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected  through software downloaded from the site.</p>
