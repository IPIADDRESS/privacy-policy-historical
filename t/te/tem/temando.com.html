In addition to the information outlined above, we require the billing address of the credit card you use so that we can pass this to eWAY who check the address against the cardholder's details for security purposes. eWAY requires that you provide your credit card details to process the transaction. This is done on a secure eWAY server using SSL (secure sockets layer). In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, Temando may be contacted for the sole purpose of performing further checks. These details are stored securely on an eWAY PCI Compliant (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) server in order to process future payments you may make, but eWAY does not use your information for any other purpose.</p>
