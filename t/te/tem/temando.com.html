<h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">We automatically<strong>&nbsp;track certain information</strong>&nbsp;about you based&nbsp;upon&nbsp;your online behavior on our website. We use this information to do<strong>&nbsp;internal research</strong>&nbsp;on our users' demographics, interests, and&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;to better understand and serve our users.

</ul><p class="MsoNormal">The above uses are necessary for the legitimate interests of gathering information for marketing, product and systems improvement, market analytics and the development of our business.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With your consent, we also use your&nbsp;<strong>e-mail address</strong>&nbsp;to send you newsletters, marketing&nbsp;and&nbsp;sales communications, or other communications (for example, digests of the forum posts) that you have requested from the Site. Out of respect for our&nbsp;users&nbsp;we offer an opt-out (see below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We also use information from or about you, including information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any disputes, prevent fraud, enhance security, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Master Services Agreement or Terms of Website.

<p class="MsoNormal">We take online payments for our online freight quoting and booking service. We use eWAY as our external payment provider. In addition to the information outlined above, we require the billing address of the credit card you use so that we can pass this to eWAY who check the address against the cardholder's details for security purposes. eWAY requires that you provide your credit card details to process the transaction. This is done on a secure eWAY server using SSL (secure sockets layer). In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, Temando may be contacted for the sole purpose of performing further checks. These details are stored securely on an eWAY PCI Compliant (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) server in order to process future payments you may make, but eWAY does not use your information for any other purpose.</p>
