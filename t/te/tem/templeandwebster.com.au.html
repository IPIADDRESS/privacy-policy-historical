  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Temple &amp; Webster.  We’re happy to have you here.<br>
    Temple &amp; Webster is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
  </p>
  
  <h2>About this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information we collect 
    from or about you, whether through the Temple &amp; Webster web site or by any other method.
  </p>    
  <p>
    By visiting and/or becoming a member of the Temple &amp; Webster web site you expressly consent to the collection, 
    use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, which forms part of the 
    <a href="http://www.templeandwebster.com.au/terms">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> of our web site.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    What information we collect, 
    and how we collect it
  </h2>
  <br>
  <strong>Personal information</strong>
  <br><br>
    <p>
      We collect personal information about you that you submit to us voluntarily through our web site or otherwise, for example when you 
      apply to become a member, when you make a purchase, when you update your ‘My Account’ details, when you fill in a form on our 
      web site or send us an email or letter, and when you enter a promotion or competition.
      This personal information may include (but is not limited to) your name, your email address, your postal and billing addresses, 
      your telephone number(s) and your payment information, which may include credit card details.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also request further optional information such as your date or year of birth, your gender and/or other demographic 
      information and your personal preferences. We may also collect personal information about you which you submit voluntarily by 
      posting a comment on our blog or on our Facebook page. We advise you to limit the personal information that you publish in this way, 
      since we cannot control any third party collection or use of any such information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also collect personal information about you through third parties, for example if we purchase access to a database to 
      which you have provided your personal information and consented to its disclosure.
    </p>
  <strong>Non-personal information</strong>
  <br><br>
    <p>
      We may collect non-personal information relating to your use of our web site.  This might include (but is not limited to)

      Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies using your web browser’s help files, 
      but this may affect the functionality of our web site and your ability to use our services.
