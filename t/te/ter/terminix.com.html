	<h3 class="darkest-gray">TERMINIX PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
	<p class="date-span">Effective Date: 11/01/2015</p>

		provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use, or continue to use, the products and services provided by Terminix
		and/or accessed through the Terminix Applications or offline (“Product(s)” and “Service(s)”). .</p>

		collection, use, disclosure, storage and transfer (including international transfer) of user information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy (as
		amended from time to time) and (ii) the Terminix Terms of Use hereby incorporated by reference <b>THIS PRIVACY POLICY AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND
			LIABILITIES UNDER THE LAW.</b>. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Terminix Applications or provide us with

	<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
	<p>We may collect different types of information, including, but not limited to, personal information, financial information, demographic information,
		log, Device (hereinafter defined) and aggregate data. Sometimes we collect combinations of all these types of information. In each case, when using the
		Terminix Applications, it is indicated on the Terminix Applications whether any personal or demographic data must be provided for you to access and use the
		Terminix Applications and/or purchase the requested Product or Service.</p>
	<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">CONNECTING WITH THE TERMINIX APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="darkest-gray thick text-uppercase">When You Register or Otherwise Contact Us.</span> When you provide us with information in connection with a
		particular activity or otherwise sign up for or order our Products and Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone
		number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business
		relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you about Terminix using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you
		have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact
		you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS)
		message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="darkest-gray thick text-uppercase">Registration Information.</span> We will collect personal information from you if you register with the
		Terminix Applications or place an order for our Products or Services, which may include, but is not limited to, name, address, phone number(s), email
		address(es), personal interest preferences, and any other information about you we consider relevant (“Personal Information”). You may not use a
		user/account name that is vulgar or otherwise offensive (as determined by Terminix), infringes any trademark or other proprietary rights of others, or is
		used in any way that violates the Terms of Use. Terminix reserves the right to deny, in its sole discretion, any user access to the Terminix Applications
		and/or our Products and Services without notice for any or no reason.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="darkest-gray thick text-uppercase">Financial Information.</span> Financial information is information that you provide to us, including your
		debit or credit card number and related billing information (collectively, the “Billing Information”). We require such financial information in order to
		process payment for the purchase of a Product or Service that you have requested. <b>By submitting your financial information, you consent to our
			providing it to those Authorized Third Party Service Providers (as later defined) as necessary to support and process your transactions as well as your
			credit card issuer/banking institution for their purposes. </b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>We ask that you do not enter financial information into your profile, except in the fields provided for that information.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="darkest-gray thick">FACEBOOK.</span> You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the Terminix
		Applications and/or our Products and Services or take advantage of other features of the Terminix Applications. When you comment on the Terminix
		Applications using your Facebook username and password and clicking “allow” on the Facebook permission authorization screen, we will automatically import
		whatever information that you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile based upon your privacy settings at Facebook, such as your location, your
		interests, etc. (collectively, “Permitted Facebook Profile Content”) and you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Permitted Facebook
		Profile Content, including syncing access to such Permitted Facebook Profile Content when you are not using Terminix Applications and we may share that
		information with other users. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials are conducted solely through Facebook.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="darkest-gray thick">USER-GENERATED CONTENT.</span> The Terminix Applications may contain review or chat areas and/or other message,
		communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Terminix Applications (the “Communication
		Services”). Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the
		property of, and is subject to redistribution by, Terminix. You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information
		in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when posting or otherwise participating on the Communication Services. If you post content,
		such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered
		users or visitors to that Terminix Application or Communication Services and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable
		information. We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services. We reserve the right
		to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate
		use of these Communication Services.
	</p>
	<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY</h3>
	<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a
		variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Terminix Applications, your
		browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our Product and Service providers to coordinate and record the
		activity and fill your requests for our Products and Services and information (“Usage Information”). We collect many different types of information from
		cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Terminix Applications, your operating system
		type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your
		device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device
		Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the Terminix Applications (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is
		automatically assigned to the Device used to access the Terminix Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may also
		collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Terminix Applications and the website you visit after you leave our Terminix
		Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or
		otherwise improve the Terminix Applications.</p>
	<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then
		transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s). These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.
		For example, when you visit Terminix Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s). Cookies allow us to recognize you when
		you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. A “cookie”
		is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the
		Terminix Applications. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with Terminix Applications with other information we store
		about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with Terminix Applications.</p>
	<p>
		Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. “Session” cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to
		manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. “Persistent” cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored
		on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
		information you have previously provided. “Flash” cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that
		may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect
		and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be
		used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to
		have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser
		settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management
		tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">here.</a> If you choose to disable cookies
		on your Device, some features of the Terminix Applications may not function properly. For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log
		into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.
	</p>
	<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the Terminix Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have
		performed specific actions. When you access the Terminix Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that
		action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the Terminix Applications and promotions.</p>
	<p>We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the Terminix Applications, such
		as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while
		you are connected to the Terminix Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
	<p>We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 is another form of collection,
		tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are
		not stored in browsers’ cookie files. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
	<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal
		Information. For example, we use information we collect about Terminix Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and
		usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we
		associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
	<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE ABOUT A THIRD PARTY</h3>
	<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Terminix Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide
		(names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that
		person or we explicitly say otherwise. If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all
		other customers or registered users. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Terminix Applications, your e-mail address
		may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
	<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM THIRD PARTIES</h3>
	<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as
		information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information, provided that such sources confirm to us that they are
		permitted to share such information, such information is publicly available or the collection is required or authorized by law. We use this information to
		help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, our Products and Services
		and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
	<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">Third Party Analytic Technologies</h3>
	<p>We use third parties’ analytic and tracking tools to better understand who is using the Terminix Applications, how people are using the Terminix
		Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the Terminix Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to
		you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to
		collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Terminix Applications, Device Identifiers, type
		of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited. They might combine information they collect from your interaction with Terminix
		Applications with personal information they collect from other sources. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other
		tracking technologies.</p>
	<p>
		If you wish to exercise choice with respect to collection and use of the data by these third party tools, you may visit: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Some of the analytic and tracking tools we use are Google Analytics and Google Analytics Advertising. The Google Analytics Advertising features we use
		include the following:</p>

		<span class="darkest-gray thick text-uppercase">Links to other Website(s) and Communities.</span> To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access
		external or third party website(s) and communities, you should be aware that these external or third party website(s) and communities are not controlled by

		do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the Terminix Applications, and you do so at your own risk.

		existing ones. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your Personal Information, you will know because the Effective Date of
		the Privacy Policy will change. By accessing the Terminix Applications and/or purchasing our Products and Services after the Effective Date, you are deemed
