		<p>When you request information about a product or service or register with one of our sites, we may need to know specific information about you. This enables us to process your registration/ requests and reply to your needs promptly.</p>

		<p>Our site’s registration and survey forms require users to give us contact information (like your name, e-mail and address) and demographic information (like your zip code, age or income level). We use customer contact information from these registration and survey forms to send you information about our company, promotional materials and information from our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.
