In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the Terminix Applications (any, a “Device”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the Terminix Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Terminix Applications and the website you visit after you leave our Terminix Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.  We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Terminix Applications.</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom">The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s).  These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.  For example, when you visit Terminix Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s).  Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.  They also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. A “cookie” is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Terminix Applications.  Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with Terminix Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with Terminix Applications.</p>
			<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.  “Session” cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.  Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser.  “Persistent” cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.  We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.  “Flash” cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">here.</a>  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Terminix Applications may not function properly.  For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.</p>
			<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the Terminix Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.  When you access the Terminix Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the Terminix Applications and promotions.</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom">We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the Terminix Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Terminix Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom">We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).  HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers’ cookie files.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom">In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about Terminix Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
			<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE ABOUT A THIRD PARTY</h3>
			<p class="margin-bottom">If you send someone else a communication from the Terminix Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Terminix Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
			<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM THIRD PARTIES</h3>

We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, our Products and Services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
			<h3 class="darkest-gray margin-top">Third Party Analytic Technologies</h3>
			<p class="margin-bottom">We use third parties’ analytic and tracking tools to better understand who is using the Terminix Applications, how people are using the Terminix Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the Terminix Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you.  Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Terminix Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited.  They might combine information they collect from your interaction with Terminix Applications with personal information they collect from other sources.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.</p>
