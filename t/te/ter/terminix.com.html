<p><strong>We ask that you do not enter financial information into your profile, except in the fields provided for that information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook.</strong>&nbsp; You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the Terminix Applications and/or our Products and Services or take advantage of other features of the Terminix Applications. &nbsp;When you comment on the Terminix Applications using your Facebook username and password and clicking "allow" on the Facebook permission authorization screen, we will automatically import whatever information that you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile based upon your privacy settings at Facebook, such as your location, your interests, etc. (collectively, "Permitted Facebook Profile Content") and you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Permitted Facebook Profile Content, including syncing access to such Permitted Facebook Profile Content when you are not using Terminix Applications and we may share that information with other users. &nbsp;The authentication of your Facebook login credentials are conducted solely through Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content. </strong>&nbsp;The Terminix Applications may contain review or chat areas and/or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Terminix Applications (the âCommunication Servicesâ).&nbsp; Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, Terminix.&nbsp; You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. &nbsp;There is no expectation of privacy when posting or otherwise participating on the Communication Services.&nbsp; If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that Terminix Application or Communication Services and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services.&nbsp; We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.&nbsp; Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Collected Through Technology</span></strong></p>
<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. &nbsp;As you use our Terminix Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our Product and Service providers to coordinate and record the activity and fill your requests for our Products and Services and information ("Usage Information"). &nbsp;We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. &nbsp;For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Terminix Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. &nbsp;Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (âDevice Identifierâ) for your computer or other device used to access the Terminix Applications (any, a âDeviceâ). &nbsp;A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the Terminix Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. &nbsp;We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Terminix Applications and the website you visit after you leave our Terminix Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. &nbsp;We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Terminix Applications.</p>
<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s). &nbsp;These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. &nbsp;For example, when you visit Terminix Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s). &nbsp;Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. &nbsp;They also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Terminix Applications. &nbsp;Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with Terminix Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with Terminix Applications.</p>
<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. &nbsp;âSession" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. &nbsp;Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. &nbsp;"Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. &nbsp;We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided. &nbsp;âFlashâ cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.&nbsp; Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.&nbsp; Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.&nbsp; You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.&nbsp; However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a target="blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.&nbsp; If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Terminix Applications may not function properly.&nbsp; For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.</p>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the Terminix Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. &nbsp;When you access the Terminix Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. &nbsp;These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the Terminix Applications and promotions.</p>
<p>We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the Terminix Applications, such as the links you click on. &nbsp;The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Terminix Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).&nbsp; HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.&nbsp; Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers' cookie files.&nbsp; To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about Terminix Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide About a Third Party </span></strong></p>
<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Terminix Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.&nbsp; If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users.&nbsp; Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Terminix Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information We Collect From Third Parties</span></strong></p>
<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.&nbsp; We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, our Products and Services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Analytic Technologies</span></strong></p>
<p>We use third partiesâ analytic tools to better understand who is using the Terminix Applications, how people are using the Terminix Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the Terminix Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you.&nbsp; Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Terminix Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited.&nbsp; They might combine information they collect from your interaction with Terminix Applications with personal information they collect from other sources. &nbsp;We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies.&nbsp; You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to review your options for opting out of their use of such devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Security.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.&nbsp; To guard your information delivered to us electronically, the Terminix Applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). &nbsp;SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the Terminix Applications, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.&nbsp; Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notice to California Residents.&nbsp; </strong>Customers residing in California who have submitted Personal Information to us may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. All requests for disclosure information must be submitted to us at <a href="mailto:terminixcares@terminix.com">terminixcares@terminix.com</a>. Within 30 days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties.&nbsp; As of the date of this Privacy Policy, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not respond to âDo Not Trackâ requests.</p>
<p><strong>A Note to International Users.</strong> &nbsp;The Terminix Applications are operated in the United States.&nbsp; If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.&nbsp; The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. &nbsp;By using the Terminix Applications or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.&nbsp; You are also consenting to the application of United States federal, and Tennessee state law in all matters concerning the Terminix Applications and this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy.</strong> The Terminix Applications are generally intended for general adult audiences and are not directed or intended for children under 13 years of age but Terminix does have some webpages accessible from our Terminix Applications which are intended for parents and educators to use with children under 13 years of age, such as HarrysBigAdventure.com.&nbsp; No personally identifiable information is collected from these webpages. &nbsp;We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 13 years of age on any of the Terminix Applications. &nbsp;If you are under 13 years of age, you should not register or provide Personal Information on the Terminix Applications. &nbsp;If we later obtain actual knowledge that a user who has provided Personal Information is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that userâs Personal Information from our systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy.</strong> &nbsp;We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. &nbsp;The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Terminix Applications, with the "Effective Date" posted at the top of the Policy. &nbsp;We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new Terminix Applications or Communication Services or change existing ones. &nbsp;If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your Personal Information, you will know because the Effective Date of the Privacy Policy will change. &nbsp;By accessing the Terminix Applications and/or purchasing our Products and Services after the Effective Date, you are deemed to consent to our then-current Privacy Policy for information captured after the Effective Date of that Privacy Policy. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disputes.</strong> &nbsp;If you choose to visit the Terminix Applications your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the laws of the United States, and the State of Tennessee.</p>
<p><strong>No Rights of Third Parties. </strong>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any Personal Information relating to users of the Terminix Applications.</p>

                                    <p>Ultimate Protection Guarantee (UPG) is specific to the termite or pest plan purchased. Consult your plan for specific terms and limitations that may apply. Not available in all areas. For complete offer terms, including coverage areas, or for details regarding any Terminix guarantee, call 1.800.TERMINIX (1.800.837.6464). If within 30 days after an inspection or treatment you arenât totally satisfied, we will refund the treatment or coverage charges, reimburse any prepaid services and cancel your plan. Termite plans require annual inspections and payments to be current. Termite plan UPGs vary by plan and type of termite. UPG IS AVAILABLE FOR QUALIFYING PROPERTIES ONLY. UPG IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR SERVICE PLANS. Any future treatments and/or damage repairs require the presence of live termite activity. Termite inspections are not intended as reliance for representations at real estate closings.</p>
