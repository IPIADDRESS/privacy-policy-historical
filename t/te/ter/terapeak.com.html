            <p>We use information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout and services to better meet the needs of users.

            <p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>
            <p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via internal or in-house surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postal or zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes and shared with the contest and survey sponsors. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. All payments are handled through PayPal or Beanstream</p>
            <p>We protect personal information and the user's right to privacy by:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Only collecting personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy statement.</li>
              <li>Ensuring appropriate security measures are in place.</li>
              <li>Ensuring appropriate confidentiality measures are in place for personal information when dealing with third party</li>
              <li>Ensuring that personal information is kept up-to-date and current for the purposes in which it is being used.</li>
              <li>Honouring any user request for access to their personal information.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.</p>
            <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. As well any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our users' information is protected.</p>
            <p><strong>Supplementation of Information</strong></p>
            <p>In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Credit Card</strong></p>
            <p>We do not conduct credit card validation as all credit card processing for our products and services is undertaken by PayPal or Beanstream.</p>
