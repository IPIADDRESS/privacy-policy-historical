Website and that third party Website may provide personal information about you
and your transactions back to Terapeak’s Website AERS Inc. does not sell or rent
any information collected from users to other third parties.</p>
<p>We create user accounts to tailor the information displayed to each
individual user and as applicable to the users.</p>
<p>The Website has specific sections available to all users and other specific
sections that may be accessed by members only.</p><h3>Profile</h3>
<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third
parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that
we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.
Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable
information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user.
This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Website and to direct
pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other
third parties.</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information
about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally
identifiable information while a user is on our site. We use both session ID
cookies and persistent cookies. Once users close the browser for the session ID
cookie, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file
stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent
cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
<p>We use cookies on certain pages of our site to help analyze our Website flow,
measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. We offer certain
features that are available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to
allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies may
also be used in the future to help us provide information that is targeted to
your interests. A user is always free to decline our cookies if their browser
permits, although in declining a cookie, you may not be able to use certain
features of our Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more
frequently during a session.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies and Web beacons on our site,
for example a tracking utility company. However, we have no access to or control
over these tracking technologies, once we have given permission for them to set
cookies or Web beacons for advertising and our internal tracking purposes.</p>
<p>We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) information and
provide information in a non-personally identifiable manner to other third party
marketing partners.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of tracking technologies by <a href="http://www.terapeak.com" title="www.terapeak.com">www.terapeak.com</a>
only and does not cover the use of tracking technologies by any third
parties.</p><h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard Website servers we use log files. This includes internet
protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to
analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and
gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not
linked to personally identifiable information such as your email address.</p><h2>Communications from the Site</h2>
<h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
<p>We send all new members a welcoming email. Established members will only
receive information on products, services, special deals, in a once monthly
newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to
not receive these types of communications (a user can opt out of the newsletter
in our "profile" section). You may also unsubscribe by following the
instructions included in each promotional email.</p><h3>Newsletter</h3>
<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact
information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy
we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and
Opt-out sections of the Terapeak.com Website to opt out of receiving these types
of communications.</p><h3>Service Announcements</h3>
<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related
announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for
maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of
these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these
communications are not promotional in nature.</p><h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services
and in regards to issues relating to their account. We reply via email or phone,
in accordance to the users wishes.</p><h2>Sharing</h2>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>With the exception of user obligations arising from existing relationships
with eBay and use of eBay services that may result in shared user information,
and although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith
belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial
proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Website.</p><h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>
<p>We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
advertisers.</p><h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
<p>We do not share Website usage information about users with third party
advertisers.</p><h3>Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties</h3>
<p>We DO NOT share personal information with third parties who are not service
providers.</p><h3>Third Party Intermediaries</h3>
<p>We use outside credit card processing companies - PayPal and Beanstream - to
bill users for services. Users are governed by terms and conditions of payment
as set by PayPal or Beanstream. The PayPal or Beanstream payment window appears
on the Terapeak.com Website. Please review their privacy policies for more
information on their practices.</p><h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We partner with other third parties such as a tracking utility company and a
live chat provider, to provide specific services. These third parties are not
allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of
providing these services and not for their own marketing purposes.</p><h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event that AERS Inc. goes through a business transition such as a
merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets,
personal user information will, in most instances, be part of the assets
transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Website for 30
days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If
as a result of the business transition, the user’s personally identifiable
information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of
collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes
section. We may disclose personal information of a user to an agent when in the
reasonable judgment of AERS Inc. the individual is seeking information as an
agent of the user.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, we may disclose personal
information of a user to a credit reporting agency.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information of a user to a public agency when in the
reasonable judgment of AERS Inc., there is imminent danger to person or property
to which such disclosure would avoid or minimize the danger.</p><h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
<p>We do not use our user’s information for purposes unrelated to our site. We
would like to continue to have the user's consent for the purposes and uses of
personal information as set out in this privacy statement, however, you as a
user may choose to refuse or withdraw your consent by refusing to give us
personal information or withdrawing such consent subject to any applicable
contractual or notice provisions by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@terapeak.com">support@terapeak.com</a>.</p>
<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional
communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following
instructions given in the footer of the email or emailing <a href="mailto:support@terapeak.com">support@terapeak.com</a>.</p><h3>Links</h3>
<p>This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AERS Inc.,
is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our
users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of
each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This
privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.</p><h3>Surveys &amp; Contests</h3>
<p>From time to time our site requests information from users via internal or
in-house surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is
completely voluntary and the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this
information. The requested information typically includes contact information
(such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postal
or zip code). Contact information will be used to notify winners and award
prizes and shared with the contest and survey sponsors. Survey information will
be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the user experience within the
Website. User’s personally identifiable information is not shared with third
parties as all surveys and contests are internal and or in-house.</p><h2>Security</h2>
<p>This Website takes every precaution to protect our user’s information. When
users submit sensitive information via the Website, their information is
protected both online and off-line. All payments are handled through PayPal or
Beanstream.</p>
<p>We protect personal information and the user's right to privacy by:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Only collecting personal information for the purposes set out in this
	privacy statement</li> <li>Ensuring appropriate security measures are in
	place</li> <li>Ensuring appropriate confidentiality measures are in place
	for personal information when dealing with third party</li> <li>Ensuring
	that personal information is kept up to date and current for the purposes in
	which it is being used</li> <li>Honoring any user request for access to
	their personal information</li>
</ol>
<p>When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information such as
credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best
encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as a
registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also
do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line for all of our
user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above. Only
employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a
billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to
personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept
up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are
added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on
privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our user’s information is
protected.</p><h2>Supplementation of Information</h2>
<p>In order for this Website to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is
necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from
3rd party sources.</p><h3>Credit Card</h3>
<p>We do not conduct credit card validation as all credit card processing for
our products and services is undertaken by PayPal or Beanstream.</p><h3>Purchasing History</h3>

<h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as name, postal
code, zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires
our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user’s
personally identifiable information. This can be done by going to the account
page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:privacy@terapeak.com">privacy@terapeak.com</a>.</p><h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy statement and or practices, we will post
those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem
appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use
information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information
was collected. The posting of changes to the privacy statement shall be
effective within 30 days of post.</p>
<p>If we are going to use personally identifiable user information in a manner
different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via
email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in
this different manner. However, if users delete/deactivate their account, then
they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this
new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy
practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we
will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users of the change. In
cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive
communications from us, to notify them of the changes in our privacy
practices.</p><h2>Contact Information</h2>

<p>Otherwise, we assume that we have you - the user of our Website and or
on-line services - consent to collect, use and disclose your personal
information for the purposes and uses identified in this privacy statement.</p>
