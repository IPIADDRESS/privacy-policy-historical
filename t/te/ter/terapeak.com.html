<b>Information Use</b><br>

We collect and use the information to process and deliver our online services, to facilitate the services requested by the user, to improve the services and features of the Web site, to customize our services or delivery of information to you on the Web site to make the users' use of the Web site more effective and efficient, to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems and enforce this privacy statement. We automatically track certain information based on the user's use of our Web site.  We use this information to do internal research on our user's demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand the users and our client base.  We track information regarding the URL that the user came from (whether from our site or not), which URL the user may go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser is being used and the user's IP address.</p><p>

We use information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout and services to better meet the needs of users. We collect information to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use only.  These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally identifiable information.  Personal identity is kept anonymous.</p><p>

We collect and use information from messages, users who chose to post information on our site.  We also collect and use personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send correspondence about your activities or postings on the Web site.</p><p>

We collect and use information if users register for <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> or another web site or use a web site providing a service for <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> that helps facilitate a user's activity on <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> and that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> or AERS Inc. does not sell or rent any information collected from users to other third parties.</p><p>

We create user accounts to tailor the information displayed to each individual user and as applicable to the users.</p><p>

The <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> site has specific sections available to all users and other specific sections that may be accessed by members only.</p><p>

<b>Profile</b><br>

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user.

Throughout the site, the user is identified by their email address.  Other AERS Inc. registered members will not be able to see any of another user's "Profile" information, unless the user chooses to show it from the community.  If the user selects to show his/her email address, the user will disclose their email address to other users and third parties.   As a result, other users or third parties may send the user unsolicited email and be able to personally identify your public activities on our site.  We do not use robot exclusion hardware and therefore, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect a user's email address from our site.  We also provide a number of ways to allow other users to find out more about you and your site activities, such as our "Member Search function".  These "Member Search function" type of functions only exist on our general forum.</p><p> 

<b>Cookies</b><br>

We use cookies on certain pages of our site to help analyze our Web site flow, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.  We offer certain features that are available through the use of a cookie.  We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.  Cookies may also be used in the future to help us provide information that is targeted to your interests.  Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.  A user is always free to decline our cookies if their browser permits, although in declining a cookie, you may not be able to use certain features of our Web site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.</p><p>

<b>Links</b><br>

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, AERS Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><p>

<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via internal or in-house surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postal or zip code).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes and shared with the contest and survey sponsors.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties as all surveys and contests are internal and or in-house.</p><p>

<b>Recommend Us</b><br>

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.  The friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@terapeak.com">support@terapeak.com</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.</p><p>

<b>Security</b><br>

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.  All payments are handled through PayPal (<a href="http://www.paypal.com">www.paypal.com</a> which uses military strength encryption for your protection.  When interacting with eBay directly, all transactions use a secure GeoTrust SSL certificate with 128 MB of encryption.</p><p> 

<b>We protect personal information and the user's right to privacy by:</b><br>

1.	Only collecting personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy statement.<br>
2.	Ensuring appropriate security measures are in place.<br>
3.	Ensuring appropriate confidentiality measures are in place for personal information when dealing with third party<br>
4.	Ensuring that personal information is kept up-to-date and current for the purposes in which it is being used.<br>
5.	Honouring any user request for access to their personal information.</p><p>

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.</p><p>    

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. As well any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, our servers are located in an access-controlled facility in Kelowna, B.C.  The servers are physically secured within a locked cabinet within the facility to ensure no unauthorized physical access. </p><p> 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to <a href="http://www.rackforce.com/">Rack Force</a> our hosting provider.</p><p>

<b>Supplementation of Information</b><br>

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p><p>    


<b>Credit Card</b><br>

We do not conduct credit card validation as all credit card processing for our products and services is undertaken by <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.</p><p>  

<b>Purchasing History</b><br>

We do not combine information about the purchasing habits of our users with other third parties.</p><p> 

<b>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</b><br>

We currently purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in.</p><p>  

<b>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</b><br>

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as name, postal code, zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the going to the profile page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@terapeak.com">support@terapeak.com</a>.</p><p>    

<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>

If we decide to change our privacy statement and or practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. The posting of changes to the privacy statement shall be effective within 30 days.</p><p>   

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.  In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p><p>   

<b>Contact Information</b><br>
