<b>Information Use</b><br>

We collect and use the information to process and deliver our online services, to facilitate the services requested by the user, to improve the services and features of the Web site, to customize our services or delivery of information to you on the Web site to make the users' use of the Web site more effective and efficient, to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems and enforce this privacy statement. We automatically track certain information based on the user's use of our Web site.  We use this information to do internal research on our user's demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand the users and our client base.  We track information regarding the URL that the user came from (whether from our site or not), which URL the user may go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser is being used and the user's IP address.</p><p>

We use information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout and services to better meet the needs of users. We collect information to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use only.  These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally identifiable information.  Personal identity is kept anonymous.</p><p>

We collect and use information from messages, users who chose to post information on our site.  We also collect and use personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send correspondence about your activities or postings on the Web site.</p><p>

We collect and use information if users register for <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> or another web site or use a web site providing a service for <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> that helps facilitate a user's activity on <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> and that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> or AERS Inc. does not sell or rent any information collected from users to other third parties.</p><p>

The <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">Terapeak.com</a> site has specific sections available to all users and other specific sections that may be accessed by members only.</p><p>

<b>Profile</b><br>

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user.

Throughout the site, the user is identified by their email address.  Other AERS Inc. registered members will not be able to see any of another user's "Profile" information, unless the user chooses to show it from the community.  If the user selects to show his/her email address, the user will disclose their email address to other users and third parties.   As a result, other users or third parties may send the user unsolicited email and be able to personally identify your public activities on our site.  We do not use robot exclusion hardware and therefore, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect a user's email address from our site.  We also provide a number of ways to allow other users to find out more about you and your site activities, such as our "Member Search function".  These "Member Search function" type of functions only exist on our general forum.</p><p> 

<b>Cookies</b><br>

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while a user is on our site.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p><p> 

We use cookies on certain pages of our site to help analyze our Web site flow, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.  We offer certain features that are available through the use of a cookie.  We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.  Cookies may also be used in the future to help us provide information that is targeted to your interests.  Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.  A user is always free to decline our cookies if their browser permits, although in declining a cookie, you may not be able to use certain features of our Web site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.</p><p>

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site, for example advertisers.  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising.</p><p>

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by <a href="http://www.terapeak.com">www.terapeak.com</a> only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p><p> 

<b>Log Files</b><br>

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.  This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.  IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service.  We use a tracking utility called Awstats to track and interpret log files and to analyze user movement.</p><p>

<b>Newsletter</b><br>

<b>Service Announcements</b><br>

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.

Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postal or zip code).

We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.  The friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@terapeak.com">support@terapeak.com</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.</p><p>

All payments are handled through PayPal (<a href="http://www.paypal.com">www.paypal.com</a> which uses military strength encryption for your protection.  When interacting with eBay directly, all transactions use a secure GeoTrust SSL certificate with 128 MB of encryption.</p><p>

5.	Honouring any user request for access to their personal information.</p><p>

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.</p><p>    

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. As well any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, our servers are located in an access-controlled facility in Kelowna, B.C.  The servers are physically secured within a locked cabinet within the facility to ensure no unauthorized physical access. </p><p>
