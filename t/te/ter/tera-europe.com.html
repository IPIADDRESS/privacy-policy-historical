	        <section><h2>Data Privacy Policy</h2><div class="hr"></div><p class="bodytext">Version-Nr.: 1.2 from May 27th 2010<br><br>Frogster Online Gaming GmbH – the company on whose website this data protection policy is displayed - strives to offer you excellent service for all products and support. We respect your right to privacy and would therefore like to inform you about how we handle your private data.<br><br>1. General information<br><br>For many internet users the protection of private data is of great importance and a fundamental part of a satisfactory internet experience. Frogster Online Gaming GmbH pays great attention to questions and doubts customers and other visitors to our website may have concerning data protection, and we observe the applicable data protection laws and rules of the EU.<br><br>Please note that our website contains hyperlinks (‘links’) to other websites. For these other websites Frogster Online Gaming GmbH disclaims any liability with regard to data protection, statements on data protection and any other contents.<br><br>Please consult our special instructions for voice chat.<br><br>2. Data that we collect, save and process about you<br><br>The following section will give you an overview of the personal data that we collect, save, and process about you.<br><br>We never collect personal data which relates to racial and ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical worldviews, trade union membership, health, or sexual orientation.<br><br>2.1 Data which you knowingly and explicitly provide us with<br><br>You can explicitly and knowingly make personal information available to us and agree for us to gather it in the following cases:<br><br>Email queries (in particular requesting information or support)<br><br>On our website (as well as within our products) are links which you can use to send us emails in case you have questions, if you want information or material, or if you want to make comments or suggestions. You also have the opportunity to contact our staff for information about our products and services. In order to deal with your request we may require private data such as your name and phone number.<br><br>Registration:<br><br>If you request one of our products or one of our services we will require some data to be collected from you. Various types of private data such as your name or email address will be collected depending on the product or service. Details can be seen on the form present on the registration site.<br><br>Payment:<br><br>When paying for fee-based functions, virtual currency, or other fee-based goods or services we will gather personal information from you such as address, bank details or credit card details in order to process and make payments more secure.<br><br>Communication:<br><br>You can communicate with other people on our websites and within our products using a pseudonym. If you do not want your communications to be traceable to you we advise you select a pseudonym which can in no way be linked to you personally. We reserve the right to save all communication including communication using more transient methods such as chat channels.<br><br>2.2 Statistical data relating to your visit<br><br>Our computers automatically collect data if you visit our website or use our products (‘usage data’). We keep statistics about the number of visitors to our website, the geographical location of the user, the date and time of the visit, the pages visited, the domain the visitor uses to access our websites, and the browser the visitor uses.<br><br>We will potentially register, save and evaluate the actions you undertake within our products. This includes observing playing patterns and checking for manipulation within game operation in particular which may be used to uncover improper player conduct. In order to do this we also use special programs.<br><br>We may also display statistics regarding your activities and successes on our websites or within our products which will be visible along with the pseudonym you selected at registration or when creating your character. If you do not wish this information to be traceable to you by other players and related persons we advise you to choose a pseudonym that can in no way be linked to you personally.<br><br>This statistical data will only be matched to your personal details if it is necessary to prevent or uncover wrongdoing or a breach of our rules. In all other cases the information will solely be evaluated anonymously and then deleted within a certain timeframe. The statistics help us to improve the efficiency of our websites and products.<br><br>2.3 Use of Cookies<br><br>We use cookies only in the way as described in this paragraph. A ‘cookie’ contains information which is sent from our website to your browser; this subsequently stores the information on your system. If cookies are used, our website can ‘memorize’ information about you and your settings, either until you close the current browser window (temporary cookies), or until you disable or erase the cookie.<br><br>We only employ ‘cookies’ in the following situations. The first situation applies to temporary cookies which we employ in two cases. If you use one of our online applications, our web server automatically sends a temporary cookie to your browser to facilitate navigation on our website. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a route selector to help our software identify which page to display if you click the ‘back’ button in your browser. The cookie is erased as soon as you close the current browser window. If you are guided to our website via one of our business partners, our web server also sends a temporary cookie to your browser which contains a ‘source code’ relating to this business partner. We use this data for statistics and marketing purposes.<br><br>If you are a licensee of Frogster Online Gaming GmbH and go to a domain of the website with admission control, we set a temporary cookie for the connection to state that you have been authenticated. These cookies contain random data that the server uses to authenticate the browser’s request to the server within the session. The cookies do not contain any data with which you can be identified personally. The cookie is erased as soon as you close the active browser window.<br><br>The second situation in which we use cookies is requests for product information, documents, services or other enquiries in the course of your visit to our website. If you fill in a form you can choose if our website may send a cookie to you local hard disk (insofar as your browser is not set-up to always accept cookies of this variety). In this case it is not a temporary cookie, but you can disable it at anytime using your browser settings. If you do not wish to accept this kind of cookie you can still use our website. However you can save time by accepting this kind of cookie because there is no need to refill in forms and/or make repeat a visit to our website. Even if you accept this kind of cookie, you can set your browser at anytime to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. Thus you always have the choice whether to accept the cookie or not.<br><br>3. How we treat the collected private data and who we pass it on to<br><br>Your private data is used for the purposes listed below:<br><br>3.1 Sending replies<br><br>We usually respond to all electronically sent questions, requests for product information and services and other enquiries. We store this correspondence for the purpose of improving our products, our service, our website and for own business affairs.

This may occur in particular if the duties and responsibilities within the group of companies are changed during a restructuring, for example to improve service quality or the optimization of internal processes. These affiliated companies will also use this data within the framework of these data privacy regulations.<br><br>4.
