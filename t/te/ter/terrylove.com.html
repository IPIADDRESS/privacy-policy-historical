        web site is pretty low tech.&nbsp; We give out information on plumbing
        and remodel.&nbsp; It's not my&nbsp; intention to collect&nbsp; customer
        information.&nbsp; I do collect informtion when an order is
        placed.&nbsp; You do want me to know where to send it, right?&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love Plumbing &amp; Remodel is strongly
        committed to protecting the privacy of all its customers. We have
        written this privacy policy to inform you of the information collection
        and use policies of the Love Plumbing &amp; Remodel web site, such as
        the specific information that we collect from you, how we use this
        information, and what options you have in sharing this information with
        us when you visit our site. Protecting your privacy is a significant
        part of Love Plumbing &amp; Remodel's commitment to providing you with a

<span class="normal">We collect personally identifiable information only when an
order is placed on-line with
your permission. You maintain control over the information
we record.&nbsp; We do not sell customer
lists to anyone. The order data is stored in a location designed specifically
to ensure that there is no access to either the server or its data contents by
unauthorized individuals.<br>

<p><a name="Cookies"><b><font face="Times New Roman">Cookies</font></b></a></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The only place this site uses cookies, is when you have entered the
order entry shopping
area of our site, we use "cookies" (a small file stored on your hard
drive) to store your purchase selections. Specifically, cookies allow you to view the
current&nbsp; shopping order, that is what you have placed in your cart.
Cookies do not contain any registration information that would personally
identify you.&nbsp; They only track what items are in your shopping cart.&nbsp;
They do not record credit card numbers.&nbsp; Our cookies don't track your usage of other web sites or the Internet. If you restrict
or disallow cookies through your web browser, you will be unable to use the
shopping cart to place an order in that way.&nbsp; However, you can
always phone in an order or fax the order.&nbsp; <a href="order.htm">Ordering

        <font face="Times New Roman"><a name="Secure"><b>Secure connections</b>.<br>
        Love Plumbing &amp; Remodel uses secure connections during the shopping
        Checkout, which means that information is encrypted before it is sent
        over the Internet between your computer and Love Plumbing &amp; Remodel
        computers. You can verify that the connection is secure because you will
        see a key or a padlock at the bottom of your browser that indicates a
        secure connection. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL
        (or web site address): the address will change from <br>
        http://www.easycarts.net/ecarts/terrylove/</a>&nbsp; to <br>
        https://secure.easycart.com/easycarts/public_html/ecarts/cgi-bin/terrylove/</font><a name="Secure"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        when a secure connection is in place. Once your information arrives at
        Love Plumbing &amp; Remodel, your credit card number is stored in an
        encrypted file on a machine that is separated from the site's Internet
        connection by a firewall. This firewall is designed to protect
        information from anyone viewing, stealing or otherwise accessing. We use
        commercially reasonable technological means to prevent occurrences of
        third party access.</font>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">More than likely you probably already
        transmit your credit card number electronically every day. When you
        swipe your credit card at the local store, your card information is
        encrypted and transmitted over a phone network. Using your card on a
        secure online Web site is very similar - your information is encrypted
        and then transmitted over a high-speed network line.</font></p>
