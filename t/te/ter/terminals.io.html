("Evolve PR Inc." or "we" or "us"), the Evolve Termina Apps and subsites [*.evolveterminal.com] (the "Site"), and the terms which govern the collection and use of information you provide to us whether via the Site or otherwise.  By accessing or using the Site and/or providing any personal information to us, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these practices, you must not access or use the Site or provide us with your personal information.

                Personal Information
            </h3>
            <p>
                In describing the information we collect, the term "personal information" refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, company name, phone number, email or postal address.  In many cases we need this information to provide the products or services that you have requested.  Unless necessary to provide our products and services, the amount of personal information that you choose to disclose to Evolve PR Inc. is completely up to you.  The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us.  In order to process certain transactions, we may also need to collect payment information from you (e.g., credit card information) which will not be shared with anyone outside of Evolve PR Inc., its affiliates and the financial institutions and vendors used to process payments.  We do not intentionally collect any sensitive information, such as information concerning race, religion, health, sexual orientation or political beliefs.  Please do not send any sensitive personal information to us.

                Voluntary Information
            </h3>
            <p>
                We receive and store any information you voluntarily communicate to us in connection with your use of our Site or which you may voluntarily communicate to us in any other fashion.  You may choose not to provide certain information we request from you.  However, if you so elect, we may not be able to provide our products and services, and you might not be able to access or take full advantage of the features and functionality of the Site.  Once you initiate a voluntary transaction, we will ask you for certain information depending upon the nature of the transaction in question.  For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you request to create an account, we ask for your name, e-mail address and your location.</li>

                <li>When you have signed up and if there is an offer to send a welcome package, we may ask you for your phone number and mailing address</li>
                <li>When you participate in social actions or discussions on the Site, any information posted in these areas of the Site becomes public information, and you should exercise care when disclosing personal information.</li>
            </ul>

                Our products and services may be provided using affiliates and other resources located in various countries around the world, including those outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), that may not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that do not have an adequate level of data protection.
