			<h1>Copyright Notice &amp; Privacy Policy</h1>
			<h4>All contents copyright Terracotta, Inc. All rights reserved.</h4>
			<p>"Terracotta" and the "Terracotta" insignia, as well as all other distinct logos and graphic symbols signifying Terracotta on this web site are trademarks of Terracotta, Inc. All other trademarks referenced are those of their respective owners.</p>
			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>This Privacy Policy explains our practices with respect to
			  our use and collection of personally-identifiable
			  information that we collect from you (a) in the course of
			  your use of the Terracotta web site accessible at
			  URL <a href="http://www.terracotta.org/">http://www.terracotta.org</a>
			  (the "Site"); (b) during any registration process that may
			  be required for Terracotta software access. Please note that
			  this Privacy Statement is limited only to your browsing and
			  operation of the Site, and to your registration.</p> 
			
			<p>From time to time, we may amend our Privacy Statement by
			  posting a revised statement at this URL. If we amend our
			  Privacy Statement in a manner that materially alters our
			  treatment of your personally-identifiable information, we
			  will make reasonable efforts to notify you through the
			  e-mail address you submit to us, so that you will have an
			  opportunity to learn about our new privacy practices.</p>

			<p>We last updated this Privacy Statement on August 12, 2008.</p>

			<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> We use the term
			  "Personal Information" to refer to information that would
			  permit someone to identify or contact you, such as your full
			  name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal
			  Information does not include anonymous, aggregated
			  information that, by itself, does not permit the
			  identification of individual persons. For example,
			  statistics about the use of the Site (such as the number of
			  visitors to our site last month) are not Personal
			  Information.</p>

			<p><strong>Browsing Our Web site: What We Collect and How We
			    Use It.</strong> While you browse the Site, we may collect
			  two types of information from you: (a) "Subscription
			  Information," which you volunteer to us by completing and
			  submitting a subscription form field built into our Web
			  pages; and (b) "Other Information," which is collected
			  automatically as you browse the Site, and which under some
			  circumstances may be personally-identifiable.</p>

			<p><strong>Subscription Information.</strong> Throughout the
			  Site, there are several form fields that you may use to
			  subscribe to specific programs offered by Terracotta,
			  including mailing lists and other forms of periodic
			  electronic communications. These form fields may include our
			  "Partner Signup" and "Events Signup" forms. Completing one
			  of these forms generally involves the submission of an
			  e-mail address and the selection of a subscription
			  option. We may use this e-mail address to send you further
			  communications about the program that you selected.</p>

			<p><strong>Other Information.</strong> When you browse the
			  Site, our servers may automatically collect certain
			  information about you and your use of the Site, which we use
			  to perform statistical analyses of the frequency and sources
			  of page requests. This merely enables us to better
			  understand who is using the Site, how it is being used, and
			  allows us both to maintain the operation of the Site and to
			  create improvements. Ordinarily, most of this information is
			  not personally-identifiable, but under certain circumstances
			  it might be combined with, or linked to, your
			  personally-identifiable information. While so combined or
			  linked, this Other Information will be considered to be
			  Personal Information.</p>

			<p><strong>Browsing Information.</strong> Our servers
			  automatically collect the following information about your
			  Web browsing session: (a) the unique Uniform Resource
			  Locator (URL) of each Web page that you request; (b) the
			  date and time of each page request; (c) the HTTP response
			  code of the page request; and (d) the IP address from which
			  each Web page request was made. An IP address is a number
			  that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use
			  the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same
			  from browser session to browser session, but if you use a
			  consumer dial-up Internet access provider, your IP address
			  probably varies from session to session.</p>

			<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small pieces of
			  information stored on your own hard drive, not on our
			  Site. They are used by our servers to maintain your user
			  session, the purpose of which is to provide you with access
			  to certain areas of the Site that are available only to
			  authenticated users. You are always free to decline our
			  cookies if your browser permits you to do so, but if you do,
			  those restricted areas of the Site will be unavailable to
			  you and certain other portions of the Site may not work
			  properly.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Registering with Us: What We Collect and How We Use
			    It.</strong> After you download and install software from
			  us, registration forms may appear as part of the setup
			  process. When you register, you are presented with a
			  registration form that you must complete and submit to us in
			  order to receive access. We refer to the information that
			  you volunteer as part of this registration form as "Customer
			  Registration," which may include your real name, your
			  company and title, a company Web site URL, a mailing
			  address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, and a user
			  name and password. From time to time we may modify our
			  registration form to add or delete certain information; you
			  will be able to tell exactly what we collect by accessing
			  the latest version of the registration form.</p>

			<p>We use the Registration Information for several purposes:</p>

			<p>(1) to identify you and grant you access to certain parts of
			  the Site, which will allow you to download certain
			  Terracotta Software;</p>

			<p>(2) to take reasonable measures to prevent the Terracotta
			  Software from being downloaded to destinations
			  restricted under U.S. export control law;</p>

			<p>(3) to evaluate your interests and allow our sales and
			  marketing representatives to communicate with you
			  through a variety of means, which may include e-mail,
			  direct mail, and telephone calls about Terracotta
			  products, services, and other items likely to be of
			  interest to you, or to solicit feedback about our
			  products and services from you; and</p>

			<p>(4) to improve our products and services by better
			  understanding our customers.</p>

			<p><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We will not knowingly sell
			  lists of your Personal Information to third parties for
			  their marketing purposes. However, under certain
			  circumstances we may share your Personal Information with
			  third parties. We may grant access to your Personal
			  Information to our independent contractors to the extent
			  necessary for them to maintain, enhance, or add to the
			  functionality of the Site, our application software, or our
			  other services. Although Terracotta currently does not have
			  a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other
			  companies under common control (collectively, "corporate
			  affiliates"), it may have corporate affiliates in the
			  future. Terracotta may share your Personal Information with
			  its corporate affiliates. If Terracotta is acquired by
			  another company, that company will possess the Personal
			  Information collected by Terracotta and it will assume the
			  rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information
			  as described in this Privacy Statement. Finally, we may
			  share your Personal Information with certain of our
			  strategic business partners that we believe may offer
			  solutions beneficial to the Terracotta user community. When
			  we do share such Personal Information with those selected
			  strategic business partners, those business partners will be
			  obligated to honor this Privacy Statement.</p>

			<p>Please note that we cannot fully ensure that your Personal
			  Information will not be disclosed to third parties in other
			  situations. For example, we may be legally obligated to
			  disclose information to the government or other third
			  parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may
			  circumvent our security measures to unlawfully access data
			  on our servers. Additionally, in the unlikely event that we
			  need to investigate or resolve possible problems or
			  inquiries, we can, and you expressly authorize us to,
			  disclose any information about you to law enforcement or
			  other government officials as we believe necessary.</p>

			<p><strong>Exercising Choice.</strong> When you sign up through
			  a subscription form field or register with us, you agree to
			  receive communications relating to the Terracotta products
			  and services from us. If you later decide that you do not
			  wish to receive further communications from us, you may
			  contact us to be removed from our lists. To be removed from
			  our electronic or direct mail subscription lists, send an
			  e-mail to unsubscribe@terracotta.org, specifying in your
			  e-mail whether you wish to stop (a) electronic
			  communications; (b) direct mail communications; or (c)
			  both.</p>

			<p>We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request
			  within five (5) business days after receiving your
			  communication. Even after you have been removed from our
			  subscription lists, however, we may contact you for
			  non-marketing purposes related to your use of the Terracotta
			  products and services, such as for technical reasons or to
			  solicit feedback.</p>

			<p><strong>Updating Your Subscription Information.</strong> If
			  you wish to update your contact information on one of our
			  subscription lists, you may send an e-mail to
			  changeaddress@terracotta.org.</p>

			<p><strong>What We Do to Secure Your Information.</strong> We
			  store data on servers located behind our firewall, in order
			  to protect against the unauthorized access to or compromise
			  of information contained on our servers, such as your
			  Personal Information. However, you should know that in the
			  present technological environment, no security measures are
			  perfect, and that neither we nor any other Internet site can
			  fully eliminate these security risks.</p>

			<p><strong>Further Questions?</strong> Our mailing address is
			  650 Townsend Street, Suite 325; San Francisco, California
			  94103; USA. We may be reached by telephone at
			  415.738.4000. If you have any questions about this Privacy
			  Statement or the data privacy practices described in it,
			  please feel free to contact us at privacy@terracotta.org or
