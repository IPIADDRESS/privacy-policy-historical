<p align="center"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">NCR's Position on Privacy and Data
Protection<br>
</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As a leading producer of customer transaction solutions, NCR has
long been concerned about protecting personal information it gathers about its employees
and customers. NCR (as a member of the national trade association for the information
technology industry - now ITI) adopted its first set of privacy principles in 1971.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">NCR also considers data protection a customer satisfaction issue. We
seek to meet all customer expectations in our solutions, products and services-and in our
business practices. We will meet the customer demand for privacy protection.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">NCR believes that individuals have the right to be informed about
the information being collected about them and about its intended use. People should also
have the right to "opt out" if they do not wish to have personal data used for
other purposes. They should also have the right to review information being retained and
the means to update and correct it.<br>
</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Our Web Site</font></b> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">When you visit us at www.ncr.com we want you to feel secure that NCR
is respecting your privacy. In fact, the only private information we have about you is the
information you choose to give us by filling out a form or providing feedback. We do not
give that information to third parties without notifying you on the form and getting your
consent.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We may use "cookies" on some pages of our site, simply to
help us serve you better each time you return. A cookie is a small element of data that a
Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The data collected from cookies helps us determine how many people
visit this site and what pages they view. We use this information to better serve all
visitors as we improve our site content and design. You can set your Web browser to warn
you before you accept a cookie.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We do collect information on the domains from which people visit us.
Again, we use that data to track trends in our site traffic and as the basis for making
improvements. We do not share this information with any third parties.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">NCR is committed to protecting personal data on this site just like
we are committed to helping our customers protect <i>their </i>customers' privacy. NCR
realizes it is in a unique position to deliver the capability for protecting personal data
to its customers and is moving aggressively to provide this protection in its data
warehousing, data mining, retail, financial and Internet solutions.&nbsp; <a href="http://www3.ncr.com/press_release/pr100598.html">NCR is the first company to apply
the principles of consumer data protection to its data warehousing solutions.</a><br>
