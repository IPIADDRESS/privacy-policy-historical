<h3 id="info-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h3>

<p>The information we collect depends on which service you use and how you use them. We collect two types of information; “personal information” that identifies you as a specific individual and “non-personal information” that doesn’t. The particular kinds of personal and non-personal information we collect usually depend on how you interact with us. The controller of the personal information collected is En Masse Entertainment, Inc., 1218 3rd Ave. Suite 800, Seattle, WA. 98101, USA.</p>

<h4>A. Information You Give Us Directly</h4>
<p>We collect information you provide us, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your email address and password;</li>
<li>Security questions and answers;</li>
<li>Billing information such as your name, address, telephone number, payment card number, and payment account details;</li>
<li>Information you provide when seeking help from us such as your nickname or user-number and records of the issues you experience;</li>
<li>Demographic details, for instance in response to surveys about our services; and</li>
<li>Information you provide to enter a contest or sweepstakes. If you win, we may need to collect your social security number, postal address and/or national identification for eligibility, prizes delivery and tax purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you participate in social features (such as chat), the information that you disclose is public information. We may store and access it, and it may be read, copied, collected or used by other users without your consent. Please make sure your privacy settings reflect your preferences.</p>

<p>When you participate in online multi-play games, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics are visible to all. We may record your gameplay, including your controller button inputs, and replay these together with your profile information and game statistics to other players in-game without further notice to you, for example as part of a spectator mode, or for out-of-game promotional purposes.</p>

<h4>B. Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services Automatically</h4>

<p>We collect information automatically when you use our services, including:</p>
<ul>

<li>IP address,</li>
<li>Data during our game play, and</li>
<li>Device event information, including crash reports and system activity details (e.g. whether you encountered an error playing our games or lost Internet access).</li>
</ul>

<p>We also may collect information locally on your device, using mechanisms like Session Info such as keys for login, google analysis cookies, and application data caches.</p>

<p><strong>Other Third Parties</strong>. We may receive your account information from third parties, like Facebook, when you use these services in connection with our services. We also may receive information from third parties to supplement the information we receive from you. We use information from these companies primarily to help us deliver relevant advertising and sending newsletter to you. We also may use information from third parties, for instance, to help us understand your approximate geolocation via your IP address for tax purposes, or to customize certain services to your location, and for fraud and/or abuse prevention purposes.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-collect">2. How We Collect Information</h3>

<p>We collect information from you when you provide it to us directly, such as via an online form on our website or when you summit your support ticket to our CS team through http://support.enmasse.com/games. And also we and third parties use certain technologies described below to collect information to deliver excellent experiences.</p>

<h4>A. Cookies and Other Similar Tracking Technologies</h4>
<p>Cookies are small text pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping purposes and stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your purchased records, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly and otherwise help enhance your user experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or the guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences.</p>

<p>We use other technologies for similar purposes as a cookie. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud and enforce our User Agreement.</p>

<h4>B. Analytics Technologies</h4>
<p>We use our own game servers and internal and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our services, your device and the health of our services.</p>

<p>For instance, En Masse may collect and store data from your device when you use our services. This information includes technical and related information about your device info (such as operating system information and IP Address), information about your feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics. If you participate in online services, En Masse also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.</p>

<h4>C. Advertisement Serving Technologies</h4>
<p>Some of our services employ advertisement serving technologies that use cookies and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you. The ads can be tailored to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or if you express interest in a game, you might be offered an advertisement later for that game or similar services on En Masse or 3rd party’s web sites.</p>

<p>The 3rd parties’ services via their web sites collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>

<p>These technologies of the 3rd parties collect and use information so we can serve appropriate advertising to you and help track results and measure effectiveness. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
<li>Domain type, IP address; and</li>
<li>Advertisement response for target marketing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3rd party companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an ad to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected across their websites. </p>

<p>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third party targeted advertising, you can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank"> https://www.networkadvertising.org</a>, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">https://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>, <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank">http://youradchoices.ca/</a>, or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; it just means that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<h4>D. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies</h4>
<p>En Masse strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you log in to one of our services, set up an En Masse Account or make purchases, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes.
