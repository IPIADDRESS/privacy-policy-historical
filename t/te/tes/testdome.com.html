<h1>Uses Made of the Information</h1>
<p>
We use information held about you in the following ways.
</p>

<h3>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>
The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>").

<p>
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
