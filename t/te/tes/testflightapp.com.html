Like many websites, we may also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.

When you upload mobile applications (“App(s)”) to the Website, we may also record certain information related thereto, such as the number of times you install an App, the number of Apps you have access to, the number of times you view an App’s description, and whether you try to install an App without being authorized to.
