<br><br>
When you visit the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit a website. This information may include, but is not limited to, your computer or device’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Website and information you search for on our Website. Like many websites, we may also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Website; and we use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how you interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Website. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Website or all functionality of our services. 
<br><br>
When you upload mobile applications (“App(s)”) to the Website, we may also record certain information related thereto, such as the number of times you install an App, the number of Apps you have access to, the number of times you view an App’s description, and whether you try to install an App without being authorized to. It is important to note that we cannot install your Apps on our devices as each App is encrypted and protected and may only be opened by authorized devices.
