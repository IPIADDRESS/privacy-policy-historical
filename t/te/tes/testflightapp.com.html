This Privacy Policy applies to the Burstly website at www.Burstly.com, (the "Site"), the SkyRocket service (“SkyRocket”) and Burstly Mobile Services (collectively, “the Services”).

Personal information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the characteristics and activities of users of the Services, from which any personal information has been removed. This Privacy Policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information or of non-personal information.</p> <p>We receive and store personal information you choose to enter through the Services, or provide us in any other way, such as by telephone or by electronic mail. For example, when you register for our services, we collect personal information about you. This information may include your name, e-mail address and telephone number. We may combine the information that you submit on our Site with information about you that we receive from other online and offline sources in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the overall quality of our services.</p> <p>We utilize cookies to automatically collect information about visitors to our Site. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that reside within your browser to enable our computer systems to recognize your browser and to tell our systems how and when pages within our Site are visited and by how many people. The cookies from our Site do not collect personal information; however, we may combine information collected through certain cookies we issue on our Site with other personal information that you provide to us on the Site. <a href="http://www.burstly.com/cookies">View our cookies policy here.</a></p> <p>We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images used on our Sites or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and activity on the Site and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p> <p>We automatically receive and store certain other types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using, where you travel within the Site, and the page to which you link from the Site. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many customers as possible.</p> <p>We also may collect information in connection with our Mobile Services provided to publishers and advertisers as described below in the Burstly Mobile Services section of this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>How Do We Use the Personal Information That We Collect?</strong></p> <p>We use the information we collect to provide the Services and to better understand what products and services are of interest to our users.

Examples of these services include e-mail to you and analyzing data. While these agents and service providers may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Burstly, they may not use such information for any purpose other than providing such services to Burstly.</p> <p>• Protection of Burstly and Others: It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for the Company to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. Additionally, we may disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.</p> <p>• Corporate Transfers and Financings: In the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p> <p><strong>How Secure Is the Personal Information That You Provide to Us?</strong></p> <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

If you are a publisher using the Mobile Services, we may access, index, and cache requests made from your mobile sites, applications and device platforms to our system, including by automated means. In the course of providing these Mobile Services, we collect aggregate data from publishers' sites and use such data for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to, providing publishers, advertisers and others with aggregate information about traffic and site usage in our advertising network.</p> <p>We also collect certain information about visitors to publishers' sites that connect to the Mobile Services. We will automatically collect and receive information about those visitors such as, but not limited to, browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device type, carrier provider, IP addresses, unique device ID, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited and clicks on advertisements we display. We may track that information over time and over multiple publishers' sites and use non-personally identifiable information collected from such visitors to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to your visitors. In some cases, the mobile phone service providers for mobile devices may send visitors' phone numbers to Burstly. We use such information to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and technologies and we may also use this data to display advertising customized to visitors' interests and preferences. We do not use such information for telemarketing, to contact any individuals or to share with any third parties for their own use. In addition, we may collect personal information directly from customers on behalf of advertisers and periodically transfer such information to such advertisers.</p> <p><strong>Burstly Rewards</strong></p> <p>Burstly also delivers to users offers from third party advertising partners that allow users to earn rewards within participating mobile applications. By interacting with these offers some of those advertising partners may be able to collect information such as, but not limited to browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device type, carrier provider, IP addresses, unique device ID, carrier user ID, geo-location information and clicks on advertisements.

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@burstly.com">legal@burstly.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p> <p><strong>California Residents - Do Not Track Notice</strong></p> <p>Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) features. We interpret the DNT feature to apply to third party tracking on a website. Since we do not allow third parties to track users on our Sites for purposes of advertising, we take no action when we receive a DNT signal.</p> <p><strong>Changes</strong></p> <p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to this Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.
