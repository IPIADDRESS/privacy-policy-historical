  <h2>
      How we protect personal data
  </h2>

      <p>
          We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data. This section sets out some of the measures we have in place:
      </p>

       <ul>
  
<li>We apply physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal data;</li>
<li>We protect the security of your information while it is being transmitted by encrypting it;</li>
<li>We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption to keep this data safe; </li>
<li>We only authorise access to employees and trusted partners who need it to carry out their responsibilities;</li>
<li>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we carry out penetration testing to identify ways to further strengthen security;</li>
<li>We will ask for proof of identity before we share your personal data with you; and</li>
<li>We will reveal only the last four digits of your payment card number when confirming an order.</li>

  
  
  </ul>
  
  <p>
      Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, it is important that you keep your login details and devices protected from unauthorised access.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").  It may also be processed by companies operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers.  If we do this we ensure that your privacy rights are respected in line with this Policy. The most common way we do this is to put in place a specific type of contract, a copy of this type of contract can be found <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm" target="_blank" ontouchstart="">here</a> or through an approved scheme such as the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank" ontouchstart="">Privacy Shield</a>.
</p>

<h2>
    How long we use personal data for
</h2>
  <p>
      We will not keep your personal data longer than we need to, how long this is depends on several factors, including:
  </p>
      <ul>
<li>	Why we collected it in the first place;</li>
<li>	How old it is;</li>
<li>	Whether there is a legal/regulatory reason for us to keep it; </li>
<li>	Whether we need it to protect you or us.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>What types of cookies do we use?</h2>
      <p>We use the following categories of cookies:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>	<strong>Session cookies</strong> – These enable your web browser to remember which pages on our Site have already been visited and what actions have been taken in a session. Session cookies allow users to be recognized within a website so any page changes or item or data selection you do is remembered from page to page. The most common example of this functionality is the shopping cart feature of any e-commerce site. When you visit one page of a catalogue and select some items, the session cookie remembers your selection so your shopping cart will have the items you selected when you are ready to check out. Without session cookies, if you click CHECKOUT, the new page does not recognize your past activities on prior pages and your shopping cart will always be empty. Session cookies do not collect information from the user s computer.
