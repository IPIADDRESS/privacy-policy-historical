		<h2 id="phishing">Phishing and Credit Card Fraud</h2>
		
		<p>The scam of phishing, so called because it entails putting out a lure or an invitation to 'hook' unsuspecting credit card holders, may come in the form of letters, emails or phone calls. Credit card fraud has increased exponentially around the world and criminals are becoming ever more inventive in a bid to gain access to financial details. It's estimated that billions of people globally have been affected by such scams.</p>

		<p>A common phishing scam starts with an email message that says AOL, eBay, PayPal or any other well-known service with financial capability has encountered an error with the user's account. The email will contain a link that directs the user's Web browser to a Web site that, to all intents and purposes, appears authentic. Once you're on the fake site, you're invited to enter your logon name, password and possibly a credit card number - that's all they need to hijack your account.</p>

		<p>There’s no reason for alarm. It's not difficult to protect yourself against this practice, but it takes a certain amount of discipline.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Never open an email if you don't know the source. It doesn't matter how tempting the subject line is, don't click on something if you don't recognise the sender. Make it clear to anyone who has access to your computer to follow this rule closely.</p> </li>

			<li><p>Never give your details out over the phone if someone calls claiming to be from your bank. Ask the caller for their name and contact details and call the bank to verify their details.</p> </li>

			<li><p>Upgrade your Web browser to safeguard your details. Be aware though that this is not a fail proof tactic and nothing can replace your own diligence.</p> </li>

			<li><p>Buy good virus protection software and make sure that it's upgraded on a regular basis.</p></li>
 
			<li><p>When it comes to your credit card, be organised, be alert and be aware of the dangers. Read up on the latest scams to hit the internet and always question any form of communication about your card, no matter how safe the source appears. If anything appears suspicious, call the institution concerned before answering the communication.</p></li>
		</ul>
