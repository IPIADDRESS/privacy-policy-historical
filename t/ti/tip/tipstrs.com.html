As our business evolves, Snowbound may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal and anonymous information may be one of the assets transferred.</p>

<p>We may disclose information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with legal process served on Snowbound, or to protect the property or interests of Snowbound, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public.
