   <h1 class="subpages">Basic Privacy Policy</h1>
   <p class="normal">It is the strict policy of Tips.Net and Sharon Parq Associates, Inc., that
   personal information, such as your name, postal
   and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential.</p>
   
   <p class="normal">Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure
   location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only for the
   purposes for which you provide the information (such as to reply to your
   request or to handle your complaint). For example, when you subscribe to a
   newsletter,
   the information you provide is used to process your subscription.</p>

   <p class="normal">If at any time you would like to add or remove your name from
   any of our subscription lists, correct your information, or question how
   any information
   is used, you can send a personal e-mail to allen (at) sharonparq.com.</p>

   <p class="normal">&nbsp;<br><b>No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information</b><br>
   Our computers are not set up to track, collect or distribute personal
   information about visitors to this site. They do recognize the home server of
   visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which
   Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses
   or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the
   particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal
   purposes by our staff.</p>

   <p class="normal">Our computers also recognize the site where a visitor linked to our site,
   but we cannot identify you, the visitor, or your address. Site information is
   used to verify the effectiveness of marketing efforts for our newsletters and products.
   It may also be used to advise interested parties of the number of visitors who come to our
   site from their sites. No personal information is collected.</p>

   <p class="normal">In addition, we track information about the visits to the various parts of our Web site.
   For example, we compile statistics that show the number of
   visitors to our site, the daily requests we receive for particular files on,
   and where those requests come from. These
   aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to our visitors
   and may also be provided to others. These statistics provide an overview of how visitors
   use our site, but contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such
   information.</p>
			
   <p class="normal">&nbsp;<br><b>No Release of Information to Third Parties</b><br>
   Personal information that you have entrusted to our care will not be released to
   third parties, except as necessary to fulfill a service you have requested. For instance,
   if you order a product from us, your payment information may be verified with
   a financial institution, and your e-mail or postal address will be used to send you the product.
   We will also release your personal information if required in a judicial or governmental
   investigation or proceeding.</p>

   <p class="normal">There are no other circumstances under which we will provide or sell personal
   information to third parties, with one exception. If you provide us permission to share
   your e-mail address with others, we may do so, at our discretion. In this case, your
   address is stored in a "sharing list" that is separate and distinct from the newsletter
   subscription lists. You always have the opportunity to remove your name from our
   "sharing list," if you so request. We honor such requests promptly and fully.</p>

   <p class="normal">We will not share our newsletter subscription lists with others, period. We will
   not sell, distribute, post, copy, or otherwise disseminate your subscription e-mail
   address or other personal information to others.</p>

   <p class="normal">&nbsp;<br><b>Collection of Information by Third Parties</b><br>
   The Tips.Net network relies on third parties to provide some of the advertising you see on our
   sites. Information collected by those third parties, if any, is covered by those parties'
   privacy policies and is beyond the ability of Tips.Net to monitor or control. For instance,
   some third parties may collect information about your browsing preferences or habits. That
   information is not collected or maintained by Sharon Parq Associates, Inc. Contact information
   for the third parties we use is availabe upon request to allen (at) sharonpart.com.</p>
