Article 26 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his or her consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. <br><br></span><span style="font:12px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; "><br></span>
