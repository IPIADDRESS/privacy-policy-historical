</p>

</li>
<li>
<h5>5. Storage of Personal Information and Security</h5>
<p>We take reasonable precaution to protect the personal information we collect from you and other visitors. When you submit personal information via the Service, the information is housed in a secure in-house database. In order to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, and to maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we maintain. We use industry-standard technology, such as firewalls, in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.

<li>
<h5>7. California Privacy Rights</h5>
<p>
Residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as co-sponsors or advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
<p>
Company qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you may opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that have received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to privacypolicy-usa@gcrest.com. For such requests, you must put the statement “Privacy Policy Request” in the subject field of your email. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping. We will not accept requests via mail, telephone or by fax. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
</li>
<li>

Certain types of personal information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as birth date or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the new information. Note that we reserve the right to terminate or delete any registration or promotional entry if we believe the personal information submitted was knowingly false or fraudulent.</p>
<p>
Depending on which Service your register for, Company may not be able to change registered information such as gender, nickname or user ID. If you wish to change these details, please re-register. Where applicable, you can change your email address, password, date of birth, and hometown by logging into the Service and changing your registered information and/or profile information on the settings page or equivalent. Unless otherwise described above, to review, update, correct or delete your personal information collected by the Service, please email us at privacypolicy-usa@gcrest.com. </p>

<h5>10. Notification of Changes</h5>
<p>
If we decide to change our Policy, we will post those changes on our Policy page and/or within the relevant Service so you are aware of what personal information we collect from customers, prospective customers, and visitors to the Service, and when and how such information is collected, used and safeguarded. You are responsible for periodically checking for changes to this Policy.

</li>
<li>
<h5>11. No Guarantees</h5>
<p>
While this Policy states our standards for maintenance of personal information and we will make efforts to meet them, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards.

In addition, we will delete any records of such personal information that come to our attention.</li>
	<li>
