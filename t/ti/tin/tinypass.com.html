<h2>TinyPass Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Effective as of November 7, 2011</h3>
<br>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>We take your privacy and the privacy of our TinyPass website very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn
    more about how TinyPass LLC ("TinyPass," "we," our," or "us") treats information, including personally identifiable
    information when you visit our website located at http://TinyPass.com (this "Site"). We provide this Privacy Policy
    because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances
    under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy,
    please contact us via email at support@TinyPass.com or in writing at: TinyPass Privacy Concerns, 105 Hudson Street,
    Suite 401, New York, NY 10013.</p>

<p><b>Online Privacy Standards.</b>
    We follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices Principles,
    currently available at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm.</a>
</p>

<p><b>What This Policy Covers.</b>
    This policy covers the ways in which TinyPass treats information, including personally identifiable information,
    which we obtain when you use the TinyPass Service (as defined in our <a href="/terms" title="Consumer Terms of Use">Consumer Terms of Use</a>). We
    regard
    personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such
    as your real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use
    internally to identify you as a user in our system is not considered personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p><b>What This Policy Does Not Cover.</b>
    This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as the
    practices of Publishers (as defined in our Terms of Use *link*), third-party payment processing services, or our
    business partners and advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other
    sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of TinyPass and they have their own privacy
    and security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before
    submitting any personal information to them.
</p>

<p><b>Types of Users.</b>
    There are two types of users of the TinyPass Service: Publishers and Viewers. Publishers create accounts at
    http://TinyPass.com, and use the TinyPass Service to make their content available to Viewers. Viewers use the
    TinyPass Service to purchase and view content made available by Publishers. Viewers may elect to create user
    accounts if they choose. Unless the context of this policy makes clear the type of user (Publisher or Viewer)
    referenced by the, the term "you," as used in this policy, refers to both Publishers and Viewers.
</p>

<h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>

<p><b>Information Publishers Provide During Account Creation</b></p>

<p><b>Registration Information For Publishers.</b>
    During the process by which Publishers register for a user account, we require that the Publisher provide its name
    and email address. We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address. If you
    are a Publisher and choose to receive payments by check, you will also need to provide your physical mailing
    address. You will also choose a User Name that we will use to identify you in our system. In order to meet
    "Know-Your-Customer" ("KYC") banking mandates or Anti-money-laundering ("AML") legislation or similar purposes),
    TinyPass may be required to request additional information to verify Publisher's compliance with the Terms and
    Conditions agreed to as part of the registration process. For more information, please refer to the Publisher
    Registration Terms and Conditions.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Access To Your Personal Information.</b>
    In general, we make it easy for Publishers to view the personally identifiable information we have collected from
    that Publisher. That information is available at the Publisher's user account page, where Publishers can add, edit,
    or delete such personally identifiable information as the Publisher sees fit.
</p>

<h4>Optional Information You Provide</h4>

<p><b>Surveys and Contests.</b>
    Your participation in contests or surveys offered by and through the TinyPass Service is entirely optional. Should
    you choose to participate in a contest or survey, we may collect personally identifiable information from you as a
    condition of that participation. If you do not wish to disclose the requested information, please do not participate
    in the contest or survey for which it is required.
</p>

<p>Information Provided By Viewers Before Viewing Content</p>

<p>
    Viewers must provide TinyPass with a valid email address to view content provided through the TinyPass Service. In
    addition, when selecting paid content, Viewers will be presented with the option to establish a TinyPass user
    account or to pay for Publisher Services (as defined in the Terms of Use *link*) on a one-time-transaction (e.g., a
    la carte) basis.
</p>

<p>
    If you choose to create a TinyPass user account, we require that you provide your name and email address. We will
    send you an email to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address. You will also be required to
    provide payment information (e.g., PayPal account information) that can be used to purchase content through the
    TinyPass Service. TinyPass will never store your password for any third-party payment processing services.
</p>

<p>
    If you choose to create an account using a credit card, TinyPass will collect your credit card number; expiration
    date; name on the credit card; card security code, zip/postal code; and physical address.
</p>

<p>
    f you choose to pay for the content on a one-time-transaction (e.g., a la carte) basis, you will be required to
    provide payment information (e.g., PayPal account information) that can be used to complete that purchase. Because
    the TinyPass Service allows you to replay content you have purchased (subject to the terms selected by the Publisher
    of such content) we will also create a temporary account in our system that will allow you to access the content in
    accordance with its terms. Once the temporary account is no longer useful, we will schedule this temporary account
    and all information associated with the temporary account for deletion.
</p>

<b>Editing / Deleting Account Information.</b>

<p>
    Any user who establishes a TinyPass user account (whether a Publisher or a Viewer) can view the personally
    identifiable information we have collected from that user. That information is available at the user's account page,
    where users can add, edit, or delete such personally identifiable information as the user sees fit. To completely
    delete your account and accompanying personal information, please contact us at support@TinyPass.com.
</p>

<h4>Information We Do Not Collect From Any Users</h4>

<p><b>Children.</b>
    As explained further in our Consumer Terms of Use and Publisher Terms of Use (available at
    http://tinypass.com/terms), you must be 18 years of age or older – or, if you are under the age of majority in your
    jurisdiction, have the consent of your parent or guardian – to use the TinyPass Service. Therefore, we do not
    knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children. In accordance with Federal Children's Online
    Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), TinyPass will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally
    identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age. If you believe that we have
    information from or about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us by email at support@TinyPass.com or write
    to our Privacy Officer at the address noted above.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Social Security Number.</b>
    We do not require your social security number to use the TinyPass Service or to access any part of our site.
    TinyPass will never ask for your social security number except in the course of required tax documentation prior to
    publisher payments.
</p>

<h4>Information We Track</h4>

<p>
    <b>Log Files.</b>
    Similar to many websites and internet services, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically
    and store it in web server log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet
    service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this
    information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, and gather aggregate information about our
    user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from
    which individual user identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable
    information. Of course, if you complete transactions through the TinyPass site, we will collect and track payment
    information so that we can properly pay our publisher partners.
</p>

<p><b>Cookies.</b>
    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. It can also help us
    understand how our site visitors click to our site, what pages they view during their visit, and their account and
    preference information as users of the TinyPass Service. Similar to many websites, the TinyPass Service stores an
    encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back without requiring you to log in each
    time. Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on
    our site. Cookies used by TinyPass do not include your personally identifiable information
</p>

<p>
    If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your web browser software to disable them. To do so, please refer
    to the help section of your specific browser for more information on how to manage or disable cookies. Please note
    that your browser must be configured to accept cookies to use the TinyPass Service.
</p>

<h4>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h4>

<p>
    <b>In TinyPass Communications.</b>
    We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our website as our primary means to inform our users of important
    service and promotional announcements.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Service-Related Announcements.</b>
    When a Publisher establishes an account at http://TinyPass.com, we use the email address provided during account
    creation to deliver important service-related announcements to that Publisher. Examples of service-related
    announcements include: email verification during registration, requests for password reset, important security or
    server maintenance updates, upgrades, and new releases, or policy changes. These service-related announcements are
    considered a fundamental part the TinyPass Service, and Publishers cannot opt-out of these email announcements.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Promotional Announcements.</b>
    In order to improve the experience for our users, we will offer you the ability to sign up for optional email
    communications, such as regular updates from TinyPass. These communications are enhancements to our service and are
    entirely optional. We will ask for your consent before sending you promotional communications, and will make it easy
    for you to unsubscribe from these communications either through the emails themselves or though your account
    management options page.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Refer A Friend Program.</b>
    If you choose to use our referral tool to tell a friend about the TinyPass Service, we will ask you for your
    friend's name and email address. At your request we will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting
    him or her to visit this Site. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email, and to
    track the success of our referral program only. TinyPass will not use this email address for any other purpose.
</p>

<h4>On Our Website</h4>

<p>
    <b>Identification Of Publishers By User Name.</b>
    When Publishers enable Viewers to pay for Publisher Services using the TinyPass Service, such Publisher Services
    will be identified by the Publisher's User Name, Publisher's legal name or Publisher's popularly recognized name. In
    making Publisher Services available for purchase using the TinyPass Service, Publishers are not required to provide
    or publicize any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Site Statistics.</b>
    As noted above, we use information collected from our web log files to calculate and publish anonymous,
    non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our users are interested in viewing. For example, we may track
    and publish the total number of users who have viewed a Publisher Service. We publish this data in aggregate form
    only, and do not tie it to any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p><b>For Internal Reporting and Analysis</b></p>

<p>As noted above, we use information gathered from log files and cookies to improve our site, analyze trends,
    administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and to gather aggregate information about our user base
    as a whole. We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.</p>


<h4>HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</h4>

<p><b>With Third-Parties</b></p>

<p>We share your personally identifiable information, i.e. user name and email address, with Publishers that use the
    TinyPass Service to make their content available to Viewers. We do so because when a Viewer purchases content from
    one of our Publisher partners they are in effect acting as a customer of the Publisher. Your data is co-owned with
    the Publisher and TinyPass. </p>

<p>Occasionally we share anonymous, non-personal, aggregate information about our user base with partners or
    advertisers, and we may publish these aggregate usage statistics on our website for the interest of our users. We do
    not tie this shared or published data to the personally identifiable information of any person.</p>

<p><b>Linked Services.</b>
    In some cases, we allow you to access or link to other web services through our website. We also allow you to pay
    for Publisher Services using the TinyPass Service using selected third party payment processing services (e.g.,
    PayPal). We make it easy for you to determine when you are accessing or linking to these other web services through
    our website. In all of these cases, those sites may choose to collect your personal information as they deem
    appropriate. As noted above, we are not responsible for or in control of how third parties collect, use, or disclose
    your information obtained through these linked services. We encourage you to be aware when you are using these third
    party services and, for your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting
    any personal information to them.
</p>

<p><b>As Necessary In Certain Legal Circumstances</b></p>

<p><b>Legal Requirements.</b>
    We reserve the right to disclose your information, including personally identifiable information, when we have a
    good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is necessary to (a) comply with
    any law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce this Privacy Policy, including
    investigation of potential violations of this Privacy Policy, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
    security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of TinyPass, its users,
    or the public as required or permitted by law.
</p>

<p><b>Acquisition.</b>
    If TinyPass becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, including
    bankruptcy, our assets, including user information, may be transferred to a third party. At that time, your user
    information may become subject to that third party's privacy policy. Before we transfer your user information, we
    will notify you either by email or by posting a prominent notice on our site, and we will remind you of your ability
    to add, edit or delete your personally identifiable information from your account management options page in advance
    of any such transfer.
</p>

<h4>HOW WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE</h4>

<p><b>Security of Account Information.</b> Publisher's account information is password-protected. </p>

<p><b>Network Security.</b>
    We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard and secure your personal information while stored on our
    computer systems. We have implemented a variety of industry standard encryption and security technologies and
    procedures to protect your information, including your personal information, stored in our computer systems from
    unauthorized access. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
    storage, is 100% secure, thus we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information,
    but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

</p>

<p><b>Management Procedures.</b>
    We also maintain industry standard physical and electronic procedural safeguards that limit access to your
    personally identifiable information to our employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality
    agreements) who, through the course of standard business activities, need to access your personally identifiable
    information.
</p>

<p><b>Receiving Communications.</b>
    If you subscribe to any optional promotional communications, you will be able to unsubscribe from these
    communications through your account management options or through the emails we send you.
</p>

<p>
    If you agree to share personally identifiable information with any third party, you acknowledge that TinyPass does
    not control and shall not be responsible for any use of that information. TinyPass may facilitate the sharing of
    your personal information with your consent or request, but information shared with any third party is then subject
    to separate agreement between you and the third party.
</p>

<h4>UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

<p>
    From time to time, we will review and may make changes to our privacy policy. When we do so, we will notify you
    either by email or place a prominent notice on our website. The most recent version of our privacy policy is always
    available from a link on our homepage, and at http://TinyPass.com/terms.
