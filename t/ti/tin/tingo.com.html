                    <p>
                        We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number,
                        and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct
                        on our site, as well as to process any refunds due to a rebooking such as a price
                        drop or ‘Money Back’ event. An example of a money back event on Tingo is when you
                        book a room that's designated as a Money Back room, we'll regularly check prices
                        at that hotel for the exact room type and dates you book—and if we find that the
                        total price of your reservation has dropped, we’ll automatically rebook you for
                        free at the lower price! Plus, we'll keep scanning for lower prices until just
                        before your stay, to make sure you always pay the lowest price on Tingo. Once you’ve
                        completed your trip, we’ll refund you all the savings within a few days of check out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide
                        you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation
                        and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills, providing travel
                        notifications, and emailing you about money back events; to communicate with you in
                        general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve
                        our products, services, and website; to notify you about special offers and products or

                        <b>Email Communications.</b> We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of
                        travel-related opportunities on our website. One way we do this is by sending you
                        email messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests.
                        For example, if you search for a  a hotel in New York on our website or otherwise not yet
                        booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel
                        itinerary or about a  hotel in New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about
                        New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on
                        a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel
                        offers or other destination information. We believe these email messages will provide you
                        with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site.
                        Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages

                        to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content

                        with relevant content and information. To do this, we may, through cookies and other technologies, collect
                        information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or
                        hotels. We use this information, together with other information we have collected about you, to serve you
                        with ads, on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you
                        search for a hotel in Florida on this site, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on this site or
                        on another website you visit.

                        tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this website, by
                        clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">here</a> or

                        ads, you will still see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.

                        (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on
                        our sites; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact
                        with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by
                        these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display
                        advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.

                        covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which

                        so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email
                        address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our

                        information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent
                        unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.
