Accordingly, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time that Information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll indicate when those changes will become effective. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">How do we collect and use information?</h1><p class="static-t-text">Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Account Information</h2><p class="static-t-text">If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your Social Networking Services (“SNS”) Accounts (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth, zip code and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Other Information that You Provide to Us</h2><p class="static-t-text">We may also collect information, including PII and non-PII, if you send us an email or other communication, including the contents of that email or other communication.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</h2><p class="static-t-text">Like many website owners, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p><p class="static-t-text">“Web Beacons” (also known as clear gifs or) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information Related to Use of the Services</h2><p class="static-t-text">Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Location Information</h2><p class="static-t-text">In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as where you provide us with your address or other location information, but also by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h1><p class="static-t-text">We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information Shared with Our Services Providers</h2><p class="static-t-text">We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information Shared with Third Parties</h2><p class="static-t-text">We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</h2><p class="static-t-text">Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h2><p class="static-t-text">We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p><h2 class="static-t-list-heading static-l-heading">Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request</h2><p class="static-t-text">We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as Cause Owners or social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">Information You Choose To Share</h1><p class="static-t-text">As indicated above, this Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services.  Our Services also enable you to share information, including information about you.  If you are an Account holder, you will have a profile page on the Services.  For certain information, you can choose what information you wish to share in your profile via the Account Settings page of your Account, although certain information, such as your Tiltify username, will always be shared.</p><p class="static-t-text">If you are a Cause Owner or Campaign Sponsor, the online Cause or Campaign pages you publish will be publicly available on the Internet.  There are no private or hidden Tiltify Cause or Campaign pages.  Your activity is public.</p><p class="static-t-text">If you make a Contribution to a Cause or Campaign, you will have the option to elect to publicly display your support, including your name, the amount of your Contribution and a message of support.  Alternatively, you will be able to label your donation as “Anonymous” but still show the amount of your Contribution and a message of support, by clicking the “Anonymous” checkbox during the Contribution process.  Note that the total amount of Contributions received for a Cause or Campaign will be publicly available and so any Contribution you make will be included in this figure.</p><p class="static-t-text">Regardless whether you choose to make your donation “Anonymous” to the public, your information will be shared with the benefiting charity to enable the charity to acknowledge your contribution.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">The Security Of Your Information</h1><p class="static-t-text">We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">Links to Other Sites</h1><p class="static-t-text">Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">Modifying Your Information</h1><p class="static-t-text">You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account via your Account. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, you can click on the “Delete Account” button in your Account. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.  In addition, as stated in the Terms, if you establish a Cause or Campaign using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you cannot delete your Cause or Campaign after that date.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">International Transfer</h1><p class="static-t-text">Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">Our Policy Toward Children</h1><p class="static-t-text">Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p></section><section><h1 class="static-t-heading static-l-heading">Questions?</h1><p class="static-t-text">Please contact us at <a class="login-t-link" href="mailto:contact@tiltify.com?subject=Privacy Policy">contact@tiltify.com</a>  and please put “Privacy Policy” in the subject line, if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p></section></div></div><nav class="s-gray"><div class="banner-l-container"><ul class="footer-l-social-list footer-s-social-list footer-t-social-list"><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tiltifyTV"><i class="fa fa-youtube fa-fw"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/tiltify"><i class="fa fa-facebook fa-fw"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreTiltify"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://instagram.com/tiltify"><i class="fa fa-instagram fa-fw"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/tiltify"><i class="fa fa-twitch fa-fw"></i></a></li></ul></div></nav><footer class="s-dark-gray"><div class="footer-l-container"><div class="footer-l-column-container"><div class="footer-l-column-item"><h2 class="footer-l-headline footer-t-headline">Contact Us</h2><ul class="footer-l-list footer-s-list footer-t-list"><li><a class="js-footer-contact-link" data-uv-trigger="contact" data-uv-type="Charity Signup" href="#">Charity Signup</a></li><li><a class="js-footer-contact-link" data-uv-trigger="contact" data-uv-type="Press Inquiries" href="#">Press Inquiries</a></li><li><a class="js-footer-contact-link" data-uv-trigger="contact" data-uv-type="Business Inquiries" href="#">Business Inquiries</a></li><li><a class="js-footer-contact-link" data-uv-trigger="contact" data-uv-type="Contact Us" href="#">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="/pages/jobs">Jobs</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-l-column-item"><h2 class="footer-l-headline footer-t-headline">Campaigns</h2><ul class="footer-l-list footer-s-list footer-t-list"><li><a href="https://tiltify.com/start_campaign" rel="new-event">Create a Campaign</a></li><li><a href="/explore" rel="Explore">Find Campaigns</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-l-column-item"><h2 class="footer-l-headline footer-t-headline">More Tiltify</h2><ul class="footer-l-list footer-s-list footer-t-list"><li><a href="/pages/about-us">About Us</a></li><li><a href="/pages/how-it-works">How Tiltify Works</a></li><li><a class="js-footer-contact-link" data-uv-type="Support" href="#">Support</a></li><li><a class="js-footer-contact-link" data-uv-type="Feedback" href="#">Feedback</a></li><li><a href="http://info.tiltify.com/">FAQ</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-l-column-item"><h2 class="footer-l-headline footer-t-headline">Tiltify Tweets</h2><div class="twitter-l-container"><div class="twitter-timeline-container" data-chrome="nofooter noheader noborders noscrollbar transparent" data-link-color="#99ff00" data-theme="dark" data-tweet-limit="2" data-widget-id="486916968092401665" height="300"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-l-container s-darker-gray"><div class="footer-l-legal-container"><div class="footer-l-logo footer-s-logo"><a href="/" title="Tiltify"><div class="footer-l-logo-img"><img alt="Tiltify Logo" height="110" src="/assets/tiltify-footer-logo-d4ae7aa05e60439691b32357160e6617.png" width="245"></div></a></div><div class="u-tac"><ul class="footer-l-legal-list footer-s-legal-list"><li>© 2014 All Rights Reserved.
