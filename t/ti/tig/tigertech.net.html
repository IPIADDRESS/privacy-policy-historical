<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

We're aware of the growing concern of Internet users regarding the
widespread distribution of their personal information. This privacy policy
describes how we collect and use such information.
<p>


<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Personal Information</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

We request personal information (such as your name, address, and e-mail
address) if you sign up for one of our domain name or Web hosting
services. We do not request, collect or store personal information if
you merely browse our Web site or search for available domain names.
</p><p>

If you choose to sign up for a domain name, your contact information
may be made available to the public via the WHOIS system (this happens
with any domain name registration company and is required by ICANN).
We use a
<a href="http://support.tigertech.net/whois-privacy">privacy-enhanced version of your contact information</a> for this
purpose where possible, but that's not guaranteed and there are some
restrictions. If privacy is a concern, you may wish to use
valid but less revealing contact information (such as a post office
box address, work address and phone number, etc.) when you sign up
with us.
</p><p>

We may provide your contact information to other parties for
legal reasons (for example, in response to a court order or request
from a law enforcement agency, or to resolve an apparent violation
of our Terms of Service).
</p><p>

If you sign up for a Web hosting account and we issue a
<a href="http://support.tigertech.net/referral">Referral Reward</a>
to an existing customer who referred you, the other customer will know
your domain name and may be able to use the resulting accounting records
to determine the basic cost of the plan you signed up for and the date
you close your account. We do not provide any other information to the
existing customer.
</p><p>

We will not share your contact information with third parties for other
reasons. In particular, we never sell or trade customer information
for marketing purposes.
</p><p>

After you sign up, we will not send you e-mail or postal mail unrelated
to the service you purchased. Instead, the information you supply is
used by us for only these purposes:

</p><ol>
<li>After you order, we send one or more e-mail messages confirming
the order, with instructions on how to get started.
</li><li>As long as you remain a customer, we may occasionally send update
notices that are primarily related to the service you purchased. For
example, from time to time we send notices of new features available
to our Web hosting customers. These messages sometimes include other
promotional announcements about our company, but such announcements
will not be the focus of the message.
</li><li>If you purchase a service that expires after a certain time period
(such as a one-year "domain name only" service), we will send you
renewal notices by e-mail.
</li></ol>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Cookies</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

A few pages on our Web site use "cookies". A cookie is a unique number
or other identifier generated by our servers that allows them to remember
your progress from page to page as you move through our Web site. This
allows us to offer features such as the ability to remember the password
used to login to your account management pages.
</p><p>

The type of cookies we use cannot be used to reference any personal
information unless you supply it yourself by typing it, and cannot
track you once you leave our Web site.
</p><p>

&nbsp;<br>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Encryption</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

In order to further protect customer information, certain forms on our
Web site are run on a secure server, utilizing encryption technology
to safeguard all credit card transactions from unauthorized viewing.
We use industry-standard SSL encryption.
</p><p>


&nbsp;<br>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Summary</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

These measures, together with our belief that it is up to the individual
to determine who receives and what may be done with their personal
information, ensure that we will do our best to protect your privacy.
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at
