<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

We're aware of the growing concern of Internet users regarding the
widespread distribution of their personal information. This privacy policy
describes how we collect and use such information.
<p>


<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Personal Information</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

We request personal information (such as your name, address, and e-mail
address) if you sign up for one of our domain name or Web hosting
services. We do not request, collect or store personal information if
you merely browse our Web site or search for available domain names.
</p><p>

If you choose to sign up for a domain name, we (like all other domain
name registration companies) are required to supply contact
information to the domain registrar. That information is then
governed by the registrar's
<a href="/domainagreement.shtml#DRA">domain registration agreement</a>,
which may allow them to make the information available by the
public WHOIS service. If this is a concern, we recommend using a
PO Box or work address when you sign up for a domain name with us.
</p><p>

We may provide your contact information to other parties for
legal reasons (for example, in response to a court order or request
from a law enforcement agency, or to resolve an apparent violation
of our Terms of Service).
</p><p>

We will not share your contact information with third parties for other
reasons. In particular, we do not sell or trade customer information
for marketing purposes.
</p><p>

After you sign up, we will not send you e-mail or postal mail unrelated
to the service you purchased. Instead, the information you supply is
used by us for only these purposes:

</p><ol>
<li>After you order, we send one or more e-mail messages confirming the order,
with instructions on how to get started.
</li><li>As long as you are a customer, we may occasionally send update notices
that are primarily related to the service you purchased. For example, from
time to time we send notices of new features available to our Web hosting customers.
These messages sometimes include other promotional announcements about our company, although
such announcements will not be the focus of the message.
</li><li>If you purchase a service that expires after a certain time period
(such as a one-year "domain name only" service), we
may send you renewal notices by either e-mail or postal mail.
</li></ol>

<p>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Cookies</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

A few pages on our Web site use "cookies".
A cookie is a unique number generated by our server that allows us to remember your
progress from page to page as you move through our Web site. This allows us to offer
features such as the ability to remember the password used to login to your
account management pages.
</p><p>

Cookies cannot be used to reference any personal information unless you
supply it yourself by typing it, and the type of cookies we use cannot
track you once you leave our Web site.
</p><p>

&nbsp;<br>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Encryption</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

In order to further protect customer information, certain forms on our web site are run on a secure server,
utilizing encryption technology to safeguard all credit card transactions from unauthorized viewing.
We use industry-standard SSL encryption.
</p><p>


&nbsp;<br>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Summary</b></font><br>
<img src="buttons/blank.gif" width="3" height="3" border="0"><br>

These measures, along with our belief that it is up to the individual to determine who
receives and what may be done with their personal information, ensure that we will
do our best to protect your privacy. If you have any questions or concerns, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tigertech.net">support@tigertech.net</a>.
