			<h3 class="title">TIKILIVE™ PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><br>
<strong>1.1 Purpose of Policy </strong><br>
<br>
Eyepartner ("us" or "we") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its members, visitors, and other users (collectively, "members," "you" or "users") of its Eyepartner, websites [hereinafter collectively referred to as "Eyepartner"] This Eyepartner Privacy Policy is provided to help you make an informed decision whether to continue to visit and use Eyepartner, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This policy is only applicable to Eyepartner, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from Eyepartner, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Eyepartner Terms of Service. Both the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service govern your interaction with Eyepartner, and your registration for and use of Eyepartner. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.2 About the Service</strong> <br>
<br>
The Eyepartner website [www.Eyepartner.com] is a web-based interactive multimedia communications service that allows members to interact and communicate with the Eyepartner community over the Internet by sharing their own media content and personal information. The TikiLIVE website [www.TikiLIVE.com] is a venue provided by EYEPARTNER where Eyepartner Members who have registered for the TikiLIVE service can sell access to their content. Some of the Eyepartner services require registration. To utilize Eyepartner’s registration based services, each Eyepartner user must become a registered Member by creating his or her own profile, which contains Personal Information (defined further in Section 2.1(b) below) that the member chooses to include. Such Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, the member’s name, age, location, and other similar personal information; it may also include shared content uploaded by the member to Eyepartner, such as photographs, video and audio files, which may contain the member’s Personal Information and likeness. <br>
<br>
<strong>1.3 Notice Concerning Children </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Eyepartner and any products or services provided therein are limited to audiences fourteen (14) years old or older. Eyepartner does not direct any content specifically at children. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is underage, we will promptly delete any Personal Information in that user’s account. <br>
<br>
<strong>2. Information Collection Practices </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>2.1 Types of Information Collected </strong><br>
<br>
EYEPARTNER collects the following types of information about users:<br>
<br>
(a) Non-Personal Information. When you use Eyepartner, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our websites: 1. IP Addresses; 2. domain servers; 3. types of computers accessing the website; and 4. types of web browsers used to access the website (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on Eyepartner. We also use "cookies" (defined in Section 2.3 below) in order to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the site, and to restrict the access of users who have violated our Terms of Service.<br>
<br>
(b) Personal Information. In order for you to access certain services that we offer via Eyepartner (including Membership registration, and the use of chat rooms and message boards), we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: 1. Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address); 2. Demographic Data (such as your gender, age, occupation, location, and marital status); and 3. And Profile Data (such as your Member name, interests, and Content uploaded by you to Eyepartner, such as photographs, video and audio files, which may also contain your personal information and likeness). Additionally, if you communicate with us by e-mail, use any of the Eyepartner communication tools such as instant messaging, and video chat, or post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information. If you are a TikiLIVE Host (seller), we will collect your credit card information. We do not collect credit card information of TikiLIVE buyers. <br>
<br>
<strong>2.2 Use and Sharing of Information </strong><br>
<br>
(a) EYEPARTNER Use of Personal Information. EYEPARTNER uses your Personal Information internally in order to promote and operate Eyepartner, and to introduce users to new features, areas or content of Eyepartner. For example, we use your Demographic and Profile Data to customize and tailor your experience on Eyepartner and/or services, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. In addition, we use Contact Data to send you information about our Company or our products or services, or family-friendly promotional material from some of our partners, affiliates, or to contact you when necessary. <br>
<br>
(b) Sharing of Non-Personal Information with Third Parties. We may share aggregate Traffic Data with third parties who assist us in understanding the needs of our Members and users, and to continually improve Eyepartner for them. We share Demographic Data with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. <br>
<br>
(c) Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties. We share Contact Data with TikiLIVE Hosts (sellers) with whom you have transacted business with. We also share Contact Data with our contractors who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, data storage and security) related to our operation of the Eyepartner. Those affiliate companies and contractors have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information as necessary to carry out their specific contractual obligations to EYEPARTNER. If you are a TikiLIVE Host (seller), we will disclose your credit card information to those companies that EYEPARTNER uses to authorize and process credit card payments. Your credit card information will never be intentionally disclosed to any other Member or third party. <br>
<br>

Any videos or other content that you submit to Eyepartner (including any Personal Information contained therein) may be distributed through the internet and other media. <br>
<br>
(e) E-mail Invitations. Members can invite friends to join Eyepartner by sending invitations via our automated invitation system. Eyepartner stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend’s list of the member sending the invitations. Recipients of invitations from Eyepartner may contact EYEPARTNER to request the removal of their information from our database. <br>
<br>
