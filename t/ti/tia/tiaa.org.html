Safeguarding your personal information is something that we take very seriously 
at TIAA-CREF. We want to assure you that we will not sell or barter your personal 
information or our mailing lists to any person or organization. You have entrusted 
us with an important role in your financial future and we are committed to keeping 
your personal information secure and to the principles stated in this notice whether 
you are a current, prospective or former customer.</p>
<p>Please read this notice carefully. It will provide you with information about 
the TIAA-CREF companies' policy and procedures with respect to your personal information 
in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Financial Services Modernization Act (GLB). The "TIAA-CREF companies" are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA) and TIAA-CREF 
Life Insurance Company, insurance companies which provide products such as life 
insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuities;</li>
<li>College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), an investment company which is the 
companion organization to TIAA and provides retirement annuities;</li>
<li>TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds and TIAA-CREF Institutional Mutual Funds, investment 
companies;</li>
<li>Teachers Advisors, Inc., an investment advisor which provides services for 
our mutual funds and personal annuities;</li>
<li>Teachers Personal Investors Services, Inc.(TPIS), the broker-dealer for our

<li>TIAA-CREF Individual &amp; Institutional Services, Inc., the broker-dealer for

<li>TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing, Inc.<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup>, an investment

state tuition programs; and</li>
<li>TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB<sup><font size="1">2</font></sup>, a Federally 
chartered savings bank, which provides asset management and fiduciary services.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="1"><sup>1</sup><i>While TIAA, TIAA-CREF Tuition Financing, Inc. and TPIS may 
receive customer information from other TIAA-CREF companies to market the state 
tuition savings programs, customer information collected by these companies in 
managing such programs is not disclosed by them, other than in accordance with 
the applicable program agreements.</i></font></p>
<font size="1"><i><sup>2</sup> Unless, you opt out, the other TIAA-CREF companies may disclose 
customer information to TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB. The policy of TIAA-CREF 
Trust Company, FSB regarding nonpublic personal financial information is stated 
in a separate notice issued by the Trust Company to its customers.</i></font>
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">Information 
We May Collect</font></b></p>
<p>We may collect nonpublic personal financial information about you from various 
sources. For example, a TIAA-CREF company may collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>information you provide on applications and forms or during consultations, 
or that may be necessary to complete your requested transaction;</li>
<li>information pertaining to your relationship with other TIAA-CREF companies, 
such as your ownership of their products;</li>
<li>information from consumer reporting agencies, such as marital status, income, 
size of household, credit score or credit history, open lines of credit, and employment 
history; and 
</li><li>health information for those applying for or owning a long-term care or life 
insurance policy or making a claim under a group long-term disability plan. At 
no time do we disclose your health information to any other TIAA-CREF company or 
other person unless authorized 
by you or required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font color="606060" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How Your 
Information Is Used</font></b></p>
<p>Your personal information is used primarily to provide you with products and 
services you request. It also may be used to determine your possible interest 
in products and services the TIAA-CREF companies offer. If you are a participant 
in an employer-sponsored pension plan which is funded with a TIAA-CREF annuity 
contract, your plan account information also is available to your employer for 
plan administrative purposes.</p>
<p>We limit access to your personal information to those TIAA-CREF employees who 
need to know that information to provide products or services to you or for conducting 
the business of the TIAA-CREF companies. Further, your personal information is 
protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in accordance with 
Federal and state standards, including strict personnel policies, procedures for 
access and use of electronic data, and automated telephone system authentication 
procedures.</p>
<p><b><font color="606060" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Disclosure 
of Your Information</font></b></p>
<p>We do not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA-CREF 
companies unless we have received proper authorization from you or we are permitted 
or required by law to do so. For example, we use independent service providers 
to mail out account statements and materials that you request. In order to protect 
your privacy, our service providers are subject to strict confidentiality, limited 
use, and nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p>Providing the TIAA-CREF companies with access to your information can offer 
you distinct advantages and better service because it would enable us to provide 
you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we have established different 
TIAA-CREF companies to offer you various types of financial products and services. 
Using your information helps us tailor product offerings, eliminating those that 
may not interest you, and helps us keep expenses low by minimizing duplication. 
However, if you do not want other TIAA-CREF companies to use your personal financial 
information this way, you may simply let us know by opting out.</p>
<p>Therefore, <b>unless you tell us otherwise</b>, any of the TIAA-CREF companies 
may access your nonpublic personal financial information from records the other 
TIAA-CREF companies maintain, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>information we obtain from your application, or otherwise obtain to complete 
your requested transaction, such as your age, marital status, beneficiaries, assets, 
income, Social Security number, and employer; and</li>
<li>information we obtain from a consumer report, such as credit data, age, income, 
and marital status.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you opt out, the information about you described above will not be used by 
any other TIAA-CREF company to notify you about new products, services, or enhancements. 
We may, however, disclose your personal financial information to other TIAA-CREF 
companies as permitted by law. At no time do we disclose your health information 
to any other TIAA-CREF company or other person unless authorized by you or required 
by law.</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="606060" size="2">Your Right 
to Opt Out</font></b></p>
<p>If you opt out, your information will not be available to other TIAA-CREF companies. 
To opt out, please call the Telephone Counseling Center at 800 842-2776 or print 
out and complete the <a href="images/privacy_policy.pdf">Privacy Policy form</a> and 
mail it to:</p>
<blockquote>TIAA-CREF-Participant Privacy<br>
P.O. Box 4603
<br>
New York, NY 10163-4603</blockquote>
<p>If you own a life insurance contract or a TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds account with 
a co-owner, you and the co-owner may opt out separately or either of you may opt 
out for both of you. We will only limit disclosure of your information and not 
the co-owner's information, unless you indicate that you also are opting out for 
the co-owner or the co-owner sends us a separate form.</p>
<p>You may receive more than one privacy notice from TIAA-CREF depending on the 
TIAA-CREF products you own. To opt out, you need to respond only once. Your request 
will be treated as an opt-out in accordance with this notice for each of the TIAA-CREF 
companies. Your opt-out will become effective as soon as practicable and will 
remain in effect unless you notify us to change it.</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">TIAA-CREF's 
Commitment to Privacy on our Web Sites</font></b></p>
<p>Regardless of which TIAA-CREF products you may own, we also are committed to 
keeping your personal information secure on our Internet websites. When you visit 
our Web Center, you can go to pages that are open to the general public or log 
onto secure pages where access is permitted only after you have supplied your 
use name and self-selected password. In making certain services available to customers 
on the Internet, we operate an Internet firewall designed to protect these services. 
Only explicitly authorized procedures are made available, limiting the exposure 
to attempts to penetrate the network perimeter and gain access to corporate network 
facilities. The services permitted, electronic mail and access to TIAA-CREF Web 
facilities, are secured in accordance with current industry best practices. Interaction 
with non-public Web sites where customer data is accessed and transactions are 
performed is encrypted. Access to data is controlled by the application itself 
through authentication procedures. These procedures serve to verify your identity, 
so that only you can access your account and initiate transactions through our 
Web Center.</p>
<p>To facilitate information retrieval and expedite your transactions, we place 
a small text file -- referred to as a "cookie" -- on your computer system when 
you access one of our secure functions. Our TIAA-CREF cookie is erased from your 
system whenever your connection to the secure function is terminated because you 
log off or the function is idle for twenty consecutive minutes. Our cookie does 
not collect or retain information. Only our highly secure corporate systems retain 
records of your transactions.</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">Changes 
in our Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
<p>TIAA-CREF periodically reviews its policies and reserves the right to amend 
them. If we amend our privacy policy, we will continue our commitment to keeping 
your personal information secure and will notify you of any changes before they 
become effective.</p>
