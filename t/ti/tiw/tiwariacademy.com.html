<div class="blueText"><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></div>
<div class="innerText">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div>
<p><span id="canSpam"></span></p>
<div class="blueText"><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></div>
