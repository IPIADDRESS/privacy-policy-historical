and services, to name a few, (Indiatimes Channels) hereinafter collectively
referred to as TIL.	
<br> <br>
 	TIL respects the privacy of it's users and is
committed to protect it in all respects.With a view to offer most enriching and
holistic internet experience to it's users TIL offers a vast repository of
Online Sites and variety of community services. You may read 'About Us' to know
more about TIL at http://info.indiatimes.com/terms/aboutus.html. Most of the
Online Community Services are offered for free but you need a Universal
mandatory registration to surf 'Indiatimes Channels' in detail. The information
about the user as collected by TIL is: (a) information supplied by users and (b)
information automatically tracked while navigation
(Information).	
<br> <br>
 	To avail certain sites / services on our websites,
users are required to provide certain information for the registration process
namely:- a) your name, b) email address, c) sex, d) age, e) PIN code etc., and /
or your occupation, interests, and the like. (All required information is
Service Dependent). The Information as supplied by the users enables us to
improve our sites and provide you the most user-friendly experience. In some
sites as in Indiatimes Contests, dating etc. we require your contact
addresses.	
<br> <br>
 	To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our
users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information
to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User
ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer.
Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we
will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your
computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you
supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A
cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign
their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we
do not control.	
<br> <br>
 	Our web servers automatically collect limited
information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP
address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets
computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the
web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use
this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our
site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let
advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors
come.	
<br> <br>
 	TIL includes links to other websites. Such sites are
governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond our control.
Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in
the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is
governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting.
That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of
these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site
directly for more information.	
<br> <br>
 	When we present information to our
advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of
advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics
on traffic to various pages within our site. When you register with TIL, we
contact you from time to time about updation of your content to provide the
users such features that we believe may benefit you.	
<br> <br>
 	All
information gathered on TIL is securely stored within the TIL controlled
database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to
the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective
as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot
guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information
you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the
discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet
access.	
<br> <br>
 	However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may
change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future
changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be
consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless
of what the new policy may be.	
<br> <br>
 	We use third-party advertising
companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use
information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone
number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like
more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having
this information used by these companies, click here:
