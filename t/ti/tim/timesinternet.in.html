Such sites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond our control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.</span><br><span style="color: #47484c;">Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally.

These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and regulations. </span><br><span style="color: #47484c;">b) TIL proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information on its behalf.

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.</span><br><br><span style="color: #47484c; font-weight: bold;">INFORMATION SECURITY</span><br><br><span style="color: #47484c;">We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.

The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable.

And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.</span><br><span style="color: #47484c;">However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes.
