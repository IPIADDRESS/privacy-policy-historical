Our registered office and postal address is Universal House, 251-255 Tottenham Court Road, London W1T 7AB, England.</p>

<p>Time Out is subject to all applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of personal data and privacy in the United Kingdom  including (without limitation) the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC,  the EU Directive on privacy and Electronic Communications 2002/58/EC, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive personal data) Order 2000 and all other industry guidelines (whether statutory or non-statutory) or Codes of Practice issued by the Information Commissioner relating to the processing of personal data or privacy or any amendments and re-enactments thereof.</p>

<p>Time Out has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate a firm commitment to privacy and to disclose the information gathering and sharing practices for www.timeout.com and Time Out Group limited. </p>

<h4>Notice of Collection of Data</h4>

<p>By visiting timeout.com, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy and consent to the collection and use of your personal data by us for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and for any other purpose reasonably necessary for the provision or proper administration of timeout.com and the business of Time Out Group Limited.</p>

<p>If you do not accept the practices set out in this Privacy Policy you should not use timeout.com.</p>

<p>Time Out will consider its Privacy Policy from time to time which may develop and evolve over time, and this policy may change to reflect that. We will use personal data in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which that personal data was collected. You should periodically revisit the timeout.com privacy policy to be sure you are familiar with the current policy. Use of timeout.com following any modifications to the privacy policy will be conclusively deemed as acceptance of the terms of this privacy policy and any changes to the policy both in connection with personal data previously collected and that collected following any changes to this Privacy Policy. Nothing in this privacy policy is meant to impede Time Out's right or ability to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets. </p>

<p>Please note that timeout.com may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy even though they may feature the Time Out logo because of a marketing agreement with Time Out. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of those sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours. You should look for the specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page.  Time Out cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies of other companies. Time Out recommends you review the privacy policy of any site visited on the Internet. </p>

<p><strong>Please also note that where Time Out </strong>make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups that personal data that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information on them.</p><p>

</p><h4>What data is being collected?</h4>

<p>If you are merely visiting the public areas of timeout.com, we do not collect any personal data about you, however, we may automatically collect information about your visits, such as browsing patterns. Information collected in this way does not reveal your contact details or any type of personal data. This information is only used in aggregate form to analyse, manage and develop timeout.com and is not linked to any individual.</p>

<p>We collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. If you choose to fill out any reader surveys, enter a competition, apply for an offer or make a purchase from our online shop, you will be asked to supply some information about yourself, including your name, address, phone number and email address.</p>

<p>Time Out also collects the details provided by you on registration together with information we learn about you from your use of our service and your visits to timeout.com and other sites accessible from it. We also collect information about the transactions you undertake including details of payment cards used.</p> 

<p>When joining 'My Time Out' you will be asked to login using your Facebook account. The My Time Out application asks Facebook for permission to access selected Facebook data, which enables the service to work – for example your Friends list. This data is stored by Time Out against your 'My Time Out' profile. You can choose what personal information is displayed on timeout.com in the Account Settings page. When you login to 'My Time Out' using Facebook the application will check for any changes and update your My Time Out profile accordingly and stored by Time Out. Additionally if you amend details in the 'About You' section of 'My Time Out' this data will be retained as the master copy of your data. If you choose to deactivate your My Time Out account all your data is deleted. Your Facebook account will be unaffected.</p>

<p>If you enter a competition you should read the terms and conditions of that promotion which will confirm how we will use any personal data submitted as part of the entry to the competition.  By entering a competition or applying for an offer you give permission for Time Out to pass your details to any third party sponsor of the competition / offer so they may contact you in the event that you win the competition or qualify for the offer. If you do not win the competition / qualify for the offer your details will not be passed on without your explicit permission.</p> 

<p>We may also collect additional information in connection with information you provide when giving us feedback or completing profile forms. </p>

<h4>What we do with the information collected</h4>

<p>The information you provide is used to fulfill your specific request unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example to add you to one of our mailing lists.</p>

<p>We will use your contact details to communicate with you. </p>

<p>We use personal data for the purpose of providing you with the services you have requested and to personalise our service to you.

All newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of further mailings. You can also opt out of further emails other than service emails which are an integral part of our service, such as purchase confirmations, invoice emails, and customer notices such as those relating to data management and similar purposes.</p>

<p>We use appropriate physical, electronic and managerial security measures to try to prevent that personal data from being accessed by unauthorised persons and to ensure that you may input personal data safely.

</p><p>Only aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns will be given to advertisers. </p>

<p>Individual user details will not be passed on without prior consent. If timeout.com ever requests that you volunteer additional information, such as financial data or age (in an online survey, for example) your response will always be voluntary and this data will only be used as an aggregate of data in conjunction with users of timeout.com as a whole. </p>

<p>Despite these efforts, timeout.com cannot guarantee that a hacker will not obtain access to communications between users and timeout.com.</p>
