<p>This privacy policy describes how Hearst Communications Inc., publisher
of the <i>Times Union</i>, treats the personally identifiable information that is
collected about you when you visit <a href="http://timesunion.com"><b>timesunion.com</b></a> and <a href="http://albany2go.com"><b>albany2go.com</b></a>, the Web
sites of the <i>Times Union</i>. If you have any questions or concerns about these privacy
guidelines, please send e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com"><b>webmaster</b></a>.
</p>

<p>This privacy policy does not apply to information
collected about you by anyone except Hearst Communications ("Hearst") and only applies to the Web sites to which this policy is linked. Any information you provide when you
visit Web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other Web
sites affiliated with Hearst) or when you purchase any products or services
that may be offered or advertised on our Web site by companies other than
Hearst, is subject to the privacy policies of the organizations who run and/or
own these Web sites. This policy also
does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.</p>

<p><b>What
information does the <i>Times Union</i> collect?</b></p>

<p>For individuals 13
and older, the <i>Times Union</i> collects "personally identifying
information" only when you specifically and knowingly provide it. We
gather and save this information in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
 <li>During registration for a contest, poll or forum</li>
 <li>Via e-mail and feedback forms </li>
 <li>When you subscribe to the Times Union online</li>
 <li>When you view stories in our online library</li>
</ul>

<p>(The <i>Times Union</i>
also gathers names and e-mail addresses when you send electronic postcards and
forward articles to friends using the link that appears at the bottom of most
stories. However, we do not store this information; it is used only to send the
postcard or story.) </p>

<p>At the bottom of
pages that collect your personally identifiable information, we ask if you
would like to receive updates about the <i>Times Union</i>, timesunion.com,
albany2go.com or features or targeted
promotions from our advertisers. This opt-in system defaults to "no"
unless you check otherwise. </p>

<p>The <i>Times Union</i>
also collects non-personally identifiable information including the server that
your computer is logged onto, your operating system and your browser type (for
example, Netscape or Internet Explorer). This information is gathered in server
log files for traffic analysis, via online forms for help and troubleshooting
and by our ad server software (RealMedia's OpenAdStream) when an advertisement
is presented. The information collected by the ad server is not personally
identifiable and is used only to measure traffic and advertising effectiveness.
</p>

<p><b>What about
cookies?</b> </p>

<p>If you turn on the
cookie notification setting of your browser, you will see that we sometimes
place a "cookie" on your computer. The cookie itself does not contain
any personally identifying information about you. Rather, we use cookies for
several purposes: </p>

<ul>
 <li>To analyze traffic <!-- on the Times Union  -->and
     measure click throughs to our advertisers' sites. </li>
 <li>To track voting in our polls. </li>
 <li>To record your user name and password
     information while you are visiting our library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as
well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.</p>

<p>

If you don't want cookies, most Web browsers
include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your
browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may not function
efficiently.</p>

<p><b>How does the
<i>Times Union</i> use the information it collects?</b></p>

<p>The <i>Times Union</i> uses this information to provide you with the service
you have requested. If you subscribe to
the <i>Times Union</i>, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation
notice and your mailing address to deliver the paper. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this
information to notify you if you are a winner. </p>

<p>If you opt-in by
checking the box at the bottom of registration forms, your personally
identifying information may be used for additional purposes, such as e-mailing
you with information about new features and offers from the <i>Times Union</i>, albany2go.com or
timesunion.com. In addition, if you opt-in, we may send you advertising
information or other offers we think may be of interest. </p>

<p>Individuals always
have the ability to stop receiving these e-mails by sending an e-mail request
to us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com"><b>webmaster</b></a>. You
may also make reasonable requests to review the personal data collected from
you and to correct any errors. </p>

<p><b>Does the <i>Times
Union</i> share the information with anyone else?</b></p>

<p>The <i>Times Union</i> may disclose information with third parties
if you have given your consent to that disclosure by opting in by checking the
applicable space. The <i>Times Union</i> may disclose information if it is required by
law through a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process or if we need to
protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you
owe us for a subscription). In this instance, the disclosure may take place
without your consent. In addition, we may disclose information to third party
service providers we use to provide products, services or functions on our
behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling
subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the
confidentiality of your information and not to use your it for any reason
except to carry out the purpose for which we hired them.  Finally,
we may share your information with entities under control of, or under common
control with Hearst (for these purposes, a company controlling twenty (20%)
percent or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to
control such entity).	</p>

<p>Beyond that, the
information is not shared with any third parties. </p>

<p><b>How can I be
sure that the privacy policy is maintained?</b></p>

<p>To ensure internal
compliance with this privacy policy, the online editor of the <i>Times Union</i>
reviews and authorizes any use of information. </p>

<p><b>What about
information I share in your forums?</b></p>

<p>You should be
aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., your name,
e-mail address) in the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be
collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other
posters or third parties. </p>

<p><b>When was this
privacy policy most recently updated?</b></p>

<p>We updated this
privacy policy on August 15,2002. We reserve the right to change this policy at
any time. Your continued use of our sites indicates your
consent to this privacy policy and any amended versions of it.</p>

<p><b>Are you a non-U.S. User?</b></p>

If you are located outside of the United States,
please note that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the
United States. By using this Web site, you consent to this transfer.<p></p>

<p><b>Still have
questions or concerns?</b></p>

<p>Send e-mail to us
at <a href="mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com"><b>webmaster</b></a> with any
further questions. </p>

<p><b>Children Under
13 Years Old:</b>
</p>

<p>The <i>Times Union</i>
does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from
children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not send any
information about yourself to us -- including information like your name,
address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age
13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public forums. In the event that we learn
that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without
verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as
possible. </p>

<p>If you believe
that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
contact us at: <a href="mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com"><b>webmaster@timesunion.com</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>Children, 13-18

<p>We recommend that
minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. </p>
