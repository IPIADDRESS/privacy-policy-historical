<b>Timbuk2.com Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p>Last updated: August 18, 2003</p>

<p>Timbuk2.com knows that you care how information about you is used and
shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and
sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting
Timbuk2.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy
Policy. </p>

<p><b>What Personal Information About Customers Does Timbuk2.com Gather?</b></p>

<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
continually improve your shopping experience at Timbuk2.com. Here are
the types of information we gather. </p>

<p>Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter
on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to
provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take
advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you
provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing
future shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with
you. </p>

<p>Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information
whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use
"cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web
browser accesses Timbuk2.com.  A number of companies offer utilities
designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not
be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Timbuk2.com if
we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.</p>

<p>E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and
interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from
Timbuk2.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare
our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort
to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. 
Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you
from other sources and add it to our account information.  </p>

<p>What About Cookies? 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's
hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize
your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your
Shopping Cart between visits. </p>

<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of
Timbuk2.com's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them
turned on. </p>

<p><b>Does Timbuk2.com Share the Information It Receives?</b></p>

<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business,
and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share
customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries
Timbuk2 Designs Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy
Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in
this Privacy Policy. 

</p><p>Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
providing search results and links (including paid listings and links),
processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They
have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,
but may not use it for other purposes. </p>

<p>Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of
Timbuk2.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we
do not give that business your name and address. </p>

<p>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might
sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such
transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents
otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Timbuk2 Designs, Inc., or
substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will
of course be one of the transferred assets. </p>

<p>Protection of Timbuk2.com and Others: We release account and other
personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or
protect the rights, property, or safety of Timbuk2.com, our users, or
others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously,
however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise
disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for
commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this
Privacy Policy. </p>

<p>With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice
when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have
an opportunity to choose not to share the information. </p>

<p><b>How Secure Is Information About Me?</b></p>

<p>
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission
by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information
you input. </p>
<p>
We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when
confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card
number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
account and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a
shared computer.  </p>


<p><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b> </p>

<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information,
even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage
of Timbuk2.com features.  </p>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
altogether. However, you will not be able to use such important features
if you do not use cookies. </p>
<p>In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information
about online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet.

<p><b>Children</b>

</p><p>Timbuk2.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell
children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may
use Timbuk2.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. </p>


<p><b>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</b></p>

<p>If you choose to visit Timbuk2.com, your visit and any dispute over
privacy is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Use, including
limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the
law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at
Timbuk2.com, please send us a thorough description to
<a href="mailto:customerservice@timbuk2.com">customerservice@Timbuk2.com</a>, and we will try to resolve it. </p>

<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the
Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of
our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but
you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless
stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information
that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we
make, however, and will never materially change our policies and
practices to make them less protective of customer information collected
in the past without the consent of affected customers. </p>
