<h2 class="st-Static_Main_ListHeader">What information do we gather/track about you?</h2>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">We may collect or obtain such data because you give it to us (for example in a form on our Website), or
because it is publicly available.</p>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">Other examples of what information we may collect about you include the following:</p>
<h3>Registration:</h3>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">During the free registration process to become a registered member of our Website you are required to
supply us with certain information about you such as your e-mail address and demographic information. </p>
<h3>IP Addresses:</h3>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">We also log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration
and troubleshooting purposes. We do not use IP address logs to track your session or your behaviour on our
site.</p>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) says that we are permitted to use personal information only
if we have a proper reason to do so. This includes sharing it outside Allied Newspapers Limited. The
regulation says we must have one or more of these reasons:</p>
<ul class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">
<li>to fulfil a contract we have with you, or;</li>
<li>when it is our legal duty to do so, or;</li>
<li>when it is in our legitimate interest, or;</li>
<li>when you consent to it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. But even
then, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. If we rely on our legitimate interest,
we will tell you what that is.</p>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">Here is a list of how we may use your personal information, and which of the reasons we rely on to do so.
Here we also tell you what our legitimate interests are.</p>

<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">We use a range of physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your personal

<li>physical security measures, such as staff security passes to access our premises.</li>
</ul>
<p class="st-Static_Main_ListBody">Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal data, the
