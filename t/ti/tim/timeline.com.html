(“Timeline.com,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides its services (described below) to you through its website located at www.timeline.com (the “Site”) and through its mobile applications, plug-ins, widgets and related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications, and the Site, the “Service(s)”), subject to this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;The Service is designed to provide users with historical context for news stories or other content on the Internet. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy sets forth Timeline.com’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p><h3>Information We Collect:</h3><p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p><h3>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</h3><p>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Timeline.com collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p><p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Timeline.com and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p><h3>Other Information:</h3><p>Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Timeline.com through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Timeline.com may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Timeline.com affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p><p>In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</p><h3>Aggregated Personal Data:</h3><p>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Timeline.com often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Timeline.com may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Timeline.com may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p><h3>Location Information:</h3><p>Our Service may collect and use your location information (for example, by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location features, your location information may be publicly displayed within the Service.

Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, so please be careful if you choose to enable location functionality. We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described above in the “Aggregated Personal Data” section.</p><h3>Google Analytics:</h3><p> We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</p><h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h3><p>Timeline.com uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

Timeline.com and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications.
