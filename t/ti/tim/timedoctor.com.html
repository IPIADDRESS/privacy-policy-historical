        <h2> Privacy Policy </h2>
        <h3> Our Commitment To Data Security </h3>
        <p>Your privacy is imperative. TimeDoctor.com has  developed this Privacy Statement to describe our practices of collecting and  managing your information. We only collect and use your information through  means allowed by law.<br>

We may record mouse movements of you using the  web application in order to improve the usability of our site, using a third  party such as userfly.com.<br><br>
        
        Screenshots recorded can be viewed by you and by  any person who manages you in your company. You can delete screenshots from the  system (and this will correspondingly delete the corresponding amount of time  worked). All other information such as websites visited and applications used  can be viewed by any person in your company who manages you and also by  yourself. Screenshot, website and application data is only tracked when you  record that you are working on your computer and is not recorded when you are  on a break. Website and application monitoring is active for all users of the  system when they are tracking time. Screenshot monitoring can be individually  activated or deactivated by your company admin for team members on your team.
        <br><br>
        
        The Time Doctor desktop app does record the  number of keystrokes or mouse movements you make. It does not however record  where you click on the screen, and it does not record what you type. It is not  a keystroke-logging application.
        <br><br>
        Other information recorded automatically  includes: IP address where you logged in, browser type and browser software  version.<br>
