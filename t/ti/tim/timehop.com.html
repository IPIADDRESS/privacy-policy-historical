When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit Personal Information. This Personal Information is used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a third party, aggregate information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor. Personal Information collected through market research will be used only by Timehop and its service providers and contractors and will not be given or sold to third parties other than such service providers or contractors without your consent or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. We will not knowingly accept survey responses from or conduct interviews with any person under the age of 18. In addition to collecting survey responses from our members, cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to connect survey data with Timehop site usage characteristics. You will be notified when we would like to use cookies in this way and your consent will be requested for these cookies.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>4. Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Behalf of Timehop</strong></h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Certain content and Services offered to you through our Site and Application are served on websites hosted and operated by a company other than Timehop ("Third Party Contractor Websites"). Timehop does not disclose information collected from you to these Third Party Contractor Websites, other than unique device identifiers and information disclosed with your explicit consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose once you access these other websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Timehop does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Contractor Websites. You should review the privacy policy posted on any other website to understand how that Third Party Contractor Website collects and uses your personally identifiable information.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>5. Third Party Websites</strong></h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Site may contain links to third party websites to which Timehop has no affiliation.&nbsp; Timehop does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. Some websites may have the look and feel of our Site. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy only covers our Site. Should you decide to visit third party websites, we suggest that you read their privacy policies.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you register for the Service and grant Timehop access to accounts you may have with third party service providers, Personal Information that you post to your accounts with those third party service providers may be viewable on or through the Site and Services, subject to the privacy settings you have set in your third party accounts.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>6.

We share Personal Information and Traffic Data with other companies and people who assist us by performing core services (such as website hosting, data storage and security, marketing assistance and customer service) related to our operation of the Site and/or by making certain Services available to our users. Those business partners and agents shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to and to provide you with Site related services. Timehop may share aggregated demographic information with business partners, and anonymized information with analytics and advertising partners.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Timehop’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the EU-US Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Timehop remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Timehop proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last, we may transfer information about you to another company in connection with a merger, sale of assets or the business or acquisition by or of Timehop. If Timehop, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Timehop goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Timehop may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Timehop does not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information with any third parties for their promotional purposes.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the rights of any third party and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site or Services, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Services or members of the public. We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>7.
