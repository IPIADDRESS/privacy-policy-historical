We have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we gather and use information about you.  By using either this web site, or Intervals, you consent and agree to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.  We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy.  These changes will be effective when posted on the Myintervals.com web site.  It is your responsibility to review our Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it.  Your continued use of either this Site, or Intervals following the posting of any such change, shall constitute your acceptance thereof.  We will notify you of any changes to this Privacy Policy by making those changes on this Privacy Policy, and revising the date in the Last Update paragraph below.</p>

					<p>
					We require people who register to use Intervals to give us contact and account information, such as your name, company name, address, email address, phone number and fax number, as well as financial and billing information, such as billing name and address and credit card number.</p>

					<p>
					Pelago does not distribute or share customer email addresses, except as noted in Pelago's Terms of Service, as may be required by law, for billing and collection purposes, or with Pelago customers with which such email address is, or appears to be affiliated.
					</p><p>
					Pelago uses the information that we collect to set up Intervals for individuals and their organizations.  We may also use the information to contact customers and prospects to discuss their interest in our company, Intervals or service we provide and ways to improve Intervals, and to send information regarding our company or partners, including information on promotions and events.  We may also email a company newsletter and updates about Intervals or Pelago.
