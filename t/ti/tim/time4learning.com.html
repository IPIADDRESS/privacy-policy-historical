										You have trusted us&nbsp;to make safe and quality content that children can 
										enjoy.&nbsp; In the cyberspace world, this trust is even more important to your 
										family, and to time4leearning.com. To make sure that this site stays safe and 
										fun, we make the following promises:
										</p><p>
											</p><ul>
												<li>
													In almost all activities, the information we collect is non-personal (such as 
													first name, age, city and state). If you enter a contest, send us a question or 
													send an electronic postcard, we will also ask for an e-mail address. We only 
													collect enough information from our visitors to make activities on 
													time4learning.com&nbsp;fun and interesting.
													<p></p>
												</li><li>
													If you submit stories, artwork, comments or anything else to us which is posted 
													on our site, you will be identified on our site only by first name, age, city 
													and state.
													<p></p>
												</li><li>
													If you send us an e-mail with a question or comment, or enter one of our 
													contests, we will write back using your e-mail address, but we will not keep 
													the address or use it again.
													<p></p>
												</li><li>
													If you ask&nbsp;time4learning.com to send an electronic postcard or e-mail 
													message, we will ask for your first name and e-mail address as well as the 
													e-mail address of the person who will receive the postcard. We will only use 
													this information to send the postcard or message and we will delete the 
													information when the postcard or message is sent.
													<p></p>
												</li><li>
													No one will be excluded from our site for not giving us personal information. 
													When we do ask for personal information (like an e-mail address), we will only 
													keep it until that particular activity is complete. We will not share this 
													information with a third party.
													<p></p>
												</li><li>
													Children using the time4learning.com environment which requires a login, have 
													been pre-approved through accounts set up by their parents.&nbsp;
													<p></p>
												</li>
											</ul>
										<p>
										As you surf around time4learning.com, it is possible that several cookies* will 
										be set on your computer. time4learning.com uses the information from cookies to 
										deliver relevant local resources, remember browser preferences, and improve our 
										visitors' experiences on the site. No personal information is ever stored in a 
										time4learning.com&nbsp;cookie.&nbsp;
										</p><p>
										tim4leearning.com&nbsp;does not sell information collected by cookies or use 
										the information for commerce-related purposes. In 
										addition,&nbsp;time4learning.com will not filter content based on your 
										preferences without permission.
										</p><p>*What's a cookie? <i>A cookie is information a Web site puts on your computer's hard 
												drive so that the site can remember your preferences or which pages you visited 
												on that site.</i>
										</p><p>time4learning.com only uses cookies at the following times:
											</p><ul>
												<li>
												To capture the local time from your computer in order to properly set timers 
												and counters.
												</li><li>
												To remember parental login name (for easier access) and to automatically load 
												the children associated with the parental account.
												</li><li>
													<p>As you explore pbskids.org, a session cookie will tell us which pages you visit 
														and the amount of time between each page visit. This cookie does not remember 
														any information about you or your computer, it just tells us at PBS Kids how 
														long visitors spend on our sites and which pages receive the most traffic. A 
														"session cookie" only remembers information about your current visit to the 
														site.
													</p>
													<p></p>
												</li>
											</ul>
										<p>
										We also promise to help families and communities find the information they need 
										to use the Internet safely and responsibly.
										</p><p>
											</p><ul>
												<li>
													When a PBS Kids site is partially funded by outside sponsors, we will mark any 
													underwriter logos with a "sponsored by" tag. We choose our underwriters 
													carefully, to make sure that the company's products and services fit PBS 
													standards. PBS Kids sites will not contain advertisements promoting e-commerce 
													or direct links to e-commerce.
													<p></p>
												</li><li>
													All links to third party sites are insulated with a time4learning.com bridge 
													page. These pages clearly notify the visitor that he or she is leaving 
													time4learning.com, and offers an opportunity to return to time4learning.com. 
													Each bridge page displays a Web literacy tip, educating visitors how to be safe 
													on the Internet. In the case of a sponsor's link, the bridge page will provide 
													more information about the sponsor's relationship to time4learning.com. Since 
													we cannot be assured that links to outside sites follow our safety or privacy 
													guidelines, we encourage families to discuss these choices together. We are not 
													responsible for the content or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked 
													from our pages.
												</li>
											</ul>
										<p>
										Your family's use of this site is conditioned on your having accepted these 
										terms. You should check back to this policy frequently, since it is subject to 
										change from time to time, and your continued use of the site is conditioned 
										upon your acceptance of any modifications hereto.
										</p><p>We want to make this site a place where families can surf together, and where 
											parents and caregivers are happy to have their children interact, learn and 
											play. If you have any comments or questions, we're happy to hear them. This is, 
											after all, <b>your</b>
										site.
										</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, send us an e-mail
