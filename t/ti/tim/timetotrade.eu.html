            <p><b>Statement of policy</b><br>
</p><p><b>timetotrade</b> is a trading name of Sensatus (UK) Ltd.  
</p><p>Sensatus (UK) Ltd (“Sensatus”, “the company” “we”, “us”) is fully committed to compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act”), which came into force on the 1st March 2000.  Sensatus will therefore follow procedures that aim to ensure that all employees, contractors, agents, consultants, partners or other servants of the company who have access to any personal data held by or on behalf of the company, are fully aware of and abide by their duties and responsibilities under the Act.
</p><p>Sensatus regards the lawful and correct treatment of personal information as very important to its successful operations and to maintaining confidence between Sensatus and those with whom it carries out business.  Sensatus will ensure that it treats personal information lawfully and correctly.
</p><p>To this end Sensatus fully endorses and adheres to the Principles of Data Protection as set out in the Data Protection Act 1998.
</p><p>These principles state that personal data must be:-
</p>
<ul><li>Fairly and lawfully processed
</li><li>processed for specified and lawful purposes and not in any other way which would be incompatible with those purposes
</li><li>adequate, relevant and not excessive
</li><li>accurate and kept up to date
</li><li>not kept for longer than is necessary
</li><li>processed in line with the data subject’s rights
</li><li>kept secure
</li><li>not transferred to a country which does not have adequate data protection laws
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p><p><b>What do we do?</b><br>
</p><p>Sensatus (UK) Ltd provides charting and technical analysis alerting tools for securities such as stocks and options traded in regional markets (“Securities”) using, including but not limited to, electronic mail, instant messenger application, text messages, Java applications and such other methods as Sensatus may find appropriate from time to time (the "Notification Services").
</p><p>Sensatus provides accountancy solutions for managing investment transactions and tax returns for securities such as stocks and options (the "Accountancy Services"). 
</p><p>Sensatus also provides portfolio management and performance reporting solutions for securities such as stocks and options (the “Portfolio Management Services”).  
</p><p>The Notification Services, Accountancy Services and Porfolio Management Services will be collectively referred to as the "Services". The Services are hosted on secure servers and delivered directly over the internet via the website www.timetotrade.eu (the "website").
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>What information do we collect?</b><br>
The Act provides conditions for the processing of personal data.  Personal data is data that can be used to identify individuals, and includes name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and email address.  
</p><p>Sensatus is required to maintain certain personal data about living individuals for the purposes of satisfying operational and legal obligations and in order to carry on its business and meet its customers’ requirements effectively.      
</p><p>When you register for the Sensatus Services, we will collect your name, country of residence and email address.  In addition, certain personal data is required for us to supply the products and services that you have requested.  If you request to use the Notification Services we will collect your mobile telephone number.  If you request to use the Accountancy and Portfolio Management Services we will collect your investment transaction history.    
</p><p><br>
<b>How do we use Personal Data</b><br>
Personal data is required for us to supply the Services that you have requested, carry out an agreement with you or take any steps that you have requested. Examples of additional required uses of your personal data include:
</p>
<ul><li>Updating you as to the status of your order 
</li><li>Alerting you to important product revisions or updates to an Sensatus product/service you purchased 
</li><li>Ensuring that you are properly registered to receive technical support 
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p><p>In the event that you submit personal data by telephone, Sensatus may monitor or record your call to: 
</p>
<ul><li>Provide evidence of your order or transaction with us 
</li><li>Ensure that we comply with relevant regulatory procedures 
</li><li>See that quality standards or targets are being met 
</li><li>Protect the interests of national security 
</li><li>Prevent or detect crime 
</li><li>Investigate the unauthorised use of a telecommunications system 
</li><li>Secure the effective operation of our telecommunications system <br>
</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the above uses, we may also use your personal data for the following additional purposes and direct marketing ("Additional Purposes") where you have given us appropriate permission: 
</p>
<ul><li>To tell you about special discounts on Sensatus products and services 
</li><li>To advise you about new Sensatus products and services 
</li><li>To advise you about offers from other companies that Sensatus feels may be of interest to you. (In these instances, Sensatus forwards the offer to you but does not share your personal data with these other companies.) 
</li></ul>
<p><br>
To help us improve our products and services and develop new ones, we may also create aggregate data that uses your personal data but in a manner that will not identify you as an individual. For example, we may look at your address to help identify the total number of users of a particular product in a geographic area. Aggregate data is not personal data, as it cannot be used to identify any particular individual. 
</p><p>Occasionally, we may invite you to participate in a survey or provide additional personal data that will enable us to better understand and serve your needs. Any such information request is optional and gives you the freedom to decide whether to respond. Please keep in mind that all information you provide may be used to personalise and improve our customer service operations.
</p><p>Sensatus may use certain third-party service providers to help us fulfil your requests. For example, we use third party service providers to process credit card payments and host the Sensatus servers.  In all instances, these third-party service providers are under a contractual duty to restrict their use of personal data to the limited purpose(s) specified by Sensatus, which at all times shall be consistent with this Privacy Policy. 
</p><p>Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will not be transferred to a third party for their independent use without your express consent.
</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that there are very limited instances under law in which we may be required to disclose the personal data of our customers. If such an instance arises, we shall only release that personal data as required by law. 
</p><p><br>
</p><p><b>What about “Cookies”?</b><br>
</p><p>A "cookie" is a small bit of data that gets stored on your computer RAM or hard drive when you access particular Web sites.

The setting that controls cookies can be modified on most browsers by clicking on "Tools" on the menu bar of the browser, then clicking "Internet Options," and going to the tab marked "Privacy" where you can specify how you want to manage cookies. Here are some examples of how Sensatus may use cookies:
</p><p>To make a purchase through the Sensatus, you must accept those cookies that supply your browser with a unique identifier, which we use to identify a previous visitor to our website and to better understand aggregate use of our website.
