<h2>6. TITO TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

<p>We store and process your Personal Data on servers located within the European Economic Area (the "<strong>EEA</strong>"). However, we may transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA where we engage with third party services providers. We only transfer your personal data outside the EEA where the European Commission has decided that the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection in line with EEA data protection standards <u>or</u> there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Data. If you would like to find out more about the appropriate safeguards that we have in place to govern the transfer of your Personal Data you can contact our Data Protection Representative Cillian Oâ€™Ruanaidh who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:security@tito.io">security@tito.io</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will always do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strictly maintained physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>We do not store or process any of your card or payment information. All payment information is processed by our trusted third party payment providers.</p>

<h2>7. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

<p>In general, we expect to keep your Personal Data for as long as you use the Tito Services plus a period of up to 7 years thereafter. However we shall delete your IP address after 90 days. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may hold your personal data for a different period, for example, if we believe in good faith that the law or a relevant regulator may reasonably in our view expect or require us to preserve or delete your Personal Data.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about how long we will retain your Personal Data, please contact our Data Protection Representative Cillian Oâ€™Ruanaidh who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:security@tito.io">security@tito.io</a>.</p>

<h2>8. HOW WE STORE AND SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

<p>We care about protecting your information. That's why we put in place appropriate measures that are designed to prevent unauthorised access to, and misuse of, your Personal Data. We also have in place measures to deal with and respond to any suspected data breach.</p>

<p>We are committed to taking reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Data that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access. We do this by having in place a range of appropriate technical and organisational measures.</p>
