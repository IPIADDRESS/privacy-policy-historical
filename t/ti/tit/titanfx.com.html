<p>Here at ICU.net,&nbsp; your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operations of
ICU.net, we do not routinely gather information about our users
for distribution outside of the ICU.net. This Privacy Policy explains that information about our users is held in the
strictest confidence and will not be sold, given away, traded, parlayed or
exchanged with any third party except as stated in this document.</p>
<b>
<p>Information Collected by ICU.net</p>
</b>
<p>ICU.net collects information about users at the time of account
setup for contact and billing purposes. This information is closely guarded and
can only be obtained or changed by that user upon the receipt of positive identification.
We use the concept of a secret word, and other measures that are established at the time of account
activation. The secret word is a combination of letters, numbers and/or
characters unique to only that user / account that the user has designated.</p>
<b>
<p>Personal Information</p>
</b>
<p>Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register for
membership services. These services include receiving electronic mail (an e-mail
address) This information enables ICU.net to improve its sites
to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable through the use of
electronic messaging. Your Email address is never given to others.</p>
<b>
<p>Information Tracking</p>
</b>
<p>One method of collecting information about you is by tracking your Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically
assigned to your computer whenever you connect to the Internet. The computers
that deliver information to you automatically identify your computer by its IP
address.</p>
<b>
<p>Search Terms</p>
</b>
<p>As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into
our sites' search features. Search data and user-provided information help to
improve the relevancy of search results by learning user preferences and
prioritizing search results accordingly. The intended result is a more efficient
search feature for visitors to Internet sites through the use of web content
caching.</p>
<b>
<p>Use of Cookies</p>
</b>
<p>Some ICU.net sites use cookies. Cookies are used for the purpose
of your security only. We at ICU.net believe that the information you send over the Internet should be viewed by only two parties,
yourself and your intended recipient, whether that being a single individual, as
in e-mail or an audience, ie: a newsgroup.</p>
<b>
<p>What is a Cookie? Yum, yum</p>
</b>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that Web sites store in your computer when you
visit their site. Cookies permit the site to identify you, and possibly track
your activity. They also allow you to visit various members-only parts of our
sites without re-registering. Cookies allow web site operators to determine
which areas and features of their sites are most popular by measuring user
activity. This information allows them to make improvements and updates to
improve your Internet experience.</p>
<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you may set your
browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However,
some parts of our sites, such as the members-only areas (i.e. web based e-mail)
will not function properly if you choose not to accept cookies.</p>
<p>You may occasionally get cookies from advertisers. ICU.net does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to
ICU.net's Privacy Policy.</p>
<b>
<p>Use of Information Collected by ICU.net</p>
</b>
<p>ICU.net uses your personal information for billing and
technical support purposes only.</p>
<b>
<p>Sharing Data with Third Parties</p>
</b>
<p>ICU.net does not share information with third parties for
advertising, promotional or any other purpose. ICU.net may share
personal information with law enforcement agencies if such information is
lawfully requested, or if ICU.net believes that our service has
been used in a manner that is prohibited by our Terms and Conditions of Service.</p>
<b>
<p>Internet Shopping</p>
</b>
<p>Some, if not most Internet shopping sites allow you to make online purchases.
These purchases may require credit card and personal contact information.
ICU.net does not store your information and thus will not send it to
any 3<sup>rd</sup> parties. Only the merchant will receive your information when
you make your purchase, using encryption technology to protect your information
during this transfer, as long as the merchant uses Secure Server Software, also
known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
<p>SSL encrypts all of your personal information transmitted over the Internet,
such as your credit card number and name and address. This technology is
designed to protect your information by rendering it useless, should it ever be
intercepted in transit. We will continue to provide the highest level of
security by implementing improved technologies as they become available.</p>
<p>Note that online merchants follow separate privacy policies. When you visit a
web site, you should read their privacy policy if it is available. ICU.net is not responsible for policies other than our own. For more
information about a merchant's policy, visit the merchant's home page and read
carefully its privacy policy.</p>
<b>
<p>Children and Privacy</p>
</b>
<p>Since the Internet is generally considered to be an adult venue, ICU.net encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children
online, and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. ICU.net will not knowingly provide an Internet access account to anyone under
the age of 18 without parental approval.</p>
<p>We do not offer any Internet sites that cater primarily to children.</p>
<b>
<p>Community and Public Areas</p>
</b>
<p>Information posted to message boards, chat areas, clubs and home pages is
available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any such
information. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to
provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message
boards. Users of chat areas and message boards must follow acceptable standards
of behavior when posting messages online. The Internet Connection reserves the
right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole
discretion is considered inappropriate.</p>
<b>
<p>Links to Other Sites</p>
</b>
<p>ICU.net sites contain links to sites other than our own.
Those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as ICU.net.
Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or partners who may use our
logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send
their own cookies to you, and may collect information and use it in a way
inconsistent with ICU.net's privacy policy. ICU.net does not control the content that appears on these sites. Such sites
may contain information that content providers independent of ICU.net have created, maintained, published, posted or otherwise made
available.</p>
<p>The use of any information or materials that you may access at these external
sites is purely voluntary. You should not rely on the contents without
independent and thorough review of the accuracy, completeness, effectiveness,
and correct sequencing. These external sites may also refer to specific
commercial products, processes, or services by trade name, trademark, service
mark, manufacturer or otherwise. Unless ICU.net has provided
explicit authority, such references in no way indicate our endorsement,
recommendation or preference.</p>
<b>
<p>Additional Information</p>
</b>
<p>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely
secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of ICU.net to intercept or access transmissions or private
communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information,
ICU.net cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, shall
ICU.net be liable for any special, incidental or consequential
damages that result from the use of the information or materials on sites other
than ICU.net.</p>
<p>ICU.net reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at
any time. Any such changes will be posted online.</p>
