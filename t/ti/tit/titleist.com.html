<h2>What Information Is Collected</h2>
<p>When you visit this Site, we recognize only your domain name and not your e-mail address. We will see your e-mail address only if you fill out a form or send us an e-mail message. We may also collect information about you if you register on a page, fill out a survey, place an order, upload content, post blog entries or comments, participate in our contests or if you otherwise voluntarily tell us about yourself or your activities. We collect Internet-related Information from visitors to our Site, including the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to come to this Site, the country, state or province, the pages of our Site that you viewed during your visit and any search terms you entered on our Site, for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of Site activity. We track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online sessions, including which pages or specific URLs a customer views while using the Site. We use your Internet-related Information to diagnose problems with our servers and software and to administer our Site.</p>
<h2>How Information Is Used</h2>

When you use interactive features like our blogs (posting entries or submitting comments), or submit user content, please keep in mind that these features are inherently interactive. Information and materials you submit will be publicly available, thus if you include in your submission personally identifiable information (using your full name in the "name" field of a blog comment, for example), that information will become available to the general public on the Site. In addition, if you so choose to set your Team Titleist profile to “public,” other data about you will be publicly available.
