					<h2>Site Privacy Policy</h2>
				</center>
				TiVo Inc. has created this Site Privacy Policy in order to 
				demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. <br>
				<br>
				The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination 
				practices only for this web site: <a href="http://www.tivo.com">www.tivo.com.</a> 
				TiVo has a separate privacy policy that controls our use of 
				information that is gathered as part of the TiVo service. 
				We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our 
				server, and to administer our web site. However, we do not 
				collect any personally identifiable information about you 
				unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Our 
				site uses an order form for you to request information, products, 
				and services. Contact information (like your email address) 
				from the order form is collected and used to send you information 
				about our company. Your contact information is also used to 
				get in touch with you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving 
				future mailings: see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.<br>
				<br>
				We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information 
				from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we 
				ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian 
				before providing us with any personally identifiable information. 
				This site contains links to other sites. www.tivo.com is not 
				responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such 
				web sites.<br>
				<br>
				<b><i>Security</i></b><br>
				We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally 
				identifiable information from unauthorized access. Among other 
				techniques, we usually store such information on a computer 
				behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we often restrict 
				the number of employees internally who can access such data. 
				Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on 
				the Internet. Further, please note that our servers are run 
				by a third party web host whose actions we do not control. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b><i>Disclosure of Information</i></b><br>
				Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your 
				personally identifiable information to any third parties. 
				However, we might share your personally identifiable information 
				with other members of the TiVo family, and we do sell and 
				rent aggregated (non-personally identifiable) information 
				about our users generally. <br>
				<br>
				<b><i>Use of Information</i></b><br>
				We use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable 
				information for internal marketing purposes and for site administration. 
				However, unless we tell you otherwise, we usually do not use 
				personally identifiable information collected from the web 
				site to send unsolicited mailings to you. Of course, if applicable, 
				we do use personally identifiable information to perform the 
				services for which such data was collected (i.e., if you sign 
				up for an email newsletter, we will send the email newsletter 
				to the address you provide us).<br>
				<br>
				<b><i>Choice/Opt-Out</i></b><br>
				Our site provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving 
				communications from us and our partners at the point where
