Personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as name, street address and email address.  On some pages of TidalTV’s web sites, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as when submitting a request for a media kit or requesting that TidalTV contact you.  Additionally, if you enter into a business relationship with TidalTV, we may require that you provide us with personal information for administrative purposes, such as maintaining account information, preparing invoices and issuing payment.

Click-stream data can include information such as IP address, date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited and information on your interaction with the Services, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed.  We may also use shared objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to store click-stream data and, in some instances, we may also use web beacons (also referred to as “pixels” or “gifs”) in connection with cookies and shared objects, in each case, to assist in providing you with more relevant, meaningful advertising experience.  All browser activity reporting is done anonymously.  For more detailed information on cookies, web beacons and shared objects, please see our  <a href="faq.html">FAQs</a></p>
