			<h2>TicketLeap Privacy Policy</h2>

		<!--Added by nikhil 07/23/2209 replace new text-->
<p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome
to the Ticketleap, Inc. ("Ticketleap," "We,"
"Us," or "Our") website.  This Privacy Policy
applies to all users of <u><a href="http://www.ticketleap.com/">www.ticketleap.com</a></u>
(the "Site") or Our services, and to any information
provided to Us.  By using the Site, You are accepting the policies
described herein.  This Privacy Policy has been created to inform
You, the user, how We gather, use, treat, and disseminate Your
personally-identifiable information and data.  This Privacy Policy
only applies to transactions made, and information gathered, on Our
Site only and does not apply to any other website, even websites to
which We provide links.  You must contact that particular website
operator or company to determine what its privacy practices are,
which may be much different than Our practices.  Also, this Privacy
Policy does not apply to any contact that You have with Us or Our
office outside of Your actual usage of Our Site while on the
internet.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Please review this
Privacy Policy periodically as We may update it from time-to-time. 
This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 7, 2009.  Each time You
visit the Site or provide Us with any information, You are hereby
accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that
time.  You expressly consent to Our use and disclosure of Your
information as provided herein.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"></p><h4>What Information We
Collect and How We Do It</h4><p></p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Information can
generally be collected in two ways: (1) information that is knowingly
and voluntarily input into Our system directly by You in response to
particular prompts or fields; and (2) information that is collected
automatically when You use the Site.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some information can be
"personally identifiable." We use the term "personally
identifiable" information to mean any type of information which
could be utilized to identify or be readily associated with You, the
user of this Site. Examples of personally identifiable information
include, but are not limited to, Your name, address, telephone
number, financial data, and e-mail address, or any combination
thereof.  In order to operate Our Site and provide You with
information on events and services that may be of interest to You, We
collect personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address,
phone number, and e-mail address), financial information (e.g.
passwords, credit/debit card numbers, bank, and other account
numbers) and demographic information (e.g. zip code, hometown,
gender, purchase history, and age) from You. Please note that, in
some instances as described below, We treat financial information
differently than We treat other types of personally identifiable
information.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Site is not
designed to appeal to children under the age of thirteen (13) and
nowhere on the Site do We knowingly market Our services or knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under the
age of thirteen (13).</p><br>

<p></p><h4>Voluntary Release of
Information</h4><p></p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever You are
prompted by the Site to complete forms, provide payment information,
and make choices, for example, and You choose to do so, You are
voluntarily providing information to Us.  This information may or may
not be personally identifiable, depending upon what You are asked to
provide and how We use it.  The transmission of an e-mail voluntarily
initiated by You to Us can also transmit personally identifiable
information about You depending upon what information You choose to
include in Your e-mail.  You should not send personally identifiable
information through Our Site via unencrypted e-mail, particularly
information that You deem to be sensitive or confidential.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>Automatic Collection
of Information</h4><p></p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The automatic
collection of information refers to information collected from You
that does not require You to provide information in response to
particular fields or prompts.  This can be done through the use of
software or other automated processes that Our Site uses.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, this Site,
like many websites on the internet, uses "cookies."  A
cookie is a small text file automatically placed on Your computer's
web browser that is used to recognize users who have previously
visited the Site.  In general, these cookies are either persistent
and may reside on Your computer for several months after You last
accessed the Site (or until You delete or otherwise dispose of them),
or on a temporary basis.  Our Site also uses temporary cookies called
"session cookies," which are stored for a single user
session with the Site and are deleted as soon as the user's browser
is shut down.  We use cookies for purposes that include, but are not
limited to, keeping track of Your purchases and other activity on the
Site, delivering content specific to Your interests, saving Your
password, and if You choose, saving other personal and financial
information so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the
Site.  We do this to enhance Your experience on Our Site and to make
it as easy to use as possible.  Third-party advertisers on the Site
may also place cookies on Your browser.  If You wish to disable these
cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers
will likely tell You how to do so.  Please note, however, that if You
choose to set Your browser to disable cookies, You may not be able to
access certain areas of Our Site.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like most websites,
each time You visit the Site, We automatically collect Your "internet
protocol" ("IP") address (and the website address that
directed You to Us, when applicable).  An IP address is a unique
series of numbers that identifies each computer connected to the
internet.  An IP address can be used to provide information such as
the date and time of a user's visit, the availability of certain
requested files, the popularity of various website functions, and the
amount of information transmitted to each user from a site. 
Presently, We use Your IP address to address the frequency of Your
visits to this Site and to determine the frequency with which certain
pages and functions of the Site are accessed.  This will allow Us to
improve the Site's functionality and to diagnose problems.  Your IP
address is used to help identify You and to gather demographic
information.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>How We Use Your
Personally Identifiable Information</h4><p></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We
use Your personally identifiable information for a variety of
purposes, including, but not limited to, helping Us to perform
transactions on the Site efficiently, delivering the services that
You request, managing Your account, providing You with customer
service, enforcing <a href="/info/terms.aspx"><b>Our Terms of
Service</b></a>, protecting
against or identifying fraudulent transactions, contacting You
regarding events for which You purchased tickets on the Site
(including event confirmations, changes and cancellations), sending
information, offers, and other promotional materials to You from Us
and from selected third parties with whom We have a business and/or
commercial relationship.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We
send offers that We believe would be of interest and value to You,
such as discounts, exclusive deals, special events, or other
information.  The Site provides You with the option of declining to
receive these types of offers from Us by "opting-out."  By
opting-out, We give You the choice to not receive these types of
communications, although We will still contact You regarding any
specific events to which You have purchased tickets.  You will be
given the option to opt-out after You receive Your first offer from
Us.  We will provide a link that You can use to opt-out of receiving
subsequent marketing e-mails sent by Us.  Please note, however, that
opting-out of receipt of e-mail communications from Us and/or third
parties, but not Event Affiliates (as defined below) (or by otherwise
changing or deleting Your account information), will only change the
information in Our database for future transactions and
communications from Us and/or third parties.  These changes will not
affect:  (1) information already collected as part of a particular
ticket purchase in Our database which may be shared with Our Event
Affiliates regardless of Your e-mail preferences; and (2) information
that We may have already forwarded to Event Affiliates, credit card
companies, or any other third parties, as provided above.  In this
instance, You would have to contact each of those entities
individually in order to make any changes to their use of Your
personally identifiable information.  If You opt-out and You still
receive these offers directly from Us, please contact Us at
<u><a href="mailto:legal@ticketleap.com">legal@ticketleap.com</a></u>
as soon as possible so that We can add Your name to Our opt-out list.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to process
transactions and payments on the Site, We will share Your personally
identifiable information with Our agents, representatives,
contractors, vendors, service providers, and credit card
issuers/banks so they can provide Us with support services such as
authorization of credit card transactions, order and ticket
fulfillment, and promotional fulfillment.  We have no control over
these parties and cannot guarantee that they will not share Your
personally identifiable information with other parties, as they may
have different privacy practices as to how Your information will be
handled.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When You purchase a
ticket or complete a registration form to any event listed on Our
Site, We will share Your personally identifiable information with the
venues, promoters, producers, organizers, managers, presenters,
artists, teams, organizations, business partners, authorized service
providers and other third-parties associated with that particular
event ("Event Affiliates").  We cannot offer You a separate
opportunity to opt-out, or not to consent, to Our sharing of Your
personally identifiable information with these parties, as explained
below.  Event Affiliates may use Your information in accordance with
their own privacy policies, and may consequently use Your personally
identifiable information to contact You and may share Your personally
identifiable information with others.  You will need to contact those
Event Affiliates on Your own initiative to instruct them directly
regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personally
identifiable information by them.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unless You opt-out, We
will use and disclose all information submitted by You for such
third-party offers in the same manner in which We use and disclose
all other information submitted by You for offers We sponsor.  We may
select third parties with whom We will share Your personally
identifiable information so that they can communicate directly with
You about their products and services.  We have no control over third
parties and cannot guarantee that they will not share Your personally
identifiable information with other parties, as they may have
different privacy practices as to how Your information will be
handled.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your personally
identifiable information may be given or transferred to a third party
in connection with a transfer or sale of ownership or assets of
Ticketleap, or in the event of a bankruptcy of Ticketleap.  We may
also disclose Your personally identifiable information to Our
subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated
legal entities and businesses.  However, all of the affiliated legal
entities and businesses that receive Your personally identifiable
information from Us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy
with respect to their use and disclosure of Your personally
identifiable information.  In addition, We can disclose Your
personally identifiable information to other parties when We, in Our
sole discretion, suspect or determine that Our Site is being used for
any unacceptable, inappropriate, or illegal purpose.  We may also
disclose this information where authorized by law or pursuant to any
authorized law enforcement investigation, regardless of whether it
was initiated by Us or by another party.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>How We Use Financial
Information</h4><p></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We use the term
"financial information" as a sub-category of personally
identifiable information relating to credit card, billing, and
payment information that You provide to Us when You transact business
on Our Site. We use Your financial information to bill You for
products and services and to enable You to participate in discount,
rebate, and similar programs in which You choose to participate.  By
making a purchase or engaging in any other kind of activity that uses
financial information on Our Site, You hereby consent and allow Us to
provide Your financial information to Our Event Affiliates, service
providers, credit card companies, banking institutions, processing
centers, and/or to such other third parties as We determine to be
necessary to handle and process Your transactions.  Except as
provided below, We do not make Your financial information available
to third parties unrelated to a particular event or transaction
without Your consent.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, as stated
earlier, depending upon the circumstances of Our ticketing service
arrangements with particular venues and event promoters, We may share
Your financial information with applicable Event Affiliates for the
primary purpose of dispute resolution and customer service at the
venue on, before or after the date of the event.  This sharing of
Your financial information may be necessary in order for You to gain
admittance to the event and for identification verification purposes
or to otherwise resolve any problems that occur while at the event.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As noted above with
personally identifiable information, financial information may given
or transferred to a third party in connection with a transfer or sale
of ownership or assets of Ticketleap, or in the event of a bankruptcy
of Ticketleap. We may also disclose Your financial information to Our
subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated
legal entities and businesses.  However, all of the affiliated legal
entities and businesses that receive Your financial information from
Us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to
their use and disclosure of Your financial information.  In addition,
We can disclose Your financial information to other parties when We,
in Our sole discretion, suspect or determine that Our Site is being
used for any unacceptable, inappropriate, or illegal purpose.  We may
also disclose this information where authorized by law or pursuant to
any authorized law enforcement investigation, regardless of whether
it was initiated by Us or by another party.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>How We Use Other
Information</h4><p></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We use Your other
non-personally identifiable information, such as general demographic
information, to customize the Site to the interests of Our users.  We
may share this information with Our Event Affiliates.  We may also
share anonymous, aggregated demographic information with advisors,
advertisers, investors and other third parties for general business
analysis purposes and so that advisors can customize their
advertisements, promotions, and communications to the appropriate
audience.  There may also be certain instances when We provide third
parties with Your personally identifiable and specific demographic
information on a non-anonymous basis.  We will not, however,
knowingly and intentionally provide these parties with Your financial
information.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>Your
Postings</h4>
<p></p><br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We may provide areas on
our Site where You can post information about Yourself, communicate
with others, post reviews or upload content.  Whenever
You disclose personal information publicly (such as on publicly
viewable web pages), that information becomes public and can be
collected and used by others.  We can’t control who reads Your
posting or what others may do with information You voluntarily post,
so we encourage You to use Your discretion with respect to posting
personal information.  Also, such postings are governed by Our
Terms of Service, so be sure to review them before posting.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>Visiting
Our Site from outside the United States</h4>
<p></p><br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Privacy Policy
covers the collection of information on the Site from United States
residents.  If You are visiting the Site from outside the United
States, please be aware that Your information may be transferred to,
stored, and processed in the United States where Our servers are
located and Our central database is operated.  United States data
protection and other laws may not be as comprehensive as those in
Your country.</p><br>

<p></p><h4>Our Security
Precautions</h4><p></p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We
attempt to protect Your personally identifiable information by
utilizing reasonable security measures to prevent loss, misuse,
alteration, unintentional destruction or unauthorized access.  We use
secure server software (SSL) for Your Site transactions.  We encrypt
all of Your personally identifiable information as it travels over
the Internet and We store Your financial information on Our servers
in encrypted form.  However, no system can be completely secure. 
Although We take very significant steps to secure Your information,
there is always a chance that Your information will not always remain
secure, and You should always take great care in handling and
disclosing Your personally identifiable information.  If You learn
that Our security measures have been compromised or have other
concerns, please inform Us immediately at <a href="mailto:legal@ticketleap.com" style="font-weight:bold;">legal@ticketleap.com</a>.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>Access to Your
Personally Identifiable and Other Account Information</h4><p></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When You register to
create an account with the Site or complete a purchase transaction on
the Site, We will either give You the opportunity to set certain
e-mail preferences when You register or make Your purchase, or We
will automatically set certain e-mail preferences for You.  When You
receive a confirmation e-mail from Us confirming Your registration or
purchase, You will be provided with a link to change these
preferences or Your registration information.  As noted earlier,
however, changing Your preferences will only affect future
communications directly from Us and not from Event Affiliates or
third parties who may have already received Your information.</p>
<br>
<p></p><h4>Contact Information</h4><p></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If
You have any questions or concerns about Our Privacy Policy or the
practices of the Site, You can contact Us at <a href="mailto:legal@ticketleap.com" style="font-weight:bold;">legal@ticketleap.com</a>.
 You can also send mail to Us at:  Privacy Officer, Ticketleap, Inc.,
1700 Sansom Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103.</p>
