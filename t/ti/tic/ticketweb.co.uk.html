				<p>This Policy explains what personal information TicketWeb, part of the Ticketmaster group of companies, (known in this Policy as “we” or “TicketWeb”) collects both online (including through apps) and offline and how we use it. Please read it carefully.</p>

				<p>Generally, we collect information about you if you create an account, from your purchase of tickets, when you email or call us, or from box office purchases operated or administered by us, and when you use our websites, apps and social media. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience).</p>

				<p>When you, for example, create an account, purchase tickets, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described below.</p>

				<p>As an authorised ticket agent, TicketWeb sells tickets on behalf of third parties who provide or sponsor an event, or who operate a venue where we hold events. We refer to these artists, agents, venues, promoters or sponsors from whom we obtain tickets to sell to you as our "<b>Event Partners</b>". We will share your information with our Event Partners and may share your information with other third parties, as further described <a href="#shareInfo">here.</a></p>

				<p>TicketWeb is responsible for the processing of your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

				<p><b>Cookies Notice</b></p>

				<p>We and third parties organisations use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags on our webistes and in our emails. For more information about cookies and how to disable cookies, please see our <a href="http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/help/cookiespolicy.html?l=en-us">Cookies Policy</a>.</p> 

				<p><b>We collect your information in different ways</b></p>

				<p><b>Directly from you.</b> For example, if you register for a promotion, create an account, enter a competition or free prize draw, download an app or buy tickets, post a comment on our websites, ask us a question, email us or interact with TicketWeb’s call centres.</p>

				<p><b>Through your use of our websites and apps.</b> You may view and use our websites and apps via a computer, phone, tablet or other device. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons on our websites and apps to collect information about your usage. To learn more, please see our <a href="http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/help/cookiespolicy.html?l=en-us">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>

				<p><b>From third parties.</b> For example, if you choose to use an integrated social media feature on our websites or apps, the third-party social media site will give us certain information about you. This could include your name and email address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social media platforms. Further information about the third parties from whom we obtain information is available <a href="#yourInfo">here</a>.</p>

				<p id="yourInfo"><b>Information we may hold about you</b></p>

				<p>We use the following information for the purposes described in this Policy:</p>

				<p><b>Your contact and account information.</b> We will hold contact information you provide to us (e.g. name, address, age, phone number, email, country of residence, preferred language) when you create a TicketWeb account, buy a ticket and/or participate in our competitions or promotions.</p>

				<p><b>Your payment and billing information.</b> We will hold payment and billing information you provide to us, e.g. credit card number and post code when you buy a ticket, in connection with the handling of your ticket orders. If you’ve asked us to, we may also store payment and billing information to make it easier for you to buy tickets in future.</p>
				
				<p><b>Information you post online.</b> For example, we hold information you post on our website or on a third-party social media site to which we have access (including reviews you post or surveys you complete). When you post information online, you must not infringe the rights of others (including privacy rights) and you should be aware that others may use, tag and/or re-publish your information in ways that you might not expect (including in ways that are unlawful). You understand that we and others (including our Event Partners) may use and re-publish any data you post online publicly, on our website or when using apps or social media tools.</p>

				<p><b>Information on your preferences.</b> We may collect information about events you like or products you buy or enquire about (e.g. as part of a survey or from your review of an event). We may also hold information on interests and demographic categories inferred from your interactions with us in order to provide you a better service and to provide you with more focused information. For example, if you buy tickets to a certain show and lots of people who went to that show also bought tickets for a different concert, we might send you information about that concert.</p>
				
				<p><b>Information from other companies.</b> We will hold information (e.g. your interests, purchases and household type or any information necessary to satisfy your request or fulfil your order) provided to us by other companies including our Event Partners. We may also add information to your details which we have obtained from other companies or sources. For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information. Much of this data is created using publicly available sources such as the edited electoral register or a publically available postal address list, or is derived from market research such as consumer panel surveys.</p>
				
				<p><b>Website usage information.</b> If you use our websites, we may collect information about the browser and device you're using and your IP address (this is a number that identifies a specific network device on the internet and is required for your device to communicate with websites). We might look at what site you came from, what you did and didn’t use our site for, or what site you visit when you leave us.</p> 
				
				<p><b>App(s) usage information.</b> If you use our app(s), we may collect your GPS location or your device's unique identifier. We might also collect the type of device you are using, or the version of the operating system your computer or device is running.
