		<h2>About TicketWeb and this Privacy Policy</h2>
		
		<p>TicketWeb (UK) Limited ("TicketWeb") is a company registered in England (company number 03617718) and a data controller registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (registration number Z6763724). Please read this privacy policy carefully, as it describes what personal information we collect and obtain and how we use it.
</p>
		
		<h2>The Information We Collect When You Use the Website</h2>
		
		<p>When you browse this website ("Site"), information about your visit is automatically stored in our web server logs. The server logs stores the details of the pages and content you request when you click on the links in our website. For example, it will store your IP address and the date and time of page requests.</p>
		
		<p>We also collect information about your website usage using cookies. For more information about the cookies on this Site and how to disable cookies, please read the <a href="http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/help/cookiespolicy.html?l=en-us">TicketWeb Cookie Policy.</a></p>
		
		<p>You can browse our Site without providing us any personal information, but to purchase tickets, you must create a <a href="https://www.ticketweb.co.uk/myAccount/login.php?language=en_us">MyTicketWeb account</a>. Once you register with TicketWeb some of the information we collect about your use of this Site will be linked to your <a href="https://www.ticketweb.co.uk/myAccount/login.php?language=en_us">MyTicketWeb account</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Information We Request Directly From You</h2>
		
		<p>We collect various personal details when you fill in our registration and order forms (like your name, phone numbers, address, email address etc). We also keep a record of your transactions with TicketWeb and any correspondence between us.</p>
		
		<p>You may be asked for further information if we run surveys, competitions, prize draws and other promotional activities. If this is the case, then this Privacy Policy will apply to the personal information you provide, but please check for any specific terms that apply each time you participate in these activities.</p>
		
		<p>If you'd prefer not to give us any personal information when you purchase tickets for events, then please visit the Box Office at the venue where an event is taking place.</p>
		
		<p>The financial information we collect and how we use it is explained later in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<h2>Information Which We Obtain</h2>
		
		<p>We may also add information to your details, which we have obtained from other companies or sources. For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information. Much of this data is created using publicly available sources such as the edited electoral register or the Postal Address File, or is derived from market research such as consumer panel surveys.</p>
		
		<h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Our Event Partners</strong></p>
		
		<p>As an authorised ticket agent, TicketWeb sells tickets on behalf the providers of the live events for which you buy tickets. This might be an artist, venue, promoter, fan club, sports club or organisation, producer or sponsor. We refer to the organisers or providers of an event as our "Event Partners". When you purchase tickets for an event, we share your personal information with our Event Partner, but only if you have bought tickets for the events that they are providing. There may be more than one Event Partner for each event.</p>
		
		<p>TicketWeb is data controller in respect of all of the information which TicketWeb collects and receives about you when you use our services. The Event Partner (in common with TicketWeb) is a data controller of the information which relates to their events.</p>
	   
		<p><strong>Our Group Companies</strong></p>
		
		<p>TicketWeb is proud to be a part of the Ticketmaster and Live Nation Entertainment group. We may share any or all of your information with our group companies for any of the purposes referred to in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<h2>Providing, Improving and Customising Our Services</h2>
		
		<p>We use your information primarily to provide you with the services and products you request, and related customer services (this includes providing this Site, website administration and security).</p>
		
		<p>We also analyse this information to improve our understanding of you and our customer base in general. We do this so that we can make better decisions about our services, advertising, products and content, based on a more informed picture of how our customers use our current services, and to provide you with a more customised experience.</p>
		
		<p>Depending on your marketing preferences, we may use this information to help us to determine which offers, information, discounts and promotions you would most like to receive.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Direct Marketing</strong></p>
		
		<p>When you first register with the Site, you can decide whether your contact information may be used by us, our Event Partners and selected third parties for direct marketing purposes. Depending on your selection, TicketWeb, its group companies, Event Partners and/or other third parties may contact you by e-mail or post with information or offers regarding their goods and services such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information.</p>
		
		<p>Unless you opt-out, TicketWeb may, from time to time, contact you by post or by electronic mail with information about upcoming shows and events.</p>
		
		<p>You will be given an opportunity to unsubscribe in every marketing e-mail we send you.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Changing your Marketing Preferences</strong></p>
		
		<p>If you change your mind or want to amend your marketing preferences, you can do so at any time from your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ticketweb.co.uk/myAccount/login.php?language=en_us">MyTicketWeb account</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Opt-out: You may opt out of any of TicketWeb's marketing communications at any time. If you wish to unsubscribe now, please contact TicketWeb at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@ticketweb.co.uk">unsubscribe@ticketweb.co.uk</a>. Please type "Unsubscribe" in the subject line. You can also send your request by post to TW Mailing Services, PO Box 43, London WC2H 7LD.</p>
		
		<p>Please note that our systems may take a little time to fully register your updates, so if you continue to receive emails in the 48 hours after making changes, please accept our apologies and ignore them.</p>
		
		<p>Please also note that you will always continue to receive customer service emails from TicketWeb - these include order confirmations, event reminders and information about changes to an event you've purchased tickets for.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Event Partner Marketing</strong></p>
		
		<p>You may also receive marketing information from the Event Partners for the events for which you have purchased tickets. If you do not wish to receive marketing correspondence from an Event Partner please use the unsubscribe link in their communications or contact them directly to request that your details are removed from their databases.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Carefully Selected Third Parties</strong></p>
		
		<p>If you've given your consent when registering for your personal information to be provided to carefully selected third parties (other than TicketWeb's Event Partners) they may contact you by post, telephone or email with information or offers regarding their goods and services.</p>
		
		<h2>Information Sharing and Transfer</h2>
		
		<p>TicketWeb and its Event Partners will not share your data with any third parties without your consent, except under the following circumstances:</p>
		
		<p>- if we use a third party supplier to carry out specific business operations (e.g. a mailing house, a courier, or a market research company) but only if we have in place a written agreement protecting your information;</p>
		
		<p>- if you have purchased other goods or services via our website such as ticket insurance or merchandise, in which case your information may be shared with third parties to process and fulfil your orders. Please see further information below in relation to how payment information is shared;</p>
		
		<p>- if TicketWeb uses group company facilities in the United States or other countries within the EU to carry out specific business operations (e.g. IT and hosting) but only if an adequate level of protection is in place to protect your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998;</p>
		
		<p>- if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer but only where we have taken reasonable steps to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information;</p>
		
		<p>- in order to enforce or apply our <a href="http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/help/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>, <a href="purchasepolicy.html">Purchase Policy</a> or any other applicable TicketWeb terms and conditions;</p>
		
		<p>- if you enter a competition, promotion or a prize draw, and TicketWeb is not the operator, the information you provide will be shared with the operator of the promotion, competition or prize draw;</p>
		
		<p>- if we consider it necessary to comply with laws or regulations, to assist law enforcement, to protect the rights, property, or safety of TicketWeb, our customers, users of this Site, or others;</p>
		
		<p>- if the data is only being shared in an anonymous and aggregate form; or</p>
		
		<p>- if TicketWeb or any of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case your information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
		
		<h2>Financial Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
		
		<p>If you are purchasing tickets, you will be asked to provide financial information (your payment card information). You will be given the option to save this information so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you buy tickets. If you select this option, we'll store your financial information for 12 months from the date of your most recent purchase, after which it will be deleted.</p>
		
		<p>Financial information we collect is used to authorise payment and bill you for your purchases through our Site. When you make a purchase on the Site, your consent is given to provide your financial or personal information to those third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as credit card companies and banks.
